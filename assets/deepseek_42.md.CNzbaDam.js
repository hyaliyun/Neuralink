Article: Get the local report from WJHG. (CNN) -- Clay Duke sat quietly through the first portion of the Bay District Schools, Florida, school board meeting Tuesday afternoon as local children were honored for their achievements. When it came time for citizens to bring up issues, the 56-year-old resident calmly approached the front. He spray painted a red \\"V\\" with a circle around it on the wall, brandished a small-caliber handgun and ordered the room cleared at a Panama City schools building. \\"Six men stay. Everyone else leave,\\" the burly gunman said. Moments later, Ginger Littleton, a board member, returned to the room and swung a purse at him. She ended up on the ground after the two struggled. The gunman cursed her, but did not open fire and he let her leave the room. Someone was going to die, he said. At that point, Duke, as seen on the dramatic live internet feed provided by CNN affiliates WJHG and WMBB, began a rambling discourse that included the apparent firing of his wife and sales taxes. The confrontation ended in the gunman identified as Duke calmly firing at the school officials, being wounded and, according to police, taking his own life. At first, school board members and Superintendent Bill Husfelt tried to reason with Duke, who had a criminal record. They talked about possibly finding a job for Duke's wife or looking into the case. Husfelt told the gunman that he likely signed the termination papers, but didn't recall the circumstances. \\"I'm the one who signed the papers,\\" Husfelt. \\"Let them go,\\" he said referring to the school board members. At one point, Husfelt said, \\"I don't want anybody to get hurt. I've got a feeling that what you want, is you want the cops to come in and kill you because you are mad. Because you said you are going to die.\\" \\"But why? This isn't worth it,\\" the superintendent told him. \\"This is a problem.\\" The gunman then pointed the pistol at the official. \\"Please don't. Please don't. Please,\\" Husfelt said. The gunman opened fire at Husfelt and school board members. He missed them all, even though he was at close range, said Lee Stafford, director of student services of Bay District Schools. Duke said, \\"I'm going to kill [unintelligible],\\" while he fired. Mike Jones, chief of security for the school system and a retired police officer, exchanged fire with Duke, who was wounded and rolled to the ground. Duke turned his gun on himself, dying of a fatal gunshot to the head, authorities said. Husfelt called Jones a \\"hero.\\" The gunman was declared dead at a local hospital. An autopsy is expected Wednesday. Police and school officials were left to piece together what happened. \\"I'm sure they never expected this kind of event to occur,\\" Sgt. Jeffrey Becker of the Panama City Police Department. The superintendent later related the event as being \\"surreal,\\" Becker said. Husfelt told reporters that Duke had almost a smile on his face. \\"He made up his mind. You could tell he was going to die.\\" The superintendent said he believes the gunman used a combination of live bullets and blanks. But police said live bullets were used. Husfelt told \\"AC360\\" Tuesday night that the gunman was \\"just mixed up\\" and that he tried to calm him down. \\"I knew the police were on their way.\\" \\"You knew he had something in mind he was going to do and it would not end well,\\" Husfelt said. The superintendent said he wanted to protect the school board members, but Duke did not want to talk. \\"The good Lord was standing in front of me,\\" said the school chief, adding authorities found two bullet holes behind his desk. Police have a solid lead on Duke's motive, Becker said, but were not prepared Tuesday night to release it. The investigation includes Duke's assertions that his wife had been terminated by the school district. Police were talking with Duke's wife, Becker said. School officials said they were unaware of the significance of the spray painting. But a Facebook page belonging to a Clay Duke has a profile photo of a \\"V\\" in a red circle, a logo that is used in the movie \\"V for Vendetta.\\" According to the Internet Movie Database, the 2006 film is about \\"a shadowy freedom fighter known only as \\"V\\" uses terrorist tactics to fight against his totalitarian society. Upon rescuing a girl from the secret police, he also finds his best chance at having an ally.\\" CNN could not verify if the Facebook page belonged to the gunman, but it does list Duke, 56, as living in Panama City, Florida. A biography on Duke's Facebook page reads: \\"My Testament: Some people (the government sponsored media) will say I was evil, a monster (V)... no... I was just born poor in a country where the Wealthy manipulate, use, abuse, and economically enslave 95% of the population. Rich Republicans, Rich Democrats... same-same... rich... they take turns fleecing us... our few dollars... pyramiding the wealth for themselves. The 95%... the us, in US of A, are the neo slaves of the Global South. Our Masters, the Wealthy, do, as they like to us...\\" Under \\"political views,\\" Duke labels himself a \\"Freedom Fighter.\\" Under religious views, he wrote, \\"Humanism.\\" Duke, who lived in Lynn Haven, a suburb of Panama City, has a previous record, Becker told CNN. According to the website of the Florida Department of Corrections, Duke was sentenced in 2000 for aggravated stalking, obstructing justice and throwing or shooting into a vehicle. According to the Panama City News Herald, after six months of stalking a former girlfriend, Duke confronted the woman outside her home on Oct. 20, 1999. He was wearing the mask and vest and holding two .22-caliber guns. He threatened to kill her, then kill several others and then himself, the newspaper said. When the woman tried to drive away, Duke shot out a rear tire. The photo of Duke on the corrections page matches the Facebook page. The News Herald reported that the gunman was taken out of the building on a stretcher. According to Panama City Police Chief John Van Etten, no one other than the suspect was injured, affiliate WJHG said. School board spokeswoman Karen Tucker said the man \\"was a large guy\\" she had seen sitting in the back of the boardroom earlier, according to the News Herald. Superintendent Husfelt will hold a press conference at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at the administration building in Panama City, police said. CNN affiliate WMBB reported children and parents were at the meeting to be recognized for achievements, but were gone before the incident began. \\"We are absolutely in state of shock,\\" said Stafford. \\"I was in the third floor and we were watching the live feed, and first we thought it was a drill. But the more that you watched it, we realized this was an actual incident and emergency situation.\\" Duke's Facebook page listed him as a 1972 graduate of King High School in Tampa. His favorite quotation: \\"You want the truth? You can't handle the truth,\\" from the movie \\"A Few Good Men.\\" From CNN's Vivian Kuo. ||||| A gunman who fired point-blank at school board members before fatally shooting himself had for much of the meeting sat with the rest of the audience, listening to routine business. This photo provided by the Florida Dept. of Corrections shows Clay Duke. (AP Photo/Florida Dept of Corrections) (Associated Press) As the board was in the midst of a discussion Tuesday, Clay A. Duke walked to the front of the room, spray painted a red \\"V\\" with a circle around it on the white wall, then turned and waved a handgun. He calmly ordered everyone to \\"hit the road\\" except the men on the board sitting behind a long beige desk. Despite his shock, Bay City Schools Superintendent Bill Hasfelt mustered a calm voice and tried to persuade Duke to drop the gun, but the 56-year-old ex-convict just shook his head, blaming officials for his wife being fired. Video showed him slowly raising the gun and leveling it at Husfelt, who pleaded \\"Please don't, please don't.\\" \\"We could tell by the look in his eyes that this wasn't going to end well,\\" Husfelt later told The Associated Press. Duke shot twice at Husfelt from about 8 feet away and squeezed off several more rounds before security guard Mike Jones bolted in and, after exchanging gunfire with Duke, wounded him in the leg or side. Duke then fatally shot himself, police Sgt. Jeff Becker said. Somehow, no one else who remained in the small board room was injured in the clash that lasted several minutes, and Husfelt said at least two rounds lodged in the wall behind him. \\"It was so surreal. You couldn't believe it was going on,\\" he said. Before the shooting started, the only woman on the five-member board _ who had left the room as ordered _ came back, sneaked up behind Duke and whacked his gun arm with her large, brown purse. \\"In my mind, that was the last attempt or opportunity to divert him,\\" Ginger Littleton told AP. Duke, a large, heavyset man dressed in a dark pullover coat, got angry, turned around, and she fell to the floor, as board members pleaded with her to stop. Duke pointed the gun at her head and said, \\"You stupid b----\\" but he didn't shoot her, she said. She's not sure why. \\"He had every opportunity to take me out,\\" she said. In his brief exchange with the board, Duke said his wife had been fired from the northern Florida district, but never told Husfelt or the board who she was or her job. Members promised to help her find a new job, but Duke just shook his head. Husfelt told Duke he would be responsible for her dismissal, so the board members should be allowed to leave. \\"He said his wife was fired, but we really don't know what he was talking about,\\" Husfelt told the AP at his Panama City home. \\"I don't think he knew what he was talking about.\\" Husfelt in the exchange on video tells Duke: \\"I've got a feeling you want the cops to come in and kill you because you said you are going to die today.\\" Later, the head of more than 30 district schools said he was sure someone was going to be killed. Tommye Lou Richardson, the school district's personnel director, who was at the meeting, called district security chief and former police officer Jones a hero. In the video, as Duke lay on the floor, colleagues comforted a shaken Jones, who said he had never shot anyone before. SWAT officers then storm the room and order everyone onto the ground. School officials tell them that Duke is shot and appears dead. His feet can be seen near the board's seats. The district said Jones would not be available for an interview. Minutes before Duke rose from his seat, the room had been filled with students receiving awards, Husfelt said. \\"It could have been a monumental tragedy.\\" Husfelt spoke to the AP wearing a sweat shirt and pajama bottoms, surrounded by his family. With a Christmas tree as backdrop, he said his faith anchored him during the ordeal and that he thought, \\"I don't want to die today but I'm prepared if I do. \\"God was standing in front of me and I will go to my grave believing that,\\" he said. As for the V inside a circle that Duke painted, it's the same symbol used in the graphic novel series and movie \\"V for Vendetta,\\" though police didn't talk about his motive. After everything stopped, some board members speculated that the bullets Duke was firing were fake or caps. But police say the gun was real _ and the video shows papers flying up on Husfelt's desk. Duke was charged in October 1999 with aggravated stalking, shooting or throwing a missile into a building or vehicle and obstructing justice, according to state records. He was convicted and sentenced in January 2000 to five years in prison and was released in January 2004. Records show Duke was a licensed massage therapist before his arrest but it wasn't clear if he was employed. Attorney Ben Bollinger, who represented Duke during his trial, told The News Herald of Panama City that Duke was waiting in the woods for his wife with a rifle, wearing a mask and a bulletproof vest. She confronted him and then tried to leave in a vehicle, and Duke shot the tires. He said that as part of his sentence, Duke was required to complete psychological counseling. Bollinger did not immediately return a phone message from the AP. \\"The guy obviously had a death wish,\\" district spokeswoman Karen Tucker said of Duke. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A gunman, Clay Duke, attended a Bay District Schools board meeting in Florida, where he spray-painted a red \\"V\\" on the wall and brandished a handgun.

After a few cars pass him by, Crump's brother recognizes and yells at a long-haired teen in an old Ford pickup who screeches to a stop to pick him up. Crump's brother is obviously a tough guy. He tells the driver about two girls he knows about in Torrance Beach that he's planning to spend the night with. Later that day at Petro Park, a hangout in Orange County, the driver of the pickup tells some other dudes (known as \\"the guzzlers\\"), about the two girls. Tack, one of the guzzlers, walks away from the others, obviously on some sort of mission.

They're looking to party, but there isn't much going on. As if to emphasize the point, Joe's 8-track copy of \\"Hocus Pocus\\" by Focus is eaten by the tape deck.

After failing to get Tack to reveal what he knows about the chicks, they reluctantly let him into the car.

Mama came over and sat down beside Alice . Gently she stroked *her* hair and let the child weep. - no - yes","completion":"Yes, in the given sentence, \\"Mama\\" and \\"her\\" point to the same thing. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's break down the sentence and analyze the pronouns and their respective antecedents. The sentence is: \\"Mama came over and sat down beside Alice. Gently she stroked *her* hair and let the child weep.\\" In this sentence, \\"Mama\\" is the subject and is performing the actions described. \\"Came over,\\" \\"sat down beside Alice,\\" \\"stroked,\\" and \\"let\\" are the verbs that describe the actions taken by the subject. Now, let's look at the pronouns used in the sentence. There are two pronouns: \\"she\\" and \\"her.\\" Pronouns are words that replace nouns in a sentence to avoid repetition and enhance clarity. 1. \\"she\\" - This pronoun is used in the second sentence, \\"Gently she stroked *her* hair and let the child weep.\\" Here, \\"she\\" refers to the person who is performing the action of stroking the hair and letting the child weep. Since \\"Mama\\" is the one who came over and sat down beside Alice, it is apparent that \\"she\\" refers to \\"Mama.\\" 2. \\"her\\" - This pronoun is also used in the second sentence as a possessive pronoun to indicate ownership or association. In this context, \\"her\\" is used to describe the hair that is being stroked. Since \\"Mama\\" is the one performing the action and \\"she\\" has already been established as referring to \\"Mama,\\" it is reasonable to conclude that \\"her\\" also points to \\"Mama\\" in this sentence. Thus, based on the sentence structure and the understanding of pronouns, we can confirm that both \\"Mama\\" and \\"her\\" point to the same thing, which is the mother or the female caregiver of Alice in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One missile landed in an uninhabited area while at least one more is thought to have landed in the sea off the city. Meanwhile, Israel's defence minister has authorised the call-up of 30,000 reservists. The BBC's Richard Galpin, in Jerusalem, says speculation is mounting that the Israeli army is preparing to launch a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip. Eighteen Palestinians have been killed in Israeli operations against militants in Gaza since Wednesday afternoon, when an Israeli air strike killed the military leader of Hamas, the militant group that controls the territory, in his car in Gaza City. Three Israelis have died during a barrage of hundreds of missiles fired from Gaza, mostly into southern Israel, some of which have been intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system. The rocket fired at Tel Aviv that came down on dry land hit a field in the suburb of Rishon Lezion, south of the city. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad said it had fired an Iranian-built, Fajr-5 rocket at Tel Aviv. By Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The danger of the kind of operation Israel has started is that rising casualties on both sides cause a violent escalation that neither side can control. If that happens it could cause a much bigger crisis across the Middle East. By Wyre DaviesBBC News, Gaza The overwhelming mood in Gaza is sombre but vengeful. Sombre because few here want another war with Israel - another war in which civilians would undoubtedly suffer as much as the fighters. By Yolande KnellBBC News, Kiryat Malachi There is a gaping hole on the top floor of an old four-storey apartment building where two Israeli families were living. A resident Yerumichael Simon told me: \\"I live across the street and I used to live inside that building.\\" BBC reporters on Israel-Gaza violence \\"We have widened the range of the battle to reach Tel Aviv and what is coming will be greater,\\" the group said in a statement. This is the first time Tel Aviv has been threatened by missiles since the first Gulf War, when missiles fired by Saddam Hussein's Iraq landed in the city. Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said: \\"This escalation will exact a price that the other side will have to pay.\\" The Hamas Prime Minister in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, condemned what he called Israel's \\"ferocious assault\\" against the territory. \\"We here in Gaza will remain steadfast and unshaken,\\" he said in a televised statement. \\"We will fend off the aggression. \\"We are all confident in our intrepid resistance fighters who are now deployed on the front.\\" Late on Thursday, BBC correspondents in Gaza reported several massive explosions and missile fire in and around Gaza City as Israeli strikes continued. Many of the Palestinians killed in Gaza during the last two days by the Israeli aerial and naval bombardment were members of militant groups, but civilians - including at least four children - were also among the dead. They included 11-month-old Omar, the son of Jihad Misharawi, a BBC Arabic picture editor. The three Israeli civilians who died - two women and a man - were killed on the top floor of a block of flats in the southern town of Kiryat Malachi that suffered a direct hit by a rocket. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will do \\"everything in its power\\" to avoid civilian casualties in the conflict with Hamas. But he said Hamas was deliberately placing its rockets and missiles in civilian areas prior to launching them at Israel. \\"There is no moral symmetry between Israel and the terrorists in Gaza,\\" he said during a televised news conference in Tel Aviv. \\"Hamas deliberately targets our children and they deliberately place their rockets next to their children. Now despite this reality - and it's a difficult reality - Israel will continue to do everything in its power to avoid civilian casualties.\\" Egypt's new Islamist President Mohammed Mursi called the Israeli bombardment \\"unacceptable aggression\\". Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil is to travel to Gaza on Friday in a show of support for the people of the territory. The United States, Israel's key ally, has called on countries that have contact with Hamas to urge it to stop rocket attacks from Gaza. \\"We've... urged those that have a degree of influence with Hamas such as Turkey, and Egypt and some of our European partners to use that influence to urge Hamas to de-escalate,\\" said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, in a conference call with reporters. Asked if the US was concerned that Israeli ground forces would enter Gaza, Mr Rhodes said: \\"Ultimately it's up to the Israeli government to make determinations about how they're going to carry out their military objectives.\\" Arab League foreign ministers plan to meet in emergency session on Friday to discuss the escalating violence. Israel's aerial and naval bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which began after a recent wave of rocket attacks from there, is its most intense assault on the Palestinian territory since it launched a full-scale invasion four years ago, also in response to rocket fire. Summary:","completion":"The summarized report discusses the events following air raid sirens alarming the residents of a missile threat, the first since 1991. One missile landed in an unpopulated area and some more are speculated to have fallen into the sea near the city. Israel's Defence Minister authorized the draft of 30,000 reservists amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Gaza Strip. Post the killing of Hamas's military leader in an Israeli air strike, 18 Palestinians have been reported dead in subsequent operations against the Gaza militants. Three Israelis have also lost their lives due to the hundreds of missiles fired from Gaza. Commenting on the situation, Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen highlighted the danger of this escalated operation, suggesting it could induce a violent escalation leading to a wider crisis across the Middle East. The residents of Gaza are described as somber yet revengeful due to these developments. A significant impact was the destruction of a four-storey building in Kiryat Malachi where two Israeli families residing were affected. Correspondingly, Tel Aviv experienced a missile threat for the first time since the first Gulf War. Israel's Defence Minister Ehud Barak indicated further escalation would extract a high price that the opposing side would have to pay. The Hamas Prime Minister, Ismail Haniyeh, criticized Israel's aggressive assault on their territory, assuring they will combat the aggression with resilience. Reports of massive explosions around Gaza were reported, and Israeli aerial and naval strikes have continued. Despite most casualties being militants, civilians, and children, are also victims. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel would put its best efforts to avoid civilian casualties, accusing Hamas of intentionally placing rockets in civilian locations. Responding to this crisis, Egypt's President Mohammed Mursi declared Israel's actions as \\"unacceptable aggression\\" and is sending his Prime Minister, Hisham Qandil, to show support to the people of Gaza. The United States urged nations having contacts with Hamas to convince it to stop rocket attacks from Gaza. The Arab League foreign ministers are planning an emergency meet to talk over the escalating violence. The ongoing events are the most intense Israeli assault on Gaza since their full-scale invasion four years ago, also in reply to rocket fire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Superman II Movie plot: Prior to the destruction of Krypton, the criminals General Zod, Ursa and Non disable a security guard at a crystalline matrix table. The general removes a red spire from the table and destroys it; the thunderclap as the piece is shattered resonates through the city and sets off a trap that ensnares the three brigands. The red spire's destruction is clearly an act of treason, and for this and other crimes they are sentenced by Jor-El for banishment into the Phantom Zone.Many years after traveling through the galaxy, the Phantom Zone is shattered near Earth by the shockwave from the harmless detonation of a hydrogen bomb launched into space by Superman. The three criminals are freed, finding themselves with super powers granted by the yellow light of Earth's sun. After attacking human astronauts on the moon and the small town of East Houston, Idaho, the three travel to the White House and force the President of the United States to surrender to Zod (on behalf of the entire planet) during an international television broadcast. When the President warns Zod that Superman will stop them, Zod announces his demand for Superman to come and \\"kneel before Zod!\\"Prior to Zod's arrival, Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent on assignment for the Daily Planet to Niagara Falls. Lois becomes suspicious that Clark is Superman and tries to lure him into revealing his identity by throwing herself into the Falls, but Clark manages to save her with subtle use of his powers. That night, Clark accidentally reaches into the room's fireplace to recover his glasses after he trips; when Lois discovers his hand is not even burnt, Clark is forced to admit he is Superman. He takes her to his Fortress of Solitude near the North Pole and shows her the traces of his past stored in the energy crystals of the Fortress, one of which is the green crystal that created the Fortress and opened Superman's contact with his long-deceased parents.

In a recent interview with Buzzfeed on \\"CBS This Morning\\" the comedian was asked about the fact that most of the guests on his Web series \\"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\\" have been white males. Seinfeld's initial response was \\"It really pisses me off.\\" \\"People think [comedy] is the census or something, it's gotta represent the actual pie chart of America,\\" he said. \\"Who cares?\\" With his Super Bowl commercial, Seinfeld is back on the radar, but his comments come at the same time as debate about diversity in comedy. \\"Saturday Night Live\\" hired its first black female cast member in years after an outcry over the show's lack of diversity. Gawker writer Kyle Chayka writes that by Seinfeld saying, \\"I have no interest in gender or race or anything like that,\\" the comic \\"seems to suggest that any comedian who is not a white male is also not funny, though he's also likely fed up with the amount of bad comedy he's been forced to sit through in his (waning) career.\\" \\"Which is too bad, because Seinfeld is downplaying the work of everyone from Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby to Aziz Ansari, Mindy Kaling, and Eddie Huang, who are all in various stages of their own sitcoms that just might turn out to be the next 'Seinfeld,' \\" Chayka writes.

Context: Cancer is one of the devastating neovascular diseases that incapacitate so many people the world over. Recent reports from the National Cancer Institute indicate some significant gain therapy and cancer management as seen in the increase in the 5-year survival rate over the past two decades. Although near-perfect cure rate have been reported in the early-stage disease, these data reveal high recurrence rate and serious side effects including second malignancies and fatalities. Most of the currently used anticancer agents are only effective against proliferating cancer cells. Thus attention has been focused on potential anti-cancer agents capable of killing cancer cells independent of the cell cycle state, to ensure effective elimination of most cancer cells. The objective of this study was to test the chemosensitivity and potential mechanism of action of a novel cancer drug, CytoregR, in a panel of human cancer cells.', 'the study was performed using a series of bioassays including Trypan blue exclusion, MTS Growth inhibition, LDH-cytotoxicity, TUNEL-Terminal DNA fragmentation Apoptosis Assay, and the Caspase protease CPP32 activity assays.', 'CytoregR induced significant dose- and time-dependent inhibition of growth in all the cells; with significant differences in chemosensitivity (P < 0.05) between the target cells becoming more apparent at 48 hr exposure. CytoregR showed no significant effect on normal cells relative to the tumor cells. Growth inhibition in all the cells was due to induction of apoptosis at lower concentrations of cytoregR (> 1:300). CytoregR-induced caspase protease-3 (CPP32) activation significantly and positively correlated with apoptosis induction and growth inhibition; thus implicating CPP32 as the principal death pathway in cytoregR-induced apoptosis. Answer: CytoregR exerted a dose-and time-dependent growth inhibitory effect in all the target cells through induction of apoptosis via the CPP32 death pathway, independent of hormonal sensitivity of the cells. The present data indicate that not only could CPP32 provide a potential target for regulation of cytoregR-induced apoptosis but also that cytoregR could play a significant role in chemotherapeutic regimen in many human malignant tumors.

Wasim Akram (Urdu: wsym khrm; born 3 June 1966) is a former Pakistani first-class cricketer, cricket commentator and television personality. He is acknowledged as one of the greatest bowlers of all time. A left-arm fast bowler who could bowl with significant pace, he represented the Pakistan cricket team in Test cricket and One Day International (ODI) matches. In October 2013, Wasim Akram was the only Pakistani cricketer to be named in an all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. During his professional career he bowled with genuine speed and hostility. Akram was a man possessed of accurate control of line and length, accompanied by seam and swing bowling skills, extended to both inswingers and outswingers. With a very quick bowling action, he could bowl equally well from both sides of the wicket. His mastery of reverse swing with the cricket ball meant he was at his most dangerous towards a bowling innings, and earned him the nickname of one of the \\"Sultans of Swing\\", the other one being Waqar Younis. As well as often being able to find the edge of the bat, Akram would also focus his bowling attack on the stumps and had a particularly lethal inswinging yorker. Of his 414 Test wickets, 193 were taken caught, 119 were taken leg before wicket and 102 were bowled. In partnership with Waqar Younis, he intimidated international batsmen in the 1990s. Together Wasim and Waqar, known as \\"the two Ws\\" of the Pakistani team, were one of the most successful bowling partnerships in cricket. With the bat he was especially effective against spin bowlers. However, he liked to slog and was criticised for his lack of high scores and giving away his wicket too cheaply. In October 1996 he scored 257 runs not out, of the team's total of 553 against lowly Zimbabwe on a typical flat South Asian pitch at Sheikhupura. He also achieved good scores for the Pakistan team such as his scores of 123 and 45* against Australia to take Pakistan to victory in a low scoring match. His batting was also valuable sometimes to the Pakistan ODI side, such as in the Nehru Cup in 1989, when needing six runs and two balls to win the match, he hit the first delivery he faced, from part-time off-spinner and batting legend, Viv Richards, for a six and secured the cup. In December 2012 after Ricky Ponting announced his retirement he said that Wasim Akram and Curtly Ambrose were the toughest bowlers he had faced \\"Akram for the exact opposite, you could get a few runs off him, but you just knew there was an unplayable ball around the corner, be it with an old ball or with a new ball,\\" - Ricky Ponting.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How did he get the nickname \\"sultans of swing\\"","completion":"The nickname \\"Sultans of Swing\\" for Wasim Akram (and also his bowling partner Waqar Younis) was derived from his mastery of swing bowling. In cricket, swing bowling is a technique where the ball curves in its trajectory, making it challenging for the batsman to play. Akram's prowess didn't just revolve around traditional swing, but he also had a handle on reverse swing - a more complex and challenging type of swing that involves the ball swinging in the opposite direction to what is expected, often confounding batsmen. The enormous level of dexterity this required was not common among bowlers, making Akram and Younis stand out. With his fast-paced, left-arm style, he was able to generate significant swing on each delivery, either in-swingers (moving the ball towards a right-handed batsman) or out-swingers (moving the ball away from a right-handed batsman). This ability to generate swing both ways, and his speed and accuracy, resulted in Akram being highly effective in his bowling, and it became a hallmark of his play. The nickname \\"Sultans of Swing\\" can also be traced back to the dominance of Akram and Younis in the 1990s, where their ability to swing the ball, both with the old and new ball, left batsmen struggling and altered the outcomes of many matches. Together Akram and Younis were known as the \\"two Ws\\" and their lethal partnership became symbolic of Pakistan cricket. To summarize, Wasim Akram got the nickname \\"Sultans of Swing\\" due to his incredible control over swing bowling, his ability to swing the ball both ways at high speed, and his intimidating partnership with Waqar Younis that dominated the cricket scene in the 1990s. His ability to command the cricket ball and make it swing adeptly earned him this befitting nickname."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

These wonderful women enjoyed doing fun things like going for walks, seeing pretty flowers, and visiting animals in their homes. They especially loved learning about all the different creatures they could find, like birds singing in the trees or little crawly bugs under rocks. One of their favorite activities was \\"reeling\\" or fishing in the sparkling rivers and lakes.

This was so exciting for them! After they caught some fish, these lovely ladies would let them go back into the water so they could continue swimming and playing with their fish friends. They believed in taking care of the animals and nature they loved so much. When they weren't fishing, these women liked to sit around a cozy campfire, telling stories while roasting marshmallows and making s'mores.

Q: If I tell you that Temperature mostly influences plant growth, biodiversity, and adaptations of land organisms, and ask you the question \\"what mostly influences plant growth, biodiversity, and adaptations of land organism?\\", is the correct answer \\"summer\\"? Possible answers: (1). Yes; (2). No; A:","completion":"(2). No; The correct answer is not \\"summer\\". The primary factor that mostly influences plant growth, biodiversity, and adaptations of land organisms is temperature, as mentioned earlier in your statement. While summer may indeed bring warmer temperatures that can affect these aspects of plant and animal life, it is not the overall determining factor. Temperature fluctuations occur throughout the year in different seasons and have specific impacts on the living organisms in an area. Temperature significantly influences plant growth by impacting photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, and overall metabolism rates. In general, higher temperatures often lead to increased growth rates, while lower temperatures can slow down or even halt growth. However, different species of plants have evolved to be optimally adapted to the temperatures in their native environments. Biodiversity is also affected by temperature in that it determines the range of species that can live and thrive in a given ecosystem. Higher temperatures support a wider variety of species, which often results in increased biodiversity. However, this relationship can be quite complex as other factors like precipitation, altitude, and habitat availability can also influence biodiversity. In terms of adaptations, land organisms have evolved various strategies to survive and thrive in the temperatures found in their native ecosystems. Some adaptations include: 1. Morphological adaptations: Land organisms may develop specific physical traits to help them cope with temperature variations. Examples include fur thickness in animals, leaf size and shape in plants, and unique body structures that enable thermoregulation. 2. Behavioral adaptations: Organisms might change their behaviors to respond to temperature changes, such as seeking shade, migrating to cooler locations, or altering their daily activity patterns to adapt to the heat or cold. 3. Physiological adaptations: Some organisms possess internal mechanisms to withstand temperature fluctuations. These adaptations can include increased metabolic rates to generate heat in cold environments, cooling mechanisms (e.g., sweating or panting) in warm environments, or producing antifreeze proteins to prevent tissue damage in freezing temperatures. In conclusion, while summer may have an impact on plant growth, biodiversity, and adaptations of land organisms, it is not the primary factor influencing these aspects. Temperature primarily drives these changes, and it is essential to understand the complex relationships between temperature, plant growth, biodiversity, and adaptations of land organisms in various ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999.

It wasn't the most pointless animation film experience ever, but it certainly can't be admired as much as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later named Spirit (Matt Damon, providing the first person narration), and his journey through across the frontiers of the Old West. Basically he is born free amongst all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, he manages to throw off all who try to ride him. However when he escapes his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two of them form a friendship, oh, and he obviously has a thing for Little Creek's female horse. In the end, after a few more escapes, being chased by The Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and making a final big leap across a gorge, Little Creek lets Spirit go, and he also releases his female horse, and they run home to their countryside and fellow horses.

Movie title: Under Siege 2: Dark Territory Movie plot: Casey Ryback (Seagal) has retired from the Navy and is a chef at the Mile High Cafe in Denver, Colorado. Ryback is taking his estranged niece Sarah Ryback (played by a then-unknown Heigl) to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Ryback's brother, who was Sarah's father. They board a train traveling through the Rocky Mountains from Denver to Los Angeles. As the train proceeds through the Rockies, two people wave it down. The driver and an engineer step out and are killed. A group of mercenaries led by computer genius Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) and mercenary leader Penn (McGill) hijack the train. Dane is a satellite programming expert who worked on a top secret satellite laser weapon called \\"Grazer One\\". Dane was fired and faked his death. They herd the passengers and staff into the last two train cars and cut the train's phone lines. Two of Dane's former Department of Defense colleagues are on board the train, hiding their romantic relationship that goes against DoD regulations. Dane has them brought to him and threatens to have one of his mercenaries insert a burning needle into their eye, causing it to explode, unless they give him the codes needed to take over Grazer One. They give him the codes and Dane has them killed. Middle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane one billion dollars to destroy the Eastern seaboard by using Grazer One to target a nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon. Dane blows up a Chinese chemical plant in order to demonstrate Grazer One's capabilities to his investors and, after one investor offers an additional 100 million dollars, Dane destroys an airliner carrying the investor's ex-wife. The US government cannot locate Dane's headquarters and cannot target Grazer One because Dane creates fifty \\"ghost satellites\\" to hide the location of the real Grazer One. When officials destroy what they think is Grazer One, it turns out that they destroyed the NSA's best intelligence satellite. As long as the train keeps moving, his location cannot be fixed.

He continued that offshore flow products such as index options and equity swaps for the Korean market totaled about USD100 million this year. Chiang added that with the new regulations enacted, the Korean OTC market is set to grow, likely expanding by over 50% in the first year and substantially higher after that. \\"We've been waiting for this for a long time,\\" noted one equity derivatives regional head at a global firm in Hong Kong. \\"This is good news,\\" he continued, \\"this will in effect open up the onshore market for international players.\\" Currently, international firms trade primarily in the offshore market. Condensed default swap confirmation launched IFR - November 24, 2001 IP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley last week introduced a credit default swap master agreement to the European market, which reduces documentation to a one-page confirmation form. The master agreement is based on the 1999 International Swaps and Derivatives Association credit derivatives definitions, but 22 of the 30 clauses that are typically subject to agreement are standardised under the shorter master agreement, leaving only eight clauses to be agreed for each trade. The two banks said that use of the new master agreement would allow quicker trade confirmation, reduce operational risk and should eventually improve market liquidity. They did their first trade using the new master agreement last Tuesday and had closed a total of six deals using the new form by Friday. The two banks' London offices typically trade credit derivatives with one another five to 10 times a week. The new agreement had not been adopted by any other dealers by the end of last week, and traders expressed some surprise that the two US banks had launched the document on their own, without consultation under the aegis of trade group ISDA. \\"That would have taken quite a long time, and at the end of the day these are bilateral contracts,\\" said Guy America, European head of credit derivatives trading at JP Morgan Chase. Both banks intend to use the agreement in their default swap trades with other dealers and expect it eventually to prove popular throughout the market. \\"I don't see any reason going forward why it would not be rolled out to end users of the product,\\" said Annabel Littlewood, European head of credit derivatives trading at Morgan Stanley. She added that JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have agreed to use the new master document in trades between their New York dealing desks, with amendments to be made for local market practice. US dealers typically use the modified definition of restructuring as a credit event, and two weeks ago they dropped the use of the obligation acceleration clause as a standard feature of default swaps. Banks move to boost credit derivatives liquidity Risk News - November 23, 2001 By John Ferry JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have agreed to standardise most of the items on their European credit swap master agreements, in a move designed to increase liquidity in the credit derivatives market. By cutting the widely used International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation down from several pages to just one, the banks aim to minimise the time taken to execute and confirm a trade while reducing documentation risk. \\"Frequent credit swap traders will be able to increase the volume of confirmed trades, thereby increasing market liquidity and growth of the credit derivatives business,\\" said the banks in a joint statement. Standard ISDA master agreements for credit swaps have 30 negotiable items. JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley's shortened version leaves only eight items open to discussion. The banks said the one-page confirmation form contains only the \\"key commercial terms\\", including the name of the underlying company, the notional involved and the price and duration of the trade. The banks claim this will eliminate the risk of a party missing a modified term or adding terms that were not previously agreed. Guy America, head of European credit derivatives trading at JP Morgan Chase in London, said the development of the credit derivatives market will receive a boost as a result of the agreement. \\"The new agreement now looks very similar to an interest rate swap contract,\\" he said. Annabel Littlewood, head of European credit derivatives trading at Morgan Stanley in London, said it took around a year to finalise the agreement. \\"It's been quite a struggle getting to the point where dealers agree on the major terms in the contracts.\\" Fitch Plans Credit Hiring Spree Derivatives Week - November 26, 2001 Fitch plans to hire six or seven collateralized debt obligation professionals for its London-based CDO rating team because of the increase in the number of deals coming to the market. Mitchell Lench, senior director in London, said it has about 15 CDOs in the pipeline this month in comparison to five or six this time last year, approximately one-third of these are synthetic or balance sheet transactions. Lench expects the new recruits to start in the first half of next year and to come from structuring houses, investment firms or competitors. The hires will include a lawyer familiar with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's documentation. There are currently 10 professionals in the CDO team in London. Lench said it is becoming easier for rating agencies to hire top personnel because the wage differential between the agencies and the sellside firms has decreased. He added recruits also join rating agencies for job security and to get a bird's eye view of the market. Cross-Border Security Transactions Costing More Than Domestic Ones, EC Says BNA - November 26, 2001 Despite an increase in the demand for securities by foreign investors because of the euro, there is a highly fragmented system in the European Union when it comes to cross-border clearing and settlement, concluded a new report published Nov. 23 on behalf of the European Commission. Moreover, the cost of clearing and settling a foreign security transaction can be 10 times as much as a domestic sale. \\"There is no European financial market right now and one has to wake up to this reality,\\" said Alberto Giovannini, the chairman of a group that wrote the report. Legislative Proposal Planned As a result of the report, the EU executive body said it will begin a legislative process in 2002 to reverse the inefficiencies in the EU system. At the same time, the commission urged financial markets to find market-based solutions within the framework of the EU competition law. \\"The additional cost and risk associated with a fragmented clearing and settlement infrastructure represents a significant limitation on the scope for cross-border securities trading in the EU,\\" said EU Economics Commissioner Pedro Solbes. \\"By extension it also represents an important limitation on exploiting the economic benefits of the internal market and the euro.\\" Three Main Problems Cited The three main problems highlighted in the report are as follows: * national differences in technical requirements and market practice; * national differences in tax procedures; * issues relating to legal certainty. While the report says financial markets could do much when it comes to convergence and ensuring inter-operability as regards technical requirements and market practices across national systems, it is up to governments and the European Commission to deal with matters related to taxation and legal certainty. Enter the FSA Financial Times - November 26, 2001 Midnight on Friday will be a historic moment for Britain's financial services industry. At that hour its new system of regulation under the Financial Services Authority will come fully into effect, more than four years after it was first proposed by the Labour government. How the FSA handles its new powers, such as personal fines for wrongdoing by directors, will have a profound impact on the City of London and its place as a global financial centre. It will be closely watched by countries considering a similar move. The legislation that created the FSA - rightly amended to curb its powers to punish - is broadly sensible. The authority replaces 10 self-governing industry bodies that have not always regulated consistently or with sufficient bite. The aim is to make regulation more efficient and more alert to the scandals that have regularly plagued the City. The legislation leaves wide discretion to the authority. But Sir Howard Davies, its chairman, has promised a new and sensible risk-based approach: resources will be focused on preventing problems where failure is most likely rather than on routine visits to well run companies. Better businesses should enjoy a lighter regulatory touch. That is fine in principle but the City awaits the new policeman with apprehension. There are three main worries. First, that it will prove heavy-handed. There are widespread complaints that while senior FSA staff are excellent, more junior ones still suffer from a box-ticking mentality. Compliance costs, it is said, have been rising - a particular worry for small companies. Second, there is concern that the authority may stretch itself too thinly. A recent report on Equit-able Life criticised the FSA's role, including its poor internal co- ordination. Third, there is a fear the FSA will adopt an excessively aggressive approach in its pursuit of wrong-doing, particularly for the newly created offence of \\"market abuse\\", and might go for some early high-profile scalps. The authority denies this, as well it might. A reputation for inquisitions would serve it ill. Some of the City's concerns stem from natural tensions between regulator and regulated. But the FSA, which can sometimes appear overly sensitive to criticism, needs to be alert to these anxieties if it is to start on the right note. The main test will be to produce a flexible, low-cost regime that is firm yet fair, while encouraging innovation and London's growth as a global centre. This will be a difficult balance - but the FSA's short life so far offers hope that it will get it broadly right. FSA to open securitised derivatives to retail sector Risk News - November 21, 2001 The UK's financial watchdog, Financial Services Authority (FSA), plans to allow retail investors to invest directly in securitised derivatives for the first time by initiating a flexible listing regime. The proposals, which will be relevant to issuers of listed securities and derivatives, have been released in a consultation paper, 'Proposed Listing and Conduct of Business Rules for Securitised Derivatives', after discussions with market participants and international regulators. The idea to list retail covered warrants was first raised by the FSA in January this year. The new proposals offer a wider and more flexible regime that includes other types of derivatives. The paper details the determination of who can issue securitised derivatives and the information about these products that must be disclosed. The FSA's proposals focus on establishing the suitability of retail investors to purchase securitised derivatives and the qualification of IFAs (independent financial advisers) and brokers to advise on derivatives. The listing of securitised derivatives will also include a risk warning with full disclosure of the risks associated with these products, alongside details of the product, how it works and how the investor's return is calculated. Issuers of securitised derivatives will also need to be regulated by the FSA and permitted to conduct business in derivatives. Ken Rushton, director of listings at the FSA, said: \\"Market participants believe there will be a demand for these products, which are very popular in some European countries. The FSA believes there is the potential for the market in the UK for these products to be substantial if UK investors show a similar appetite for these products as they have for other products such as spread betting and options.\\" Dealers hope for clarity on swap books IFR - November 24, 2001 Some clarification is expected this week on how the US courts may rule on the Internal Revenue Service's challenge to dealers' methods for valuing income from swaps. Closing arguments in Bank One Corporation v Commissioner are set to begin on Wednesday. Although no decision is expected before March or April next year, the nature of the questions asked by the judge during the closing arguments may be telling, industry executives believe. The IRS's case is that the method for valuing First Chicago's swaps portfolio between 1991 and 1993 included inappropriate downward adjustments for credit risk and administrative costs. This, the IRS alleges; led the dealer to underestimate the value of its income from derivatives, and thereby reduced its taxable income base. Bank One acquired First Chicago more than three years ago. Bank One claims that the method used was common practice at the time. In a brief filed this summer the bank also said that its numbers were more accurate with the adjustments than without. It is proposing to use an adjusted mid-market approach to valuing income from swaps. To the annoyance of some in the derivatives industry, the IRS's 600-page brief submitted in September did not tell dealers what recipe they should use for valuing income from swaps. \\"They only put forward a brief saying that the way Bank One did it was wrong,\\" one firm's lawyer said. \\"[The government's position] can't be applied somewhere else. And it doesn't tell an IRS agent how to audit [another dealer].\\" The IRS was not under any obligation to come up with a better method, though this would have been helpful, the lawyer said. The problem with an across-the board use of a mid-market approach of the type used by Bank One is that banks using this approach rarely mark up their valuations because of their own credit risk, said Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at Stanford University's business school who is one of two court-appointed experts for the case. One partial way to address this would be to disallow mark-downs from mid-market value when a counterparty has the same or higher credit quality, said Duffie. Under a slightly more refined guideline, banks would mark down swaps based on the credit quality of its counterparty relative to its own quality. \\"For example, if an A rated bank issuing debt at 20bp over Libor signs a swap with an A- counterparty issuing at 50bp over Libor, then the swap could be marked down based on a mean (relative) loss rate of 50-20=30bp per year, per dollar of expected exposure,\\" said Duffie. \\"This is not text-book perfect, but would capture the majority of the effect of relative quality. [Also] it would not require new software, just a shift in model inputs for mean loss rates.\\" **End of ISDA Press Report for November 26, 2001** THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF, ISDA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA ONLY.

During their engagement party, Ethan is contacted by IMF Operations Director Musgrave (Billy Crudup) who provides him with a disposable camera. After viewing a video hidden in the camera, he finds out Musgrave wants him to rescue Agent Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell), Ethan's protégé, who has been captured in Berlin by Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a prominent dealer in the international black market (the captor from the opening). He reluctantly agrees to participate in the mission and meets the team which has been selected for him, consisting of Declan Gormley (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), Zhen (Maggie Q), and his old partner, Luther Stickel (Ving Rhames).The team assaults an enemy stronghold in Berlin and extracts Agent Farris successfully, but she dies during their escape when an explosive capsule placed inside her head detonates. After Lindsey's funeral, Ethan is notified of a \\"package\\" sent to him by Lindsey, and discovers that it is a microdot hidden under the stamp in a blank postcard. Ethan discusses its possible importance with Luther and both decide to keep its existence a secret.Using information recovered from a laptop in the Berlin mission, Ethan then decides to go after Davian himself, targeting him at a meeting in Vatican City, where a lucrative transaction involving a mysterious object, codenamed \\"The Rabbit's Foot\\", is apparently taking place.

Who won the Golden Ball Award for best player at the 2006 FIFA World Cup?","completion":"The Golden Ball award, which recognizes the best player in the FIFA World Cup, is one of the most prestigious individual accolades in the world of football. At the conclusion of the tournament, journalists from around the globe cast their votes to determine the recipient of the award, which ultimately represents the top athlete's outstanding contribution towards their team's success. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, held in Germany, France's legendary midfielder, Zinedine Zidane, won the Golden Ball Award. This tournament was Zidane's final World Cup appearance, as he had announced his plan to retire from professional football following the conclusion of the championship. The award emphasized the impact Zidane made on the field throughout the tournament, as his performance was nothing short of exceptional. At age 34, Zidane demonstrated his mastery of the game by dictating the tempo of matches and skillfully orchestrating his team's offensive and defensive plays. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, France reached the final to face Italy, and Zidane played a pivotal role in guiding his team to this accomplishment. He scored three crucial goals over the course of the tournament, including a memorable penalty during the semi-final shootout against Portugal and an inch-perfect Panenka-style penalty in the final against Italy. However, the final also played host to Zidane's infamous headbutt incident involving Italian defender Marco Materazzi, which led to his dismissal from the game. In a controversial and career-defining moment, Zidane was sent off for violent conduct, leaving his team with one player short during the final moments of extra time. Ultimately, Italy triumphed in the penalty shootout, subsequently securing their fourth World Cup title. Despite the infamous end to his career, Zidane's performances leading up to that point earned him the Golden Ball, making him the third French player to claim the award. Though his actions in the final somewhat marred his triumph, few can dispute the incredible skill, vision, and sheer brilliance that marked his overall play in the 2006 FIFA World Cup."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, her grandmother took away all the money and put it in a bank account. Many students experienced the same thing as Chen. They got their gift money, only to immediately have it taken away. Xiong Shengyue, 14, from Nanjing, doesn't agree with the practice. \\"I think the money should be the children's, \\" she said. \\" We should take care of it by ourselves.\\" It is not that simple, said Chu Chaohui, a researcher at national Institute of Education Sciences. Giving gift money is used to show social status and develop relationships, he told Beijing Legal Evening News. Gift money has lost its traditional meaning of good will and has \\"little to do with the children\\". What's more, children don't earn the money through work. So he thought that parents should still play a big part in dealing with the money. But Yan Honglan, a mother of a 14-year-old boy in Beijing, has let her son be responsible for his gift money since the age of 8. \\"I want to develop his financial skills, ' Yan said.

Chen Jie, a 14-year-old girl from Ningbo, Zhejiang, received 3600 yuan as gift money during the Spring Festival. However, her grandmother took away all the money and put it in a bank account, a situation that many students experience as well. Xiong Shengyue, another 14-year-old from Nanjing, believes that the money should belong to the children, and they should have the responsibility to manage it. Chu Chaohui, a researcher at the National Institute of Education Sciences, explains that the traditional concept of gift money has evolved over time. It now serves to demonstrate social status and nurture relationships, distancing itself from the original symbolism of good will and having \\"little to do with the children.\\" Additionally, since children don't earn the money through work, Chu believes that parents should play a significant role in managing the funds. On the other hand, Yan Honglan, a mother of a 14-year-old boy in Beijing, has allowed her son to handle his gift money since he was 8 years old. Yan aims to develop her son's financial skills and emphasizes the importance of making children feel respected and trusted while dealing with their gift money. Chen Jie underscores Yan's perspective by noting that she would feel happier knowing how her money is being spent, which would also evoke a sense of maturity. In conclusion, managing gift money is a complex issue impacted by cultural and social factors. Parents, guardians, and educators have differing opinions on the matter, as evident from the beliefs of Xiong Shengyue, Chu Chaohui, and Yan Honglan.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is the blood entering the kidneys for filtration. Here is the revised and detailed step-by-step process of kidney function: 1. Blood Enters the Kidneys: The first step in the process is the delivery of blood to the kidneys for filtration. Blood from the body, containing waste and excess substances, is transported to the kidneys via renal arteries. The renal arteries branch off from the aorta, which is the body's main blood vessel, and are responsible for supplying the kidneys with oxygenated blood. 2. Waste Enters the Kidneys: As blood flows into the kidneys, it carries various waste products and excess substances that the body needs to eliminate in order to maintain a proper balance. 3. A Processing Moment in the Kidneys Lets Waste and Fluid Pass: Inside each kidney, there are about a million tiny filtration units known as nephrons. Each nephron is composed of a glomerulus and a tubule. As blood flows through the glomerulus, a network of tiny blood capillaries, the waste and excess substances in the blood are forced out of the bloodstream by hydrostatic pressure and into the tubule due to the small size of the capillaries and the surrounding walls of the Bowman's capsule. 4. Prevents Larger Molecules to Pass: The filtration process in the kidneys is selective and only allows certain substances to pass through. Larger molecules like proteins and blood cells are generally prevented from passing through the capillary walls into the tubule. These larger molecules remain in the bloodstream and are not subject to the filtration process. 5. Fluid Goes Back to the Bloodstream: As the fluid and waste products pass through the tubule, important nutrients, water, and electrolytes are selectively reabsorbed back into the bloodstream through the walls of the tubule. This process helps to maintain the body's hydration levels and overall balance of electrolytes. 6. Bad Waste is Removed: Once the vital components are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream, the remaining waste products and excess substances continue to flow through the tubules and are further processed and concentrated into a liquid waste called urine. 7. The Final Product is Turned into Urine: After the waste products have been processed and concentrated in the tubules, the final liquid waste, or urine, is transported from the kidneys to the urinary bladder via the ureters. From the bladder, the urine is then eliminated from the body through the urethra during urination. In summary, the missing first step in the process is the delivery of blood containing waste and excess substances to the kidneys for filtration. This initiates the kidney's crucial function of filtering and processing the body's waste, ensuring the body maintains proper balance and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea.

Let's break down each question to better understand the difference. 1. \\"What is the best thing about the company you work for?\\" This question aims to understand the specific aspects of the company that an individual currently works for. The focus is on the positive characteristics or benefits that the company offers. This question can be interpreted as asking about the company culture, employee benefits, opportunities for growth, or any other factors that make the company a great place to work in the perspective of the employee. It encourages the employee to reflect on their current experience at the company, highlighting a particular feature that they find most appealing or satisfactory. Possible answers to this question may include: - \\"The company culture is very supportive and encourages collaboration.\\" - \\"I love that the company offers excellent employee benefits, such as generous healthcare coverage and flexible working hours.\\" - \\"The company provides ample opportunities for professional growth and learning, keeping me motivated and engaged in my job.\\" 2. \\"What is the best company you have worked for?\\" This question focuses on the individual's work history and is asking them to compare their experiences at different companies. It requires the responder to consider their entire career and evaluate which organization stands out as the best one they have worked for in their perspective. The question does not imply that their current company is the best one; it's an open question that allows the respondent to consider all their previous employers. Possible answers to this question might be: - \\"The best company I've worked for is XYZ Corporation because of their amazing employee benefits and a supportive work environment.\\" - \\"Throughout my career, I enjoyed working for ABC Industries the most, as it offered great opportunities for growth and a rewarding professional experience.\\" In summary, the first question asks for the best thing about an individual's current company, prompting them to evaluate their experiences particular to that company. The second question, on the other hand, asks for the best company from the employee's entire work history, prompting a comparison between multiple employers. Both questions ultimately revolve around the positive experiences and aspects of a company, but they are distinctly different in terms of their focus and the type of evaluation they require from the individual responding."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What's the full name of the man who suggested the Chili Peppers record in Houdini's former mansion?, using the article: Now settled into Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said \\"There are definitely ghosts in the house,\\" and Frusciante felt they were \\"very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.\\"Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea each had their own rooms in the house.

I was pleasantly surprised with my recent stay at the Mirage and would gladly stay at this hotel again. LOVES: 1) LOCATION: Located on the strip, closer to the North end. As any of you regular Vegas goers know, location is everything! For this particular Vegas trip the majority of our plans had us at the North end of the strip which made it convenient for us to get around by foot or taxi. 2) FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA: I love love love the pretty (and huge) aquarium situated right behind the front desk. It runs the length of the front desk area, so as you're waiting in the long line to check in or check out at least you've got a lovely view of the pretty aquarium to keep you entertained. 3) ROOM RATES: I usually book MGM or the Gold Coast for Vegas trips because of their bargain rates, but when fellow Yelper Ingrid R told me about the good rates at the Mirage I checked it out. Our room rates for our stay were as follows: Fri 12/21 72 Sat 12/22 72 Sun 12/23 56 However, keep in mind as with any other hotel in Vegas the above room rates did not include the daily 25 resort fee nor the 12% room tax. So including all the fees and taxes the entire stay came to 309. 4) ROOMS: Although me and my boyfriend's room was all the way at the end of the hall, we scored a corner room that was slightly larger than our other friends' rooms and had better views because of the semi wraparound windows. My favorite part about the room was the abundance of mirrors they had, aside from the mirror in the bathroom. As soon as we walked in, I noticed a full length mirror to my left (absolute must have in any Vegas hotel room); the mirrored closet; and a rather large hanging mirror on the wall next to the bathroom door. Regardless of who was in the bathroom and how long the bathroom was in use, the mirrors came in handy for the other one to still get ready. Enough about the mirrors lol, the rest of the room was nice: simple modern decor; comfy bed; large flat screen tv; etc. Although the bathroom was pretty small compared to other hotels I've stayed at. 5) BLT: You'll have to read my BLT review for more details, but what a great find and soooooo convenient!!! Good food & awesome shakes!!! The group of us ended up eating here multiple times during our Vegas trip. Aside for the small bathroom in our room, there really isn't anything to dislike about the Mirage.

Choose from: a. yes b. it is not possible to tell c. no","completion":"Based on the premise, \\"but they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do that somewhere else,\\" it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis \\"They need to pay for the international debt too\\" is true. So, the correct answer is: b. it is not possible to tell Explanation: The premise provided is rather ambiguous, offering limited information about the context, the parties involved, the nature of \\"it\\" they need to pay for, and the relationship between the obligation to pay for \\"it\\" and the inability to do so elsewhere. Without a clear understanding of these key aspects, it is not possible to determine if the hypothesis regarding international debt obligations is accurate or relevant. For example, the term \\"international debt\\" usually refers to the money owed by one country to another, typically in the form of government bonds, financial instruments, or loans from international financial institutions such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. However, the wording of the premise does not provide any indication that the parties involved are countries or governments, which makes drawing a connection to international debt uncertain. Moreover, the phrase \\"they couldn't do that somewhere else\\" implies that there may be unique circumstances or reasons why the obligation to pay for \\"it\\" is necessary, but the lack of specificity about what \\"it\\" represents or what those circumstances are further complicates the matter. For instance, \\"it\\" could refer to a specific service, resource, or asset, which may or may not have a relationship to international debt. On the other hand, the word \\"too\\" in the hypothesis could be interpreted as confirming that there are additional obligations or responsibilities aside from those noted in the premise. However, the absence of context regarding the obligations discussed in the premise prevents us from conclusively determining whether the international debt hypothesis fits within that framework. In summary, because of the ambiguities and missing information present in the premise, it is not possible to ascertain the truthfulness of the hypothesis concerning international debt obligations. More information would be needed to offer a more definitive answer on the matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Steroid hormones are made of lipids, such as phospholipids and cholesterol. Fact 2: Fats are known as lipids. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What are steroid hormones made of?\\" with the following options: - bacteria - fats - sugar - muscle - H 2 O - sunlight - the Sun - SO2 A:","completion":"Given Fact 1 and Fact 2 provided, steroid hormones are made of lipids, such as phospholipids and cholesterol, and fats are known as lipids. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"What are steroid hormones made of?\\" is - fats. Steroid hormones are a class of hormones that are derived from cholesterol and are essential for several vital functions in the body, such as regulating metabolism, inflammation, immune function, salt and water balance, and development of sexual characteristics. These hormones are synthesized primarily in the adrenal glands and the gonads (i.e., ovaries and testes). Some examples of steroid hormones include cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone, and estrogen. Cholesterol acts as the starting material for the synthesis of steroid hormones. Enzymes in the cells of the adrenal and gonadal glands modify the cholesterol molecule to produce different steroid hormones, each with specific biological functions. While cholesterol is a type of lipid, it is essential to note that not all lipids are cholesterol. Lipids are a broad class of organic molecules that include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and cholesterol. They are all characterized by being insoluble in water and soluble in organic solvents like ether, chloroform, and acetone. Lipids are an essential component in living organisms, providing energy storage, cellular signaling, and maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes.

What is the difference between scripting language, programming language and network protocol? Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick your answer from: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"(A). No. These questions do not have the same meaning. Although they are related to the fields of programming and computer systems, they tackle different areas and concepts. Let me explain the differences between the terms mentioned in the questions. 1. Difference between a programming language and a scripting language: A programming language is a formal language that provides a set of instructions that a computer can understand and use to execute specific tasks. It consists of various components such as syntax, semantics, and pragmatics which allow developers to define, structure, and produce various types of software applications. Examples of programming languages are C, C++, Java, and Python. A scripting language, on the other hand, is a specific type of programming language often used for automating tasks, modifying data, or processing text within software applications. Scripting languages are typically interpreted rather than compiled. This means that the code doesn't need to be translated into lower-level code before executing, which makes it generally easier and quicker to write and modify. Some examples of scripting languages are JavaScript, Perl, and Ruby. While both programming languages and scripting languages are types of languages designed for controlling computer systems, they have different use cases, execution methods, and complexity. 2. Difference between a scripting language, programming language, and network protocol: As mentioned earlier, a scripting language is a type of programming language used for automating tasks and processing data within software applications. A network protocol, on the other hand, is a set of rules and conventions that allow computers to communicate with each other over a network. These rules define the format, data transmission, and error correction methodologies to ensure reliable and efficient communication between devices. Examples of network protocols include HTTP, FTP, and TCP/IP. Thus, coding with a scripting or programming language helps to create software applications, while network protocols facilitate communication between those applications over networks. To summarize, the questions address distinct but related concepts: - The first question asks about the difference between programming languages and scripting languages. - The second question asks about the differences between scripting languages, programming languages, and network protocols. These are different questions, and their meanings are not the same; therefore, the correct answer is (A).

Since the original question asks for the day of the week, an appropriate answer would mention a particular weekday that the city council meets. It is important to note that the meeting schedule for city councils can vary greatly depending on the city or municipality in question. Therefore, gathering accurate information by visiting the city or municipality's official website or contacting their administrative offices might be necessary. For example, a good answer could be: \\"The city council meets every second and fourth Tuesday of each month at 7:00 PM.\\" In this answer, not only is the day of the week provided (Tuesday), but it also specifies the frequency of the meetings (every second and fourth Tuesday of each month) and the time at which they take place (7:00 PM).

Choices: - the lungs - the heart - the kidneys - the brain stem A: A:","completion":"The brain stem monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. The respiratory centers are located within the medulla oblongata and the pons, which are part of the brain stem. These centers are responsible for controlling the rate and depth of breathing by monitoring levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and hydrogen ions in the blood. The process of monitoring carbon dioxide levels in the blood is essential for maintaining proper acid-base balance within the body and ensuring efficient gas exchange in the lungs. The body continuously produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct of cellular respiration. Consequently, the blood transports carbon dioxide away from the cells and towards the lungs, where it is removed from the body during exhalation. Chemoreceptors, specialized sensory receptors within the medullary respiratory centers, as well as peripheral chemoreceptors in the aortic and carotid bodies, are responsible for detecting changes in blood carbon dioxide levels. When levels of carbon dioxide rise above a specific threshold, these receptors send signals to the respiratory centers, which then initiate a response to increase the rate and depth of breathing. This allows for the removal of excess carbon dioxide, restoring the levels to within the normal range. If, on the other hand, the levels of carbon dioxide are low, the respiratory centers receive the opposite signal from chemoreceptors, leading to decreased respiration rate, shallow breathing, or, eventually, temporary cessation of breathing known as apnea. This allows the level of carbon dioxide in the blood to return to a normal range, maintaining balance. In summary, the brain stem, particularly the medulla oblongata and the pons, monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. Chemoreceptors within the respiratory centers, as well as peripheral chemoreceptors, detect changes in carbon dioxide levels and relay this information to the brain stem. In response, the brain stem adjusts the rate and depth of breathing to maintain blood carbon dioxide levels within a proper range, ensuring overall acid-base balance and efficient gas exchange within the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here, it is said that \\"Now the former Nathan's Folly is known as the Golden Mile.\\" From this sentence alone, several key pieces of information can be gleaned. First, the use of the word \\"Now\\" indicates a change in time, suggesting that a situation has shifted and is no longer the same. This tells us that a shift has occurred at some point between the past and the present. Second, the reference to \\"the former Nathan's Folly\\" reveals that Nathan's Folly is no longer the name used to describe this particular location, and that it has become something else instead. This suggests a transformation or renaming has taken place. Lastly, the name \\"Golden Mile\\" is stated as the new moniker for this location, meaning that it has replaced the title \\"Nathan's Folly.\\" Putting these pieces of information together—namely, the reference to a change in time, the indication that Nathan's Folly is no longer the current name for this location, and the introduction of Golden Mile as the replacement name—it is possible to make the conclusion that \\"The Golden Mile was previously called the Nathan's Folly.\\" This conclusion supports the idea that at some point in the past, the area currently known as the Golden Mile was recognized as Nathan's Folly. Over time, as the circumstances changed and the area transformed, it has taken on a new name: the Golden Mile. As such, the Golden Mile indeed succeeded Nathan's Folly, and the conclusion can be drawn that \\"The Golden Mile was previously called the Nathan's Folly.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again. She told me that if the T-shirt relay was an Olympic event, her team would win the gold medal. I told her that in my professional opinion, she was absolutely right.

After Moon's assistant Zao discovers that Bond is a British agent, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a hovercraft chase ensues, which ends with Moon's apparent death. Bond survives, but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon. After 14 months of captivity and torture, Bond is traded for Zao in a prisoner exchange. He is sedated and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent is suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress. Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government and decides to avenge his betrayal. After escaping from the custody of MI6, he discovers that he is in Hong Kong, where he learns from a Chinese agent that Zao is in Cuba. In Havana Bond meets NSA agent Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson and follows her to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and attempts to kill him, but Zao escapes.

Q: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. The WHO says processed meats such as bacon, sausages and ham increase the risk of getting cancer. Dr Ian Johnson, from the Institute of Food Research, a publicly funded UK research institute that focuses on the science of food and health He reacted cautiously to the WHO's report, saying: \\"It is important to emphasise that this classification reflects the strength of the evidence for an effect, not the actual size of the risk. \\"Meat consumption is probably one of many factors contributing to the high rates of bowel cancer seen in America, Western Europe and Australia, but the mechanism is poorly understood, and the effect is much smaller than, for example, that of cigarette smoking on the risk of lung cancer. \\"It is also worth noting that there is little or no evidence that vegetarians in the UK have a lower risk of bowel cancer than meat-eaters.\\" Maureen Strong, of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, which is funded by farmers and growers to supply the food industry with information She said the WHO's report did not suggest eating red and processed meats \\"as part of a balanced diet\\" caused cancer. \\"No single food causes cancer. [The WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer] itself has said that the risk from processed meat remains small,\\" she said. Ms Strong added that the average daily consumption of processed meat was 17 grams, which meant that on average people would need to eat \\"three times their current levels to increase their risk\\" of developing cancer. Dr Louis Levy, of government health organisation Public Health England He said findings in the report were \\"broadly in line with current government advice\\", which is based on the possible link between consuming red and processed meat and colorectal cancer. \\"On average, we should be eating no more than 70g a day. This advice recognises the fact that red meat is also a good source of nutrients, including iron, zinc and vitamin B12.\\" Professor Tim Key, from Cancer Research UK He said there was \\"substantial evidence\\" for a link between meat-eating and bowel cancer. However, \\"Eating a bacon bap every once in a while isn't going to do much harm - having a healthy diet is all about moderation,\\" he said. \\"You could try having fish for your dinner rather than sausages, or choosing to have a bean salad for lunch over a BLT.\\" Meurig Raymond, president of the National Farmers Union (NFU) Mr Raymond said: \\"The NFU has always stated that eating lean red meat has an important role to play in a healthy balanced diet. It's a traditional part of the British lifestyle and is enjoyed by most of the population. He added that there was a \\"complex relationship\\" between diet and good health, and the solutions to any link between diet and illness \\"cannot be polarised or simplistic\\". \\"The scientific and medical communities both agree that consuming recommended quantities of red meat is beneficial to human health and provides the body with a ready source of essential vitamins and minerals,\\" he said. Clare Oxborrow, from environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth She welcomed the report, and said: \\"This should be a wake-up call that our diets urgently need to change. \\"Evidence shows that high meat diets not only harm our health; they damage our environment too. Experts have warned that unless we eat less meat globally, we will fail to meet our climate change targets.\\" Chris Godfrey, from Godfrey's Butchers in Highbury, north London, which has been selling sausages for more than 100 years Mr Godfrey said he was not concerned by the WHO's report as it is not telling people to avoid eating meat altogether. \\"They're not saying that meat's bad for you.

It is one of the world's most successful companies built on it's famous motto 'Don't be evil'. But a report by Business Insider says rather than peace and love, Google is filled with fierce relationships that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones. Behind the modern glass doors of the internet giant's California headquarters are complex stories of sex and intrigue. One member of staff told Business Insider: 'Inside Google, it's a Game of Thrones.' A report suggests Google is filled with sex scandal and political intrigue that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones, starring Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister. Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, where insiders say bosses are trying to clamp down on in-fighting. Former staff told the website that the politicking that goes on behind the scenes is reminiscent of the secret networking in the famous book and television series. According to sources quoted by Business Insider, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin actively encouraged loud and angry debate among their subordinates. But divisions within the company's various strands have now reportedly become so deep, that bosses are now trying to stamp out the in-fighting that was once so encouraged. Business Insider said that during a conference in Napa Valley in February, Page told senior executives that the warring had to stop and there would be 'zero tolerance for fighting.' The alleged change in stance comes after rumoured rivalries between the likes of former search and product executive Marissa Mayer, who is now CEO of Yahoo, and Salar Kamangar, CEO if YouTube. It was not only the networking and politicking that has been likened to Game of Thrones, in which mythical aristocracy and royalty battle for the crown. One member of staff said: 'Inside Google, it's a Game of Thrones'. Pictured: Court meddlers Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish (right) and Varys (left) Google co-founder Sergey Brin was involved in a recent sex scandal after it emerged he was dating Google worker Amanda Rosenberg. The book and series' sex and dangerous liaisons also has similarities to life at Google, according to insiders. The. most famous recent 'scandal' involved married Google co-founder Sergey. Brin who, it emerged last month, had an affair with Google Glass. employee Amanda Rosenberg. She had also previously dated Google executive Hugo Barra, according to reports. Although Google has a written code of conduct involving relationships with colleagues, staff say bosses mostly turn a blind eye. The internet giant's code states: 'If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved. ‘When faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: Would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm Google? Google co-founders Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page, actively encouraged fierce debate among staff, according to the report. ‘Would this activity embarrass Google or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog? If the answer to any of these questions is “yes”, the relationship or situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it.’ However, as Business Insider states, in Douglas Edwards' book about the launch of the company 'I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions Of Google Employee Number 59' relationships with co-workers were common. Mr Edwards quotes HR worker Heather Cairns as saying: 'hormones were flying and not everyone remembered to lock their doors.' But as one Google worker told Business Insider: 'In a place like Google, which has strong technical talent as well as business talent, it's very natural that people are going to be attracted to one another.' Google did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.","completion":"This article says that Google is a very famous and successful company.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. 12 Dead in NYC Legionnaires’ Disease Outbreak City and state workers have tested dozens of cooling towers for Legionnaires’ disease in the Bronx, a painstaking process augmented over the weekend by six staffers and three vehicles from Westchester County. The workers got along well, said Caren Halbfinger of the county health department. “These are all professionals who are used to responding to emergencies,” she said. But at each cooling tower, they took two samples, she said: one for the city and one for the state. Differing city and state responses to the outbreak were on display Monday as Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats, spoke at separate, simultaneous news conferences, where each touted his administration’s response to the outbreak but declined to comment on the other’s. Two more people died from Legionnaires’ disease, officials said Monday, and additional sites tested positive for the bacterium that causes the disease. The death count is now 12, up from 10 this weekend, and the total number of cases is 113. Mr. de Blasio said two more sites tested positive for the bacterium, while Mr. Cuomo identified three, which he said were outside the “impact area that was initially tested.” At the end of the day, the state and city said 18 sites tested positive for the bacterium, both in and outside the impact zone. The city had sent 46,600 robocalls to households, Mr. de Blasio said. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo on Monday said that the state had canvassed more than 500 buildings and people Sunday and 1,500 Monday. State workers also distributed a state-produced flier with facts about the disease—distinct from the flier that city health department workers had distributed earlier. Mr. de Blasio declined to comment on the state’s response to the outbreak. Mr. Cuomo, answering questions after a criminal justice-related news conference, declined to comment on the city’s. “I am not in a position to comment on what the city has done,” he said. Both agreed that cooling towers, which have been blamed for the outbreak, should be regulated, and both had different plans to do so. Mr. de Blasio pushed City Council legislation, which he said would pass Thursday. “The City of New York obviously takes responsibility for our own people,” he said. “We’re going to pass the rules and laws we need to pass.” He added: “We’re not sure when Albany is going to treat the matter.” Mr. Cuomo said the state would regulate the buildings and that such regulation wouldn’t require legislative approval. Asked how his approach would differ from the city’s, he said, “I don’t know what the city’s protocol is, so I don’t know how it would be different.” The mayor and governor’s offices had a fight Friday night after remarks that an aide to the mayor made questioning the state’s response to Legionnaire’s disease, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Cuomo was upset and made it known to the mayor’s office, these people said. Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. issued his own statement, which noted that he proposed legislation last month. “When it became clear that such outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease could be prevented through regular inspections, I proposed that the City Council move to create such legislation as quickly as possible,” he said. Meanwhile, those in the Bronx said there remained continual worry about the disease and the official response. “If this was the Upper East Side, this wouldn’t be an issue,” said Ed Garcia Conde, a local activist and blogger. A spokeswoman for City Councilwoman Vanessa Gibson, who represents affected Bronx neighborhoods, said she was concerned that differing numbers and information could cause wider worry among residents. Teams from both the state and city tested cooling towers in the Bronx over the weekend. Thirty-nine buildings in the affected area of the South Bronx have a cooling tower of the type associated with this outbreak, city officials said. Mr. Cuomo said Sunday that the state that day would test 62 buildings at the city’s request. Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio said they were collaborating on the testing. City officials had targeted the Opera House Hotel as a likely place where the disease originated, a senior official said. Tests were due back later this week, the official said. Of the 12 who have died of the disease, 11 were older adults with existing conditions, while one person was under 40. The last day someone became sick with Legionnaires’ was Aug. 3, which shows the outbreak continues to taper off, Mr. de Blasio said. City and state officials Monday identified 11 sites that tested positive for the bacteria in what they are now calling the impact zone: Concourse Plaza, the Opera House Hotel, Lincoln Medical Center, Streamline Plastics Co., two courthouses, a Verizon building, a nursing home, a post office, a Department of Homeless Services intake center and a high school. An additional four buildings are outside of this zone: another Verizon building, a police department, and buildings at 1201 Lafayette Ave. and 230 East 123rd St. —Erica Orden contributed to this article.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Monumental Hubris - Forbes.com History has a funny way of humbling men. So do markets. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Lehman Brothers' (nyse: LEH - news - people ) fall is that it comes almost seven years to the day after 9/11. That day was supposed to teach us humility. The fall of Lehman, coming six months after the collapse of Bear Stearns and coupled with Merrill Lynch's (nyse: MER - news - people ) disappearance as an independent company, are the result of a complete lack of humility on the part of those executives charged with leading the world's most important purveyors of capital in the post-9/11 world. For all the talk of pulling together in the wake of the terrorist attacks that shook America to the core and that supposedly set our priorities straight, Wall Street rushed headlong back to its mindless pursuit of profits and speculation without consideration for the consequences of its actions. Now, the chickens have come home to roost. In April 2008, our firm, Hegemony Capital Management, published a controversial essay entitled \\"How to Fix It,\\" in which we outlined our (unsolicited) recommendations for how to correct the excesses that led to the credit crisis that began in mid-2007 and brought us to these historic days. Special Offer: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hit the skids! Merrill gets sold, Lehman goes under. Blood is certainly in the streets. What are you buying? Click here for a free trial of Forbes-Lehmann Income Securities Investor with new recommended buys of bank preferred stocks offering double-digit yields. Our key recommendations, which seemed much more radical in April than they do today, were the following: --Improve financial industry regulation and replace substance over form in the regulation we have. --Place absolute leverage limitations on financial institutions at much lower levels than the 30:1 levels that led to this crisis. --Place an absolute limitation on hedge fund leverage. --Regulate Wall Street compensation by basing it on multiple years' performance, adding claw-backs and high-water marks and limit cash compensation that weakens these firms' balance sheets. --Tax private equity firms' carried interests at ordinary interest rates rather than capital gains rates and restrict private equity firms' ability to go public. --Re-institute the uptick rule with respect to short selling. Finally, we made the point that too much economic activity in the U.S. was aimed at speculation rather than production. For example, the equity markets are increasingly dominated by quantitative investment strategies that are driven by considerations that are totally divorced from considerations of fundamental value. At the same time, the credit markets are increasingly utilized to finance change-of-control transactions for private equity firms that are done simply because low-cost financing is available, not because a project is going to add to the productive capacity or capital account of the nation. As we wrote in that April issue, \\"At some point, society has to figure out that the way an investor earns his money is even more important than the amount of money he makes. This is why human beings were vested with moral sentiments, so they could distinguish the quality of human conduct from the quantity of its results.\\" These changes cannot and will not be effected simply by legislative fiat. It is incumbent upon the gatekeepers of capital, the fiduciaries that make the decisions about allocating capital, to bring discipline to the system. This will require a rethinking of their priorities and a willingness to add to their investment calculus considerations that exceed their own narrow interests about short-term investment returns. Special Offer: Low-risk time to buy stocks? Click here for a free trial of InvesTech Research with veteran money manager Jim Stack's latest outlook and portfolio moves. Our system requires a new concept of fiduciary duty that encompasses systemic as well as single-firm interests, and that focuses to a greater degree on risk-adjusted returns than raw numerical returns. Obviously the forces that led to current events have been building for many years, and the changes needed to fix the system will not be made overnight, but we should not let this occasion pass to reflect on what has occurred. It is clear to us that the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury are not underestimating the enormity of the crisis. AIG (nyse: AIG - news - people ) is a much larger systemic threat than Lehman Brothers ever was, so this situation is profoundly serious. In our judgment, investors should not try to pick a bottom in today's or this week's market. The market is going to experience extraordinary volatility in the immediate future. Play the market at your own risk and only with money you can afford to lose. The indexes are heading significantly lower, as we have previously forecast. Gold, short-term U.S. Treasuries, short-term Swiss and German government paper, the Swiss franc and certain Asian currencies like the Singapore dollar are the safest places to park your cash for the moment. The U.S. dollar continues to be debased (less against the euro, which remains compromised, than against Asian currencies and the Swiss franc), particularly by the startling and historic decision by the Federal Reserve to accept equity securities at its discount window. If nothing else, that decision alone suggests the enormity and depth of the crisis we are facing. We never thought we'd live to see the day that the American central bank would accept equity as collateral for loans. We have to admit that took us by surprise and made us very nervous. Michael E.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

No Answer:","completion":"(2). No Step 1: Understand the question The question asks if the answer \\"reproduction\\" is the right term for what sense of smell impacts in an animal, given that it impacts their survival. Step 2: Evaluate the relationship between survival and reproduction Survival and reproduction are both essential aspects of an animal's life. While survival ensures the animal's ability to live, reproduction ensures the continuity of its species. Step 3: Determine the role of sense of smell in survival and reproduction The sense of smell in animals plays a significant role in their survival, as it helps them find food, avoid predators, and locate mates. This supports the notion that the sense of smell impacts an animal's survival. However, it is important to recognize that the sense of smell also impacts an animal's reproduction. Animals rely on their sense of smell to locate and identify suitable mates, which is crucial for successful reproduction. Step 4: Provide the justification for the answer Although sense of smell does impact an animal's survival, it is not accurate to say that the right answer to the question is \\"reproduction\\".

(CNN) -- Interim Egyptian President Adly Mansour sent a letter to the family of jailed Al Jazeera journalist Mohamed Fahmy on Sunday telling him that Fahmy \\"will enjoy all his rights guaranteed by Egyptian law.\\" Mansour also ordered Egypt's interior minister to follow up on Fahmy's health condition and \\"to provide all possible care.\\" Fahmy, a former CNN producer, injured his shoulder before his arrest in December while working as bureau chief for Al Jazeera English in Cairo. He's complained about not getting proper medical treatment while in prison. He says that because of the lack of treatment, he no longer has full use of his right arm. He said he and his colleagues -- Al Jazeera correspondent","completion":"Peter Greste and producer Baher Mohamed -- are being targeted not for any crime, but because they were \\"just doing their jobs\\" as journalists, reporting on various stories in Egypt to keep the public informed. Fahmy vehemently maintains that his unyielding commitment to truthful and objective reporting stands as testament to the fact that the charges against him and his fellow journalists are unfounded. He, Greste and Mohamed are facing charges of promoting false news in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt declared a terrorist organization after President Mohamed Morsi's ouster. All three have denied the accusations, insisting that their work was solely focused on providing accurate and unbiased information to their viewers. Al Jazeera has also vehemently denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges baseless and unjust, and has been working tirelessly to secure the release of their reporters. Their trial has drawn sharp criticism from the international community, who argue that the case is just another example of the Egyptian government attempting to stifle press freedom and crack down on dissent in the country. The United Nations, the European Union, and other global organizations have all expressed concern over the condition of press freedom in Egypt, urging the government to drop the charges and release Fahmy, Greste, and Mohamed. Despite the ongoing pressure, the Egyptian government has remained steadfast in their pursuit of the case. Fahmy and his colleagues have spent over 400 days behind bars, as their legal battle continues to unfold. The case has been marked by numerous adjournments, causing further frustration to their friends and families who are eager to see them released. Fahmy's health remains a significant concern, as the deteriorating condition of his shoulder is a constant reminder of the inadequate medical care he has received while in prison. Human rights groups and medical professionals have advocated for Fahmy to receive proper treatment, emphasizing the irreversible consequences of such neglect. As he and his fellow journalists continue to fight for their freedom, their case serves as a stark reminder of the erosion of press freedom in certain parts of the world. The global community of journalists and press freedom advocates remain committed to their cause, hopeful that one day they will be released and reunited with their loved ones, and that this dark chapter in Egypt's history will come to an end. The unwavering support and solidarity from around the world for Fahmy, Greste, and Mohamed demonstrate the vital importance of a free and independent press in maintaining a just and democratic society."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A honeytrapper and her boyfriend lured a man to a park over Facebook so they could attack him with a meat cleaver for his money and mobile phone. Haseena Aziz arranged to go on the 'date' in order to give her 29-year-old boyfriend Afahan Hussain a chance to rob the victim. The 28-year-old tempted the man to meet her in a park in Birmingham by flirting with him in a series of messages over the social-networking site. Haseena Aziz, 28, pictured left, arranged to go on a 'date' with a man in Birmingham so she and her boyfriend Afahan Hussain, 29, pictured right, could threaten him with a meat cleaver and rob him. The unnamed 25-year-old victim caught a train to Birmingham from his home in London in June this year in the belief Aziz wanted to start a relationship with him. He took a seat on a bench in parkland near a fly-over in Hockley, Birmingham, expecting to meet Aziz for a date. Instead, Hussain - who has a gold tooth - appeared from behind and punched and headbutted the defenceless victim. He then held a meat cleaver to his face and demanded his phone and cash. The court heard how Aziz laughed as she watched the attack and even waded in by kicking the man in the groin. The pair later sent texts to the victim mocking him for falling for their set-up. West Midlands Police launched an investigation. The pair were found through phone and social media enquiries. They were charged with robbery and both found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court. The pair - who later sent texts to the victim mocking him for falling for their set-up - were convicted at Birmingham Crown Court of robbery. Recorder Oscar Del Fabbro. jailed Hussain for a total of 12 years after he was found. guilty of the robbery, as well as a separate crime of wounding with intent to cause GBH. Aziz was also found guilty of robbery and was sentenced to four years in prison. The court heard how, weeks after the park attack, Hussain also slashed a complete stranger across the face with a Stanley knife during an unprovoked street attack. He shoulder-barged a 27-year-old man to the floor in the early hours of August 7. As the victim scrambled to his feet, Hussain then pulled out a knife and slashed him down the left side of his face severing an artery and narrowly missing his left eye. Unemployed Hussain denied the offence but the victim's recollection of his attacker's distinctive gold tooth was crucial in the conviction. Speaking about the second attack Detective Constable Sara Caldwell, from West Midlands Police, said: 'It was completely unprovoked. The man was walking with a friend to a local shop to buy cigarettes when Hussain deliberately barged into him and lashed out with a knife. 'The victim suffered significant blood loss, nerve damage and has lost sensation on the left side of his face. It was an outrageous attack. 'Anyone who carries a knife in public is potentially putting themselves and others in danger and can expect to be jailed, even if they don't strike out with it in anger. 'The judge described Hussain as a dangerous man and a risk to the public.He will rightly spend many years behind bars and be subject to an extended licence period upon his eventual release.'","completion":"A lady named Haseena and her boyfriend, Afahan, did something very mean to a man they met on Facebook.

Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson took to Twitter over the weekend to offer several \\"Mysteries of #Gravity,\\" including \\"The film #Gravity should be renamed 'Angular Momentum.' \\" He points what the film got wrong, from the fact that Bullock's hair didn't free float to why she, as a medical doctor, was on the mission to start with. So here we offer 5 things that couldn't happen in \\"Gravity.\\" Word to the wise: Stop reading now if you have an issue with spoilers (Seriously. You have been warned). 1. The way the shuttle travels NASA expert Michael A. Interbartolo III didn't even have to wait for the film to come out to dispute this. When the trailer premiered, he wrote that the relative motion of the shuttle in the film appears to be off for the chain of events that follow. \\"The way I am seeing it, the shuttle was wings level, payload bay up (Z), right wing into the orbital velocity vector (X direction of travel), nose in Y,\\" wrote Interbartolo, who said he flew the shuttle in Mission Control for 11 years. \\"The Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris [MMOD] (though most were not really micro Meteoroid) impact puts it into a roll about Y with it still traveling in the velocity vector X, and why are the Forward and Aft reaction control jets not firing to damp the ramp since they were intact in the trailer?\\" Translation for you non-science types out there: It's more movie magic than actual science that has the shuttle getting smacked with debris and then heading in the direction it is set. Sandra Bullock keeps defying gravity with her career 2. Rendezvousing in space is not as easy -- or as quick -- as the film makes it appear Bullock plays Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first mission in space who gets set adrift after an accident. Part of the action involves her trying to make her way back to a fellow astronaut, Clooney's Matt Kowalski. But according to Interbartolo, it's a wonder that Clooney's character doesn't get \\"shredded\\" by all the debris floating around after the incident, let alone that the pair manage to link up again. \\"If it is just her and Clooney, assuming she somehow got back to him after being flung away on the (Remote Manipulator System) free floating trying to get to the space station without a vehicle, that seems unlikely, unless the two orbits just magically intersect at the exact right time for them to be anywhere near the (International Space Station),\\" he said. What Buzz Aldrin thinks of 'Gravity' 3. Kowalski's equipment is outdated Kowalski flies around on a way-cool jet pack that helps him get to Stone when she is in need. Writing for WRAL's science blog, NASA/JPL Solar System Ambassador program volunteer Tony Rice notes that \\"The Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) Clooney's character jets around on in the opening scenes does exist but was used only on three early shuttle missions and not since 1984. \\"You can see space flown MMUs today hanging above space-flown shuttle orbiters at the Air and Space Museum and Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex,\\" Rice wrote. \\"The MMU was capable only of short bursts to move astronauts around the shuttle, not crossing distances portrayed in the film and certainly not in the time presented. But it was certainly a cool way to get Bullock and Clooney into the second act.\\" Read this story or we give away the ending 4. Bullock's astronaut is way more adept than she should be After all the space walking, being flung around and dodging debris, Bullock's Stone is still able to navigate not just one but two spacecraft from other countries: a Russian Soyuz and a Chinese Shenzhou. It's amazing, given that Stone points out that she was not the best in training on the United States spacecraft. \\"She handles both ships with surprising deftness considering she was only lightly trained on the Soyuz and not at all on the Shenzhou,\\" Jeffrey Kluger wrote for Time magazine. \\"And throughout the movie, she and Clooney spend a fair bit of time getting whacked around in space, grabbing onto this or that rail or tether on the shuttle or ISS only at the last second to avoid pinwheeling off into the void. In truth, pressurized space gloves are murderously hard to manipulate, providing only limited grip at best and leaving astronauts' hands cold and very painful after a day of work. Making the kinds of one-handed Cirque du Soleil catches Clooney and Bullock accomplish would be impossible.\\" How Bullock prepared for her role 5. The Hubble, the International Space Station and a Chinese space station are not neighbors In the film, Bullock just needs to hop from space station to space station in order to find a refuge from debris and to make it home to Earth. But as the New York Times pointed out, that's not as easy as it looks. Photos: Sandra Bullock: America's sweetheart \\"As we recall from bitter memory, the Hubble and the space station are in vastly different orbits,\\" Dennis Overbye wrote. \\"Getting from one to the other requires so much energy that not even space shuttles had enough fuel to do it. The telescope is 353 miles high, in an orbit that keeps it near the Equator; the space station is about 100 miles lower, in an orbit that takes it far north, over Russia.\\" \\"To have the movie astronauts Matt Kowalski (Mr. Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Ms. Bullock) zip over to the space station would be like having a pirate tossed overboard in the Caribbean swim to London.\\" The film's director, Alfonso Cuarón, seemed fully prepared for the criticism after \\"Gravity's\\" release. \\"This is not a documentary,\\" the director told collectSPACE.com. \\"It is a piece of fiction.\\"","completion":"In the movie \\"Gravity,\\" starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, there are some issues regarding the portrayal of scientific facts. Some of the inaccuracies the film presents include: 1. The way the shuttle travels: The shuttle's movements in the film have been deemed unrealistic by NASA expert Michael A. Interbartolo III, who claims that the way the shuttle gets impacted by debris and heads in a particular direction is more movie magic than actual science. 2. Rendezvousing in space: In the movie, Bullock's character attempts to make her way back to Clooney's character. However, Interbartolo points out the improbability of this scenario, especially considering the debris floating around and the difficulty of two orbits intersecting at the right moment. 3. Kowalski's (Clooney's character) equipment is outdated: Kowalski uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) to fly around. However, this type of equipment was only used on three early shuttle missions and has not been used since 1984. 4. Bullock's astronaut is more adept than she should be: Despite her character admitting to struggling in training, Bullock's Ryan Stone is portrayed as being able to efficiently navigate two spacecraft from other countries. 5. The distance between space stations: In the film, Bullock's character hops from one space station to another. In reality, the Hubble, the International Space Station, and a Chinese space station are not close neighbors, making this an unrealistic scenario. Despite these inaccuracies, it is important to remember that \\"Gravity\\" is a work of fiction, not a documentary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - kitchen - plate - dinning - stomach - pantry I believe the correct choice is \\"plate\\", here's why: A:","completion":"Indeed, the correct choice is \\"plate.\\" When we consider the process of preparing and consuming food, there are several stages involved, including purchasing, storing, preparing, and serving. The last place food is typically found before being eaten is on a plate or other serving dish. Here's a brief overview of the stages mentioned and how they relate to the given options: 1. Pantry: This is where food is stored prior to being prepared. Pantries typically house dry goods, canned goods, and other non-perishable food items. Refrigerators and freezers play a similar role for perishables. 2. Kitchen: This is where food is prepared for consumption, usually by cooking, baking, or otherwise assembling ingredients. The kitchen is equipped with appliances, utensils, and cookware to help create various dishes. 3. Dining: This refers to the act of eating food, whether at a dining table, a restaurant, or elsewhere. This stage comes after food has been served on a plate. 4. Plate: This is the final stage where food is presented, portioned, and consumed. Plates, bowls, and other serving dishes hold the food so that it can be eaten with utensils or by hand. 5. Stomach: This is not a place where food is found before being eaten, but rather the first destination during the digestion process after the food has been consumed. In summary, the last place food is before being eaten is on a plate, where it is typically presented and portioned before consumption. The plate serves as the final stage between food preparation in the kitchen and the act of dining, during which the food is consumed and later digested in the stomach."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Math Problem Solve -646*g - 831*g = -458*g + 1383*g + 33628 for g.","completion":"To solve the equation -646*g - 831*g = -458*g + 1383*g + 33628 for g, we have to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left-hand side (LHS), we have two terms containing g: -646g and -831g. Let's combine these terms: LHS = (-646 - 831) * g = -1477 * g = -1477g On the right-hand side (RHS), we have two terms containing g, -458g and 1383g. Let's combine these terms too: RHS =(-458 + 1383) * g + 33628 = 925 * g + 33628 = 925g + 33628 Now, the given equation becomes: -1477g = 925g + 33628 Step 2: Move all terms containing g to one side of the equation. To isolate g, we will move the 925g term from RHS to LHS by subtracting 925g from both sides of the equation: -1477g - 925g = 33628 Combine the terms containing g on the LHS: (-1477 - 925) * g = -2402 * g = -2402g Now, the equation becomes: -2402g = 33628 Step 3: Solve for g by dividing both sides by the coefficient of g, which is -2402. g = 33628 / -2402 g ≈ -14 So the solution to the equation -646*g - 831*g = -458*g + 1383*g + 33628 for g is g ≈ -14."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He found it's better to compare them if he needs to learn more about their characteristics. To make things easier, he labeled the weather of his city as char A. Then he labeled the climate of this city as char B. Once finished with learning their characteristics, Rob focused on climate change issues. For that, he labeled the climate of present time as char C and climate just before industrial revolution as char D. But I can use this background: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming.

Premise: \\"A pleasant way to enjoy the lake is to take a trip on the Victorian steamer Gondola.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The Gondolas on the lakes are powered by petroleum.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"The Gondolas on the lakes are powered by petroleum\\" is true. The premise states that the vehicle in question is a \\"Victorian steamer Gondola,\\" implying that the Gondola is an older, Victorian-era vessel powered by steam, not petroleum. While it is possible that some Gondolas on lakes are powered by petroleum, the specific Gondola mentioned in the premise is not. The Victorian era (1837 - 1901) was a period of great innovation and change in terms of transportation technology. While steam power was the dominant form of energy for vehicles on land and water, the use of petroleum (and its derivatives for powering engines) was still in its early stages. Steam-powered engines generally relied on the combustion of coal or wood to heat water and generate steam, which would then drive the engine's pistons, generating the motion necessary to propel the vehicle. The Gondola mentioned in the premise is a Victorian steamer or a steam-powered vessel from this era, possibly designed with a paddlewheel propulsion system and a steam engine. This style of Gondola lacks any reference to using petroleum as a power source, which is a more contemporary approach to fueling engines. Additionally, utilizing petroleum as a fuel source would not have been representative of the Victorian period Gondola and could potentially disregard the historical accuracy and the authentic experience that the vessel may provide to passengers. In summary, based solely on the premise given, we cannot support the hypothesis that the Gondolas on the lakes are powered by petroleum. The Victorian steamer Gondola, as described, would likely be powered by steam rather than petroleum, aligning with the technology and practices during the Victorian era.

Barry Brown is with the Mobile Life Centre in Stockholm,Sweden.He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States.There he borrowed a GPSequipped car to use during his stay.Mr Brown says,\\"They just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination.And,then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived.They actually put their home address in.So again,the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\\" Mr Brown says this is a common human error,but what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings,or failures,of GPS equipment.He says,\\"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn.Because they just give you the next turn,sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\\" Mr Brown says,\\"One of the things that struck us,perhaps the most important thing was that you have to know what you're doing when you use a GPS.There are these new skills that people have developed.There are these new competencies that you need to have to be able to use a GPS because they sometimes go wrong.This goes against a common belief that GPS systems are for passive drivers who lack navigational skills.\\" Barry Brown says to make GPS systems better we need a better understanding of how drivers,passengers and GPS systems work together.

Question: Where did the Celts who settled in Galatia pass through? Is \\"The Celts who settled in Galatia came through Thrace under the leadership of Leotarios and Leonnorios circa 270 BC.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"The Celts who settled in Galatia came through Thrace under the leadership of Leotarios and Leonnorios circa 270 BC.\\" is partly correct, but it does not encompass the entire geographical trajectory or provide all relevant historical context. The Celts who settled in Galatia were part of a larger group of Celtic tribes that migrated from central and western Europe in various stages throughout the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. These tribes had earlier dominions in areas now corresponding to modern-day France, Germany, Belgium, and Britain. Their initial migration took them through the Balkan Peninsula, where they caused significant cultural and political changes to existing populations. Their first known encounter was with the Macedonians in 279 BC, where the Celtic tribes, led by Brennus, attempted to plunder the rich city of Delphi. They were ultimately defeated, but in the process, they established themselves as a formidable force. Following Brennus' defeat, the Celts divided into smaller groups and continued their migration across the Balkan Peninsula. One of these groups, led by Leotarios and Leonnorios, aimed to establish a new home in the region known as Thrace, which was inhabited by Thracian tribes. Thrace, located in modern-day southeastern Europe, mainly encompassed territories in present-day Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Passing through Thrace, Leotarios and Leonnorios' group defeated the Thracian king Cavaros in 278 BC. After this victory, the Celts moved eastward and crossed the Bosporus Strait into Asia Minor (now modern-day Turkey). At the time, the region was under the control of the declining Seleucid Empire. Upon reaching Asia Minor, the Celtic group was offered a truce by Nicomedes I, the King of Bithynia. He offered them land in exchange for military support against his opponents. This region, later known as Galatia, comprised parts of the ancient territories of Phrygia, Lycaonia, and Cappadocia. Thus, the Celts who settled in Galatia did pass through Thrace, adding significantly to their journey from central and western Europe. This was an essential part of their odyssey, which ultimately culminated in the founding of Galatia circa 270 BC. It is important to understand that the migration and establishment of the Celtic tribes in Galatia were complex and multi-faceted, rather than just a single event or passage through Thrace."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For much of the past decade, patient numbers have been rising as would be expected with an ageing population. But since 2010, the numbers have levelled off - with just one in eight areas now doing more hips and knees and one in five seeing rises in cataracts. It comes amid mounting pressures on the health service. The challenges facing A&E units have been well documented, but reports have also been emerging that non-emergency care is being squeezed too. These findings - to be published on Monday in Dr Foster's annual hospital guide - provide perhaps the most comprehensive picture yet of what is happening. The health care analysts looked at the number of operations being carried out for the three types of procedures - among the most life-enhancing done by the NHS - for the past decade. It found virtually no change in the overall numbers over the past two years with the total numbers hovering around the 475,000 mark each year. Hip replacements were the only treatment out of the three that were still going up - although the rate of increase has slowed. Meanwhile, the number of cataract operations is at its lowest level for five years and 2012-13 saw the first fall in knee replacements for a decade. The review also provided details of what local areas were up to by looking at the individual figures for the 200-plus clinical commissioning groups which are now in charge of local health budgets. The data showed that just 27 (13%) areas saw a significant rise in knee replacements over the past two years, 27 (13%) a rise for hip replacements and 40 (19%) a rise for cataracts. Roger Taylor, co-founder of Dr Foster, said the findings suggested the squeeze on spending was having an impact on these \\"highly effective\\" treatments. \\"There has been a sharp slow-down in activity. We are seeing some operations fall when normally we see them increasing by 4%, 5% or 6% a year.\\" Postcode search: Find out how your area is doing The review will also highlight other areas of concern. Dr Foster analysed data on what it called \\"ineffective operations\\". These include procedures such as tonsillectomies and knee washouts where the benefits are marginal. While overall the numbers being done had fallen by 8% in the past five years there are still 124 areas where their use has increased since 2010-11. Mr Taylor added: \\"Money is being wasted on care that is of no benefit.\\" Colin Howie, vice president of the British Orthopaedic Association, said the findings were \\"very concerning\\". \\"By trying to save money in the short term, it will cost the NHS and society in the long term. These are highly effective operations because they restore mobility and reduce disability. \\"What is more, the research shows it is the most vulnerable in society - the elderly and poor - who are most likely to miss out.\\" A spokesman for NHS England said: \\"While the data raises important questions, we should be wary of leaping to the answers. \\"Cataracts, knees and hip replacements are generally 'good' but it is still the case that they can be overused. \\"We do a very significant number of these operations all over the country and it should not be taken as a given that this figure should automatically increase.\\" This article was about:","completion":"The article discusses the findings of a study conducted by Dr. Foster Research Group focused on three key medical procedures: knee replacements, hip replacements, and cataract operations. These procedures are largely due to the aging population, and the number of patients undergoing these surgeries has been rising for most of the past decade. However, since 2010, the growth has leveled off, with only one in eight areas now seeing increased hip and knee replacements and one in five areas experiencing a rise in cataract surgeries. The study reveals that the total number of these surgeries had hardly changed over the past two years, remaining around 475,000 operations each year. This stagnation in growth is thought to be a result of increased pressure on the NHS (National Health Service) and limitations on healthcare spending. Hip replacements are the only procedure of the three still seeing an increase in numbers, though the rate of growth has slowed down. On the other hand, cataract operations are now at their lowest numbers in five years, and 2012-13 saw the first decrease in knee replacements in a decade. The data also showed that: - 27 areas (13%) saw a significant rise in knee replacements over the past two years - 27 areas (13%) saw a rise for hip replacements - 40 areas (19%) experienced a rise for cataract surgeries Roger Taylor, co-founder of Dr. Foster, believes the stagnating numbers suggest that spending constraints are affecting these crucial treatments. He notes that there has been a sharp slowdown in activity, as some surgeries are no longer increasing at their usual 4%-6% yearly rate. The study also looked at data on \\"ineffective operations,\\" such as tonsillectomies and knee washouts, which have marginal benefits. The numbers of these procedures have fallen by 8% in the past five years, yet there are still 124 areas where their use has increased since 2010-11. Medical professionals have expressed concerns about the situation. Colin Howie, Vice President of the British Orthopaedic Association, views the findings as \\"very concerning\\" and believes that attempts to save money in the short term will cost the NHS and society in the long term. These operations are seen as highly effective, restoring mobility and reducing disability for patients, yet the research shows that vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and poor, are most likely to miss out on these procedures. A spokesperson for NHS England emphasized the need to be cautious when drawing conclusions from the data presented. Although these procedures are usually considered effective, they can also be overused, and it's important to analyze the reasons behind the numbers before making definitive claims about their impact on healthcare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He decides to take a one-week vacation in San Francisco, but this does not sit well with Paula Gibson (Pamela Britton), his confidential secretary and girlfriend, as he does not want her to accompany him.Bigelow meets and accompanies a group of randy men from a sales convention on a night on the town. At a \\"jive\\" nightclub called \\"The Fisherman\\", unnoticed by Bigelow, a stranger swaps his drink for another. (The nightclub scene includes one of the earliest depictions of the Beat sub-culture). The next morning, Bigelow feels ill. He visits a doctor at the general hospital, where tests reveal he swallowed a poison called \\"luminous toxin\\" for which there is no antidote. A second opinion confirms the grim diagnosis, and the other doctor implies that the poisoning must have been deliberate. Bigelow remembers his drink tasted strange. He flees from the hospital in a panic, wondering who poisoned him and why.With just a day or two to live at most, Bigelow sets out to untangle the events behind his impending death, interrupted occasionally by phone calls from Paula, whom never finds out about the predicament that he is in. Paula provides the first clue: a man named Eugene Philips who had urgently been trying to contact Bigelow by phone for the past two days has died, purportedly a suicide.

Based on the premise \\"Postal Service's domestic rates for First-Class and Priority Mail to the inbound mail distribution described above.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The USPS does not describe their rates. \\" is true?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states \\"Postal Service's domestic rates for First-Class and Priority Mail to the inbound mail distribution described above.\\" This suggests that there is a description of the Postal Service's domestic rates for First-Class and Priority Mail with reference to the inbound mail distribution. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis given is \\"The USPS does not describe their rates.\\" This statement claims that the USPS does not provide information on their rates. Step 3: Compare the hypothesis with the premise Now, let's compare the hypothesis and the premise. The premise seems to discuss the USPS providing information about their domestic rates for First-Class and Priority Mail in relation to the inbound mail distribution. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the USPS does not describe their rates at all. Step 4: Evaluate the hypothesis based on the premise Based on the premise provided, it states that the Postal Service does describe their rates for a particular service (First-Class and Priority Mail) in relation to inbound mail distribution. This fact contradicts the hypothesis, which claims that the USPS does not describe their rates. Conclusion: We cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"The USPS does not describe their rates.\\" is true based on the premise given. The premise indicates that the Postal Service provides some information related to their domestic rates for certain services, which goes against the hypothesis's assertion that the USPS does not describe their rates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bob liked herbal tea a lot more than adderall because the","completion":"natural benefits it offered not only provided a soothing sensation but also a plethora of health advantages that were not accompanied by the unwanted side effects often experienced with stimulant medications like Adderall. Herbal teas have been consumed for centuries across different cultures worldwide, and they are known for their numerous healing properties. Bob preferred herbal tea over Adderall as he discovered that these natural infusions were packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, which helped to boost his immune system, maintain overall health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Furthermore, many herbal teas have calming and stress-relieving effects, such as chamomile, lavender, and lemon balm. These teas aid in relaxation, promote better sleep, and help reduce anxiety, which is especially important for individuals like Bob who struggled with the stimulating and sometimes unnerving experience of taking Adderall. On the other hand, Adderall is a prescription medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It is a stimulant that works by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which enhances focus, alertness, and impulse control in people with ADHD. While Adderall can be highly effective for some individuals, it comes with a range of potential side effects, including insomnia, dry mouth, loss of appetite, headaches, and anxiety. Long-term use of Adderall also raises concerns about the risk of dependence and addiction, making many people, like Bob, wary of using it as a long-term solution. Additionally, Adderall can also interact with other medications or existing health conditions, causing more severe side effects or complications. For those who are sensitive or have negative reactions to stimulants, herbal teas serve as a gentler, more natural alternative that comes without the risk of dependency or harmful interactions. Bob's preference for herbal tea over Adderall is a testament to the rise in popularity of natural therapies, which may prove to be a more sustainable and healthier choice for long-term wellness. As each individual's needs and preferences differ, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before making any decisions on which treatment options might be best for your situation. However, for Bob, the benefits of herbal tea far outweighed those of Adderall, especially since they provided him with a sense of well-being and comfort without introducing any harsh or harmful side effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 5: Set up Christmas tree If the church plans to have a Christmas tree, select a suitable location for it, ideally on a visible spot to the congregation. Decorate the tree with lights, ornaments, and a tree topper. Optionally, the tree can feature a nativity scene, or a tree skirt with religious symbols, for added symbolism. Step 6: Add a nativity scene Set up a nativity scene in a prominent and visible area of the church, like near the altar or at an outdoor location visible to passersby. Ensure the scene is stable and securely assembled to avoid any mishaps or damage.

(CNN) -- A 22-year-old man from Pakistan hopes to soon swim the English Channel with an American friend -- but first he's got to navigate the currents of bureaucracy. College teammates David Gatz (left) and Usman Javaid want to swim the English Channel for charity. Usman Javaid, an Ohio college student who has won national swimming titles in his native Pakistan, wants to swim the channel with his best friend, David Gatz, a fellow member of the swim team at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio. They want to honor their international friendship by working together to accomplish a great feat: a relay across the English Channel. They also hope to raise money for charity. \\"They weren't satisfied I was going to","completion":"return to Pakistan after the swim,\\" Javaid told CNN in an interview. \\"They were concerned I might try to remain in the UK illegally.\\" Despite having won several national swimming titles and being an exemplary student at his university, Javaid encountered unforeseen hurdles when applying for a visa for the monumental swim. The visa application required evidence that Javaid would return to Pakistan after completing the challenge. However, the British authorities were not convinced by the documentation provided, and Javaid's visa application was denied. Disappointed but not defeated, Javaid and Gatz decided to persist in their plans and began exploring other options. They reached out to their local representatives and sought support from different organizations, including the Ohio Wesleyan University, which has expressed its backing to the duo tirelessly. College officials and faculty members have written letters vouching for Javaid's character, emphasizing his academic achievements and commitment to swimming. The pair also garnered support from the larger swimming community, including prominent international athletes and organizations. They believed that the attention their relay swim would receive would help raise awareness and funds for various charities, including those focused on providing clean water and education to underprivileged communities in Pakistan and around the world. Aware of the increased attention that their case was garnering, Gatz and Javaid felt a sense of urgency to secure the necessary permissions. They knew that overcoming the bureaucratic obstacles would be crucial if they wished to carry out their ambitious plans. Javaid then submitted an appeal to the British consulate, providing supplementary evidence to support his claim of temporary stay in the UK for the purpose of the Channel swim. As they awaited a decision on their appeal, Gatz and Javaid continued their rigorous training, motivated by their charitable initiatives and a determination to complete their relay swim, which they called \\"Swimming for Unity.\\" They focused on overcoming physical challenges and honing their skill, pushing their limits in both open water and pool practices. Finally, after months of advocacy, efforts, and anticipation, Usman Javaid received the good news that his visa appeal had been approved. The British consulate granted him a visitor's visa, allowing him to enter the UK to pursue the relay swim. With the bureaucratic obstacles finally behind them, Gatz and Javaid moved forward with their plans, finalizing logistics, and intensifying their training schedule in preparation for the Channel swim relay. They continued to engage supporters and publicize their cause, reminding everyone of the spirit of friendship, unity, and perseverance behind their quest.

Former Judge Opens Inquiry Into Savile Sexual Abuse Case The inquiry by Dame Janet Smith, a retired appeals court judge who once led an inquiry into a notorious serial killer, came as a senior police commander said Mr. Savile’s behavior might have gone unchecked for decades because different British institutions, including local police forces, failed to collate the evidence they had against the flamboyant personality who was seen as a philanthropist and a national treasure. At the same time, the former head of a BBC children’s charity, Children in Need, said that, even a decade ago, suspicions about Mr. Savile were so prevalent that “we didn’t want him anywhere near” the organization. Dame Janet’s inquiry is one of two that the BBC has commissioned into the scandal. It began on the first anniversary of Mr. Savile’s death at age 84, and a day after the British police arrested a former pop star, Paul Gadd, better known as Gary Glitter, in the widening scandal. Mr. Gadd has been accused of abusing a teenage girl on BBC premises. The scandal has exploded since ITV, a BBC rival, broadcast a documentary this month about Mr. Savile and his alleged abuses, opening a floodgate of complaints. The police now say 300 potential victims have come forward. Much soul-searching and public anger have focused on how Mr. Savile’s misconduct appears to have been widely known among colleagues and police officers who did little or nothing to restrain or prosecute him. Sharpening the questions about the BBC’s conduct, one of the network’s current affairs programs, “Newsnight,” began and then canceled an investigation into Mr. Savile late last year. Bernard Hogan Howe, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said on Monday that though Mr. Savile was accused a number of times while he was alive, police forces in different parts of Britain never put the picture together. Much attention has focused, too, on why successive heads of the BBC have said they were unaware of the rumors about Mr. Savile within the organization. They include the current director general, George Entwistle, and his predecessor, Mark Thompson, the incoming president and chief executive of The New York Times Company. Mr. Thompson was the organization’s head when the “Newsnight” investigation was canceled, a time when other BBC departments were planning holiday tributes to Mr. Savile. The extent of the mistrust surrounding Mr. Savile emerged from a BBC interview on Monday with Sir Roger Jones, a former BBC governor and the head of the Children in Need charity, who said that he had suspicions more than a decade ago, according to an article on the BBC Web site. “I think we all recognized he was a pretty creepy sort of character,” Mr. Jones said in the article. “We took the decision that we didn’t want him anywhere near the charity, and we just stepped up our child protection policies — which again would have put him at risk if he tried anything.” Still, he acknowledged that the charity had only suspicions against Mr. Savile. “If you’re going to go on the attack and make claims against him, then you’d need evidence, hard evidence that simply wasn’t there,” Mr. Jones was quoted as saying. The other inquiry, led by Nick Pollard, a former head of a rival network, Sky News, is looking specifically into the circumstances surrounding the cancellation of the “Newsnight” investigation. Compared with the public inquiries into the behavior of tabloid reporters and editors in Britain in the phone hacking scandal, which have unfolded in a glare of publicity, the inquiries into the Savile matter at the BBC seemed more opaque. A BBC spokesman and a person representing Dame Janet each said her inquiry began on Monday, but they declined to say who would go before the inquiry, where it was being conducted or whether it would operate in public. In response to a reporter’s questions, Dame Janet’s representative, Carolyn E. Pepper of the law firm Reed Smith, released a statement saying: “Dame Janet’s view is that it is not appropriate for her to give interviews or provide comment regarding the review at this time. Press information will be issued in due course.” Her inquiry is meant to gather testimony from people who have accused Mr. Savile of abusing them or who have raised concerns about his activities. It is also supposed to examine “the extent to which BBC personnel were or ought to have been aware of unlawful and/or inappropriate conduct by Jimmy Savile on BBC premises or on location for the BBC,” the BBC said. She is also supposed to determine whether the BBC’s child protection and whistle-blowing policies are adequate. The BBC has also said it is looking into nine more recent cases related to a variety of sexual harassment and abuse cases, but it has not said who was involved in them. Both her inquiry and Mr. Pollard’s investigation are supposed to be independent of BBC control, although both were appointed by BBC supervisory bodies. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Judging by the name, this tool seems to be a new or innovative (revolutionary) software solution that's designed to work with DVD PROJ files specifically. DVD refers to Digital Versatile Disc, and PROJ may be a file extension related to project files but it is not usually associated with DVDs, so it might be software-specific. File Analysis Tool suggests that it examines or works with these files in some manner, most likely to extract or process some sort of data. - \\"scans, analyzes, and reports back every detail about your DVD PROJ file\\" - This segment of the sentence tells us about the functionalities of the software. According to this, the tool performs three major operations. It scans the DVD PROJ files, presumably to gather and identify data. It then analyzes this data, which could involve interpreting, organizing, or possibly manipulating it in some way. Finally, it reports back every detail about the DVD PROJ file. This suggests that the tool provides the user with a detailed output of what it found or did during the scanning and analysis, giving complete insight into the file's contents, structure or any alteration performed.

Answer the following question: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.

Greenville PD did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. This decision might have led to cost savings, allowing them to allocate resources to other aspects of law enforcement, such as increasing personnel, investing in community outreach programs, and enhancing traditional crime-fighting strategies. However, the lack of investment in advanced technologies might limit their ability to solve complex cases, track criminals effectively, and secure convictions based on solid evidence. On the other hand, Grayville PD invested extensively in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. This investment might have provided them with better tools and capabilities to solve crimes faster and more accurately, identify and apprehend criminals, and prosecute cases with strong evidence. Advanced technologies, such as DNA testing and digital forensics, can significantly improve crime-solving rates, especially in cases involving violent crimes, cybercrimes, or organized criminal networks. However, the costs associated with these technologies might limit the resources available for other crime-fighting strategies, leading to potential drawbacks, as mentioned in the provided information. To determine which PD took a more efficient approach, we need to analyze the results of both departments in terms of crime-solving rates, the impact on overall crime rates, community satisfaction, and the ability to adapt to new forms of criminal activities. The efficiency of their approach will depend on the balance between using advanced technologies and applying traditional crime-fighting methods, combined with the effectiveness of their strategies on reducing crime rates and improving public safety. In summary, without specific data on the outcomes achieved by both Greenville and Grayville PDs, it is difficult to definitively say which department's approach was more efficient. Evaluating the effectiveness of their strategies would require analyzing their performance in various aspects, including crime-solving rates, crime reduction, community satisfaction, and adaptability to changing crime trends."},{"prompt":"Pick one category for the following text.

Input: The Ox-Bow Incident takes place in Nevada in 1885 and begins with Art Croft (Harry Morgan) and Gil Carter (Henry Fonda) riding into the town of Bridger's Wells. They go into Darby's Saloon and find that the atmosphere is subdued, in part because of the recent incidents of cattle-rustling (the stealing of livestock) in the vicinity. Everyone wants to catch the thieves.Gil learns that his former girlfriend left town at the start of the spring and drinks heavily to drown his sorrows. Art and Gil are possible rustler suspects simply because they are not often seen in town. The townspeople are wary of them, and a fight breaks out between Gil and a local rancher named Farnley. Immediately after the fight, another man races into town on horseback, goes into the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe to be the cattle rustlers. The posse is told by the local judge that they must bring the presumed rustlers back alive for trial, and that their deputization by a deputy is illegal, but little heed is taken of this. Art and Gil join the posse as well, as much to avoid being its target as to participate. Davies (Harry Davenport), who is vehemently opposed to forming the posse because of its capacity for \\"mob rule,\\" also joins. Among the other people in the posse are \\"Major\\" Tetley (Frank Conroy) and his son, Gerald (William Eythe). The major informs the posse that three men with cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass, and therefore shouldn't be too difficult to catch.On their journey, the posse encounters a stagecoach. They try to stop it, but the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, accidentally wounding Art in the left shoulder. In the coach are Rose Mapen (Mary Beth Hughes), Gil's old girlfriend, and her new, obviously rich husband, Swanson (George Meeker).Later in the night, in the Ox-Bow canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping on the ground, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates the men: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin (Dana Andrews); a Mexican named Juan Martínez (Anthony Quinn) who claims to be unable to understand English; and a delusional old man named Alva Hardwicke, portrayed by veteran Hollywood character actor/silent film director Francis Ford (brother of famed film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid, but that he received no bill of sale because the sale took place out on the range. No one believes Martin, and it is therefore decided that the three men are to be hanged at sunrise.Martin, as his last wish, writes a private letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, gives it to the others to read. Because of the letter's eloquence, Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die. However, Martin finds out that his letter has been read, and becomes angry at the betrayal of his privacy.During the argument, the Mexican, who is actually a gambler named Juan Morez, tries to escape and is shot. The posse discovers that Juan is able to speak \\"American\\" and ten other languages and that he has Kinkaid's gun. Major Tetley wants the men to be lynched immediately because he does not want any of the rustlers to escape through the courts. A vote is taken on whether the men should be hanged or taken back to face trial. Only seven of the group (of approximately twenty-five people), among them Davies, Gerald Tetley, Gil and Art, vote to take the men back to town alive; the rest support immediate hanging. Gil tries to stop it, but is overpowered. The group must choose three people to hit the horses out from under the condemned men. Farnley and Jenny Grier (Jane Darwell), the only woman in the posse, volunteer, and Gerald Tetley is ordered by his father to be the third. While the others hit the horses of the old man and Morez, Gerald Tetley does not, and the horse therefore simply walks out from under Martin. Farnley shoots Martin to kill him.After the lynching, the posse heads back towards Bridger's Wells. On the way, they meet Sheriff Risley (Willard Robertson). They tell him with pride of their actions, but the sheriff replies that Lawrence Kinkaid was not killed, is under the care of the doctor in Pike's Corner, and that the men who shot him have already been arrested. Risley strips the deputy of his badge and asks Davies, whom he knows would not have supported a hanging, to tell him who was involved. \\"All but seven,\\" Davies replies. \\"God better have mercy on you,\\" the sheriff tells the posse. \\"You won't get any from me.\\"The men of the posse gather back in Canby's Saloon and drink in silence. Major Tetley returns to his house and locks the door so his son cannot come in. His son yells at him through the door, telling him what he thinks of him. Major Tetley walks into another room and shoots himself. In the saloon, Gil reads Martin's letter out loud to Art while the other members of the posse are listening. In the closing scene, mirroring the initial scene, Gil and Art ride out of town to deliver the letter to Martin's wife and family.

Wrestling is a sport that demands both physical strength and technique. Lifting weights can help improve a wrestler's performance by increasing their strength, which is crucial for executing various moves, overpowering opponents, and maintaining stamina during matches. Given this, \\"have strength\\" is the most appropriate answer, as it directly relates to the advantages that weightlifting can provide to a wrestler. Now, to address and dismiss the other options: - \\"Strong\\" is a related concept to strength, but it is not a complete answer. It's just an adjective that describes the consequence of lifting weights. - \\"Take lessons\\" implies enrolling in classes or seeking instruction from a coach, which is beneficial but doesn't explain the purpose of weightlifting for wrestling specifically. - \\"Fo brushing\\" is not relevant or understandable in the context of wrestling and weightlifting. It seems like a typographical error or unrelated phrase. - \\"Get naked\\" is entirely unrelated and inappropriate for the topic of wrestling and weightlifting. It doesn't provide any explanation or connection to improving wrestling performance through weightlifting.

Rinse the zipper thoroughly with freshwater. Wash the zipper with a soap solution.","completion":"Title: Reviving Stuck Zippers: A Comprehensive Guide to Loosen and Maintain Zippers with Natural Solutions Introduction A stuck zipper can be the ultimate roadblock in our day-to-day activities and a challenge, especially when it occurs on our most valued garments or accessories. Whether it's a bag, jacket, or pair of jeans, zippers are an indispensable component, securing functionality and ease in our lives. When a zipper sticks, it can be frustrating and render the item unusable. However, worry no more as this article presents a comprehensive guide to loosening zippers using natural solutions, including beeswax, fresh water, and soap to help breathe life back into your garments and accessories. Step 1: Open the zipper as much as possible The first important step you should take when faced with a stuck zipper is to attempt to open it as much as you can. Gently pull the zipper, using minimal force, to prevent damaging the item or causing the teeth to misalign further. Be patient and remember that applying too much pressure can result in rendering the zipper permanently damaged. Step 2: Use beeswax to loosen the zipper Once you have opened the zipper space adequately, you can now proceed to apply a lubricant to ease the movement of the zipper. Our recommendation for this purpose is beeswax, as it is an eco-friendly, natural option, and typically doesn't stain or damage fabrics. For optimal results, follow these guidelines: - Rub the edge of a beeswax bar or use a cotton swab dipped in beeswax along both sides of the zipper's teeth. - If you don't have access to beeswax, an alternative to natural lubricants includes lip balm. However, avoid petroleum jelly, as it may darken or stain the fabric. - Exert gentle pressure to glide the zipper back and forth, allowing the lubricant to penetrate and ease the stuck areas. Repeat until the zipper runs smoothly. Step 3: Rinse the zipper thoroughly with freshwater After applying the lubricant of choice and moving the zipper back and forth gently, clean off any accumulated dirt, grime, or excess lubricant. To achieve this, rinse the zipper thoroughly with fresh, clean water. Ensuring the zipper is free from residues and dirt particles will help preserve its function and longevity. Step 4: Wash the zipper with a soap solution The final step is to use a soap solution to clean the zipper and eliminate the chances of any residue buildup. Take a small amount of mild soap or detergent and mix it with water to create a solution. Use a toothbrush, sponge, or soft cloth to gently clean the zipper's teeth and parts. While engaging in this process, be cautious to avoid the soapy solution from making contact with the garment or accessory material, as it may cause harm or discoloration. After cleaning the zipper, rinse it thoroughly with clean water and pat dry with a towel or allow it to air dry before using. Conclusion Maintaining the function and appearance of zippers is essential for preserving the life of your valued items. This comprehensive guide, which employs natural solutions such as beeswax, fresh water, and soap, offers a reliable, effective, and environmentally friendly means of loosening stuck zippers and ensuring their longevity. By adhering to these steps and practicing proper zipper maintenance, you can easily remedy zipper issues and extend the life of your favorite garments and accessories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It also mentions that class participation can be a component of the final grade, which adds to its relevance. (a) This option uses the phrase \\"otherwise bland environment,\\" which is irrelevant and could be considered offensive. It also dives into the topic of confrontation, which is not the focus of the paragraph. (b) This option does not directly address assertiveness or speaking up in class, as it mainly focuses on missing a class, showing intelligence, and catching comments. These points do not contribute to the development of assertiveness.

A. hockey game B. cold weather C. refrigerator D. zoo E. antarctica The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer is D. Zoo. Here's a detailed explanation for each option: A. Hockey Game - Ice is an essential part of a hockey game, as the sport is played on a surface made of frozen water, called an ice rink. Therefore, it would be highly likely to find ice at a hockey game. B. Cold Weather - Ice is formed when water freezes, which occurs at temperatures below its freezing point (32°F or 0°C). Therefore, during cold weather, it would be likely to find ice on surfaces such as sidewalks, roads, or natural bodies of water like rivers and lakes. C. Refrigerator - Most refrigerators have a cooling mechanism that involves the circulation of refrigerants, which can cause the water vapor inside the refrigerator to freeze. This results in the formation of ice, especially in the freezer section. Finding ice in a refrigerator is a common occurrence. D. Zoo - A zoo primarily serves as a facility where various animals are housed and cared for. While certain animals, like polar bears or penguins, may require ice or cold conditions for their habitats, it would not be common to find ice widely present throughout the zoo.

Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"The suggested answer is not entirely accurate, as it does not fully address the question of what material a mousepad is made out of. Instead, it mentions a specific feature of some mousepads (a padded wrist rest), which is not necessarily relevant to the core question. A more appropriate answer to the question \\"what material is a mouse pad made out of?\\" would cover the different types of materials that could be found in typical mouse pads. So, a detailed response would look something like this: Mouse pads can be made from various materials, depending on the design and purpose. The most common materials include: 1. Rubber foam base: This serves as the bottom layer of a mousepad, providing grip and stability. The rubber foam base is anti-slip and can be either hard or soft, depending on user preference. 2. Fabric (e.g., polyester, microfiber, or cloth): This is a top layer material that provides a smooth surface for the mouse to glide across. The fabric layer can also have varying textures, which may affect the precision of the mouse movements. Some mouse pads have heat-treated surfaces for a smoother glide. 3. Plastic (e.g., polyethylene or acrylic): Some mouse pads have a hard plastic surface instead of a fabric layer. Hard plastic pads generally offer greater durability and are often preferred by gamers for their low friction surfaces that enable quicker mouse movements. 4. Metal (e.g., aluminum): Metal mouse pads are less common but provide a sleek, premium feel. They are durable and offer a unique texture. 5. Glass: These mouse pads typically have a frosted or textured surface to provide optimal tracking for the mouse. Glass mouse pads are easier to clean and have an elegant appearance, but they may not be suitable for all mice and users. 6. Gel or foam wrist rest: As you mentioned, some mouse pads do include a padded wrist rest, which is made of a comfortable gel or foam material. This additional feature is designed to provide ergonomic support and alleviate strain during long periods of use. In conclusion, while the suggested answer you provided is not completely incorrect, it does not offer a comprehensive understanding of the various materials that mouse pads can be made from.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"An earlier heartwood results in what?\\" Context: \\"The term heartwood derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree. This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule. Others never form heartwood.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"An earlier heartwood formation results in a tree having a thinner layer of live sapwood. In certain tree species, heartwood develops early in the tree's life, while in others, this change occurs gradually or does not occur at all. The formation of heartwood is primarily due to the tree species' natural traits and growth patterns, rather than any specific factors or conditions. Heartwood, the central portion of a tree's trunk, consists of dead and decayed cells, giving it a darker color and denser composition compared to the surrounding sapwood. It plays a crucial role in giving the tree mechanical support and stability. In contrast, sapwood is the living outer layer of the tree and is involved in conducting water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves and branches. Species that exhibit early heartwood formation and thin sapwood layers include chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras. In these species, the swift conversion of sapwood to heartwood can be useful for the tree's long-term survival. Early heartwood formation provides additional structural strength, often enabling these trees to better withstand harsh environmental conditions and resist various external threats, such as pests, diseases, and storm damage. On the other hand, species with late or minimal heartwood formation, like maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, tend to have thicker sapwood layers. In these trees, the larger sapwood area allows for more efficient water and nutrient transport, which can contribute to a faster overall growth rate. However, these species may be more prone to damage or decay in the sapwood region due to their higher living cell content and moisture levels, which can attract pests and fungi. Ultimately, an earlier heartwood formation is a natural growth pattern found in specific tree species, resulting in thinner sapwood layers. This characteristic provides increased structural support and helps enhance the tree's durability in challenging conditions. In contrast, tree species with thicker sapwood layers may benefit from improved water and nutrient transport efficiency, potentially leading to faster growth rates. Both traits have their advantages and drawbacks and are largely determined by the tree species' inherent genetics and growth habits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: While Ava had its hands full with the Manipuri raids in Upper Burma, a rebellion broke out at Pegu in November 1740. Ethnic Mon officials selected Smim Htaw Buddhaketi, a cousin of the king at Ava, as their king. The court at Pegu consolidated its hold in Lower Burma. Starting in 1742, Pegu, with renegade Dutch and Portuguese musketeers, began its annual raids of the upcountry. Because of the Manipuri threat, Ava could only send small armies to the south in 1743 and 1744, neither of which made any mark. The war \\"carried on languidly\\", with neither side achieving any lasting advantage until 1747. In December 1747, Binnya Dala came to power in Pegu, and the new king was determined to finish the war. He was not satisfied to gain independence for Lower Burma itself but determined to make Upper Burma its tributary. He stopped the annual raids and began planning for a decisive invasion. He sought and received French East India Company's support in firearms. Alarmed, Ava too sought support from China but no help materialised. In November 1751, Pegu launched a full-scale invasion by land and by river with a total strength of 30,000. Ava had prepared an extensive defensive line around Ava—a riverside fort at Sinbyukyun on the Irrawaddy, and a series of forts at Sintgaing, Tada-U and Pinya en route to Ava. By mid-January, the invasion forces had overcome Ava's defences, and laid siege to the city. On 21 March 1752, the invaders broke through the city's outer walls. Two days later, they breached the inner walls and took the city. The 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty had fallen. Question: What city was taken by the invaders on 21 March 1752?

Here is a detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"This amendment\\" - \\"Tämä tarkistus\\" In Finnish, the word for 'amendment' is 'tarkistus,' and 'this' is expressed as 'tämä.' 2. \\"would still imply\\" - \\"viittaisi kuitenkin edelleen\\" 'Would' in Finnish is often translated as a conditional form of the verb, in this case, 'viittaisi' (from 'viitata,' meaning 'to imply' or 'to refer'). The word 'still' is translated as 'edelleen,' and 'kuitenkin' means 'however' or 'nonetheless,' which gives some nuance to the sentence, reflecting the feeling that even though something else has happened or changed, this implication still exists. 3. \\"some new obligations\\" - \\"sellaisiin uusiin velvoitteisiin\\" In Finnish, 'some' can be translated as 'sellaisiin,' meaning 'such' or 'those.' 'New obligations' is translated as 'uusiin velvoitteisiin' ('uusi' means 'new' and 'velvoitteet' means 'obligations'). The plural form is used here, and the case ending 'iin' shows that the obligations are something that has not yet been discussed in the Council. 4. \\"for Member States\\" - \\"jäsenvaltioille\\" The phrase 'for Member States' is translated as 'jäsenalioille.' 'Jäsenvaltio' means 'Member State,' and 'jäsenvaltioille' is the plural form of 'jäsenalio' in the allative case, which means that it shows the direction of movement or action towards something. 5. \\"which have not yet been discussed\\" - \\"joita ei ole vielä käsitelty\\" 'Which' can be translated as 'joita,' and 'not yet' as 'ei vielä.' 'Been discussed' is expressed through the verb 'käsitelty,' which is the passive past participle of the verb 'käsitellä' (meaning 'to discuss' or 'to handle'). The auxiliary verb 'olla' meaning 'to be' is used in the negative form 'ei ole' to express the negation. 6. \\"in the Council\\" - \\"neuvostossa\\" 'Neuvosto' means 'council' in Finnish, and 'neuvostossa' is the inessive case of the noun, indicating that the action (in this case, discussion) is happening inside or within it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Fertilizer runoff can create dead zones in the ocean. Choices: - fresh zones - barren zones - hot zones - dead zones A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"dead zones. Fertilizer runoff plays a significant role in the creation of dead zones in the ocean. As rain or irrigation washes fertilizers off farms, lawns, and other land surfaces, these nitrogen and phosphorus-loaded substances flow into rivers and streams and eventually make their way to the ocean. There, they provide a surplus of nutrients that phytoplankton and algae thrive on, causing excessive growth or 'bloom.' These intense blooms consume a large portion of the available oxygen in the water, as when they die, their decomposition process steals oxygen from the surrounding water environment. This process, also known as eutrophication, can lead to hypoxic or low-oxygen conditions capable of suffocating marine life. The areas where oxygen has been severely depleted to the point where little to no aquatic life can survive are referred to as 'dead zones.' While some small organisms can exist there, the biodiversity is significantly reduced, and larger marine creatures such as fish and shellfish often avoid these areas. This cause of nutrient pollution is a serious environmental issue. Dead zones can be seasonal or persistent. Dead zones are of particular concern because they threaten biodiversity, disrupt ecosystems, and have economic impacts on commercial and recreational fisheries. Controlling nutrient sources and timing of fertilizer applications can help reduce the severity and extent of dead zones. Therefore, the correct choice would be \\"dead zones,\\" as fertilizer runoff leads to an excessive nutrient supply which results in oxygen-deprived areas in the ocean, killing marine life and creating 'dead zones.' It's a pressing environmental issue that requires mitigation for the health of our oceans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Quinn?\\", is \\"careless\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, it would not be accurate to describe Quinn as \\"careless\\" just because Quinn texted Riley back after receiving a distressed message. In fact, responding to a distressed message is an act of care and concern, and it shows that Quinn values their relationship with Riley and is attentive to their friend's needs. Before jumping to conclusions and labeling someone as \\"careless,\\" it's important to consider multiple factors and instances that illustrate an individual's character. Being described as \\"careless\\" implies that the person shows a lack of attention or consideration for others, as well as a lack of concern for the consequences of their actions. On the contrary, in this situation, Quinn's response to Riley's message indicates that they pay attention to others' emotions and they make an effort to support and be there for their friends when needed. To get a comprehensive understanding of Quinn's character, it would be necessary to look at additional instances and examine their behavior in various contexts. In terms of a friendship context, we could consider factors such as: 1. How Quinn treats Riley and other friends regularly: Observe if they are consistently supportive, empathetic, and understanding or if they frequently disregard others' feelings and needs. 2. Quinn's interaction with their social circle: Determine if Quinn consistently shows interest and engages with friends’ lives, or if they are detached and self-centered. 3. How Quinn responds to different circumstances: Assess if Quinn adapts their behavior and attitude accordingly to different situations, or if they often act recklessly without considering consequences and possible impacts on others. 4. Reliability and consistency: Check if Quinn is someone that can be counted on when needed and stays true to their words, or if they have a history of forgetting promises and backing out of plans. 5. Communication: Evaluate if Quinn fosters open communication and actively listens to their friends' concerns, or if they are dismissive and ignore problems others face. By looking at these factors, it would be possible to create a more accurate portrayal of Quinn's character than just labeling them as \\"careless.\\" Based on the initial scenario given, Quinn seems to demonstrate care and concern for Riley by responding to their distressed message.

Now let's analyze the given phrases: Head: PersonX finishes the whole thing Tail: PersonX can't pay attention long enough To determine whether the Head can be hindered by the Tail, let's see if the situation mentioned in the Tail disrupts the goal mentioned in the Head. The goal in the Head is for PersonX to finish the whole thing. The Tail mentions that PersonX can't pay attention long enough, which implies that PersonX may struggle with focusing on the task long enough to complete it. Based on this analysis, the Tail hinders the Head. So, the answer is: A: Yes"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 0 = 3*g + 27 - 15 for g.. What is the answer??","completion":"Alright, little buddy! Let me help you understand this problem. We have an equation: 0 = 3*g + 27 - 15 First, let's see what happens when we take away 15 from 27. Imagine you have 27 candies and you give 15 away. You count what's left and find: 27 - 15 = 12 Now our equation looks like this: 0 = 3*g + 12 Next, we want to \\"move\\" the 12 from one side to the other to make it easier to find g. To do this, we're going to subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. It's like taking away 12 candies from your pile of 12. You'll have: 0 - 12 = 3*g This leaves us with: -12 = 3*g Now, we want to find out how much 'g' is. Think of it like splitting -12 candies into 3 even groups. To find how much each group has, we'll divide -12 by 3: -12 ÷ 3 = -4 So, g = -4. That's our answer! If we take 4 away from each of the 3 groups, there'll be no candies left over."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Seven Movie plot: In an unidentified city of constant rain and urban decay, Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is preparing to retire and leave the horrors of the city. Before he retires, he is partnered with Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), a cocky, young and short-tempered cop from Springfield, a comparatively small town. The two investigate the murder of a highly obese man (Bob Mack) who was fed spaghetti until a kick to his stomach burst him open. Somerset investigates the murder while Mills is given the murder case of Defense Attorney Eli Gould (Gene Borkan), with GREED written in Gould's blood on the floor. Gould was forced to carve a pound of flesh off of his body, and subsequently bled to death. The police captain gives Somerset an evidence container with three slivers of a plastic-like material found in the stomach of the obese man, which he was forced to consume along with the spaghetti. Going to the victim's house, Somerset finds three groove marks in front of the refrigerator and finds that the plastic-like slivers fit into them perfectly. Knowing the slivers resulted from the refrigerator being moved, Somerset looks behind it. He finds the word GLUTTONY written behind the fridge in grease, along with a note containing a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost. Somerset theorizes that a serial killer is basing his crimes on the Seven Deadly Sins, with five more to go.To give Mills and Somerset a chance to get along with each other, Mills's wife, Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) invites Somerset over for dinner. While they are eating, a train passes by on the track nearby, making the building and all its contents and inhabitants tremble: the couple mention that that's why the realtor was so nervous for them to see the apartment quickly. After Tracy goes to bed, Mills and Somerset examine case evidence from the two scenes. They find a picture of Gould's wife with blood painted around the eyes. Realizing that this means she is supposed to spot something about the murder scene that nobody else would, the detectives... My question: What is Somersets advice? Answer:","completion":"Somerset's advice is to re-examine the crime scene, with a particular focus on the things that Gould's wife might notice that others wouldn't have. This will help them understand what the killer wanted her and the detectives to see, possibly providing more insight into the case and potentially uncovering more clues that could lead to the killer and the other murders related to the Seven Deadly Sins."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

I was quite happy with the ease of instalation and the quality of the TV picture on my monitor. However, now it is November and the tuner seems to have completely crapped out. I went to the Pinnacle web site, and I found out the guarantee is 30 days and the problem with total failure at 6 months or so is pretty common. I was directed to an on line b-board where there were a number of postings of buyers whose experience was exactly like mine. There seems to be no recourse or fix other than replacement at my cost. Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. The author initially expresses satisfaction with the product's easy installation and the TV picture quality, but then goes on to describe issues they faced with the product over time. The tuner failing after just six months of use is a significant problem, as it impedes the primary function of the product. Moreover, the reviewer's experience of not being able to find a solution for the issue, and discovering that the guarantee for the product is only 30 days, adds to the negative sentiment. The mention of other buyers with similar experiences on the online message board further reinforces the prevalence and severity of the issue. This creates a sense of discontent and disappointment among potential buyers, who may be apprehensive about investing in a product with such negative feedback. In conclusion, this product review highlights the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the product's reliability, the short duration of the guarantee, and the lack of support from the manufacturer. This leads to an overall negative tone, which is likely to influence potential customers' perception of the product negatively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a title for this article: Cornerback Bashaud Breeland was one of seven Redskins players listed as a limited participant during Wednesday’s practice. He returned to the practice field for the first time since suffering a right ankle injury in Week 3 against the New York Giants. Breeland said the ankle was stiff, but he didn’t experience any pain during practice. He doesn’t think it’s enough to impact his play however. He has been sidelined the past two games because of the injury, and Breeland said he’s itching to get back on the field. “It feels like I ain’t played in five games,” Breeland said. “You know [with the way] I started the season, I’m just ready to go ahead and turn the hat over.” He received some negative tweets from Redskins fans after celebrating Washington’s victory on Sunday over the Baltimore Ravens. Breeland responded and said he “wanted to be the villain at that point in time” because of criticism after a win. His season got off to a rough start after an impressive training camp. Breeland recorded an interception in the season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but he allowed two touchdowns to wide receiver Antonio Brown on plays that could’ve resulted in takeaways. It spiraled down from there as questions arose about why the Redskins didn’t use cornerback Josh Norman to trail Brown. During the second half of Washington’s game against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 2, defensive coordinator Joe Barry made the switch to have Norman trail wide receiver Dez Bryant during the fourth quarter. these so call redskins fans need to stop wasting their breathe talking to me like im a slouch check ur history real talk #HTTR — Bashaud Breeland (@Salute_me17) October 10, 2016 “To me, I feel like I’m one of those players where I know I messed up,” Breeland said. “I know I’ve played bad, and I critique myself. I feel like Redskins fans, they should know me as a player being here for three years. They shouldn’t have to keep telling me I played bad even though my team winning. It’s a new start. It’s a fresh week. You don’t have to keep relaying that to me. I know that. “Those plays lost us the game, and I know that. I don’t fault them for what they’re saying. But them knowing me, and if you’re a real Redskins fan and you know me, then you should know that I’m always going to bounce back. That was my only issue. It don’t bother me when they say that.” Breeland hasn’t had a chance to redeem himself because of the injury he suffered during the Giants game. He said he wanted to show Redskins fans in his tweets that his confidence hasn’t been shot despite the slow start. “I feel good,” Breeland said when asked if he’ll play on Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles. “I feel confident that I’m capable of playing. The decision is up to my coaches. Everything else is out of my control.” Along with Breeland, inside linebacker Su’a Cravens (concussion), cornerback Dashaun Phillips (hamstring), outside linebacker Trent Murphy (shoulder), left tackle Trent Williams (knee), defensive end Chris Baker (foot) and Norman (wrist) were all also limited.

Dan didn't have alcohol with him. But I can use this background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. What is an answer for this question: Which of the two people had more blood vessels dilate?

When Tom drank the alcohol, it caused his blood vessels to widen, particularly those near the surface of his skin. This increase in blood flow near the skin's surface led to the sensation of warmth, as the nerve endings were stimulated by the influx of warm blood. However, this also made it easier for his body to exchange heat with the cold external environment, which could potentially lower his core body temperature. On the other hand, Dan did not consume any alcohol, so his blood vessels were not subjected to the vasodilating effects of alcohol. Therefore, his blood vessels remained relatively constricted compared to Tom's, and he did not experience the same sensation of warmth as Tom. In summary, Tom, who drank alcohol, had more blood vessels dilate due to the vasodilating effects of alcohol compared to Dan, who did not consume any alcohol."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls.

She examines a red one and notices that it bends much more easily than a green one. Which pole should she choose if she wants to lower the likelihood that the pole will snap? (A) green vaulting pole (B) red vaulting pole. What is the most sensical answer between \\"red vaulting pole\\" and \\"green vaulting pole\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"red vaulting pole\\" and \\"green vaulting pole\\" would be the green vaulting pole (A). To understand the reasoning behind this answer, let us consider the situation that Tamara is in and the properties of each pole. Tamara needs a new vaulting pole for her upcoming meet, which means that she hopes to find a pole that will be reliable, safe, and efficient in helping her perform her best. When Tamara examines the red and green poles, she notices a significant difference in their flexibility. The red pole bends much more easily than the green one. This observation leads to an important question: which of these properties is more desirable in a pole-vaulting context? For an effective pole vault, the athlete relies on the pole to transfer their forward momentum into vertical lift. The pole needs to be strong and flexible enough to withstand the stress and absorb the energy during this process. If the pole is too weak or flexible, it can snap or lose power when recoiling, which may cause injury to the athlete or negatively affect the performance. In this case, Tamara's observation suggests that the green pole is less flexible and potentially stronger compared to the easily bendable red pole. A pole that is less prone to bending can typically hold up more weight and pressure without snapping. Therefore, the green pole (A) seems to be a better choice for Tamara, as it lowers the likelihood that the pole will snap during the competition and helps her ensure a more secure and successful performance. In conclusion, the most sensical answer for Tamara's situation between the two vaulting pole options is the green vaulting pole (A), as it displays characteristics of a more reliable, safe, and efficient tool for her upcoming meet compared to the red one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are many playing factors that you must consider when placing a bet including: Performance of the starting pitcher. The strength of a team’s bullpen. A team’s record at home vs away. A team’s record in head-to-head play. A team offensive output. Baseball betting lines are available everyday. You may choose from a variety of options depending on where you place your bet. Options typically include betting on moneylines, totals, runlines, and futures. Don’t settle on just one place to bet, often called a sportsbook. Place different wagers at different sportsbooks to ensure you are getting the best odds. Seek out the sportsbook that will give you the best payout for your bet. Shop around to find the best payouts. If you find that a sportsbook in a casino 30 minutes away is paying 5 cents better than your favourite local sportsbook, it's best to go with the one 30 minutes away. Maximize your dollar. Join at least one betting exchange in addition to your favourite dimeline sportsbook. A betting exchange is similar to a sportsbook except players determine their own betting lines with one another. In other words, you will determine the payout with the person you are betting against. Dimeline odds ensures that the odds on favorite and the underdog are separated by 10 cents on the dollar, thus the term dimeline. For example, if the favored team is given -150 odds, then a line of +140 will be given to the underdog, which is a 10 cent difference. If you choose the favourite the payout will be less than if you bet on the underdog to win. The team with the negative sign in front of it is the favourite. The team with the plus sign is the underdog. Dimelines work in your favour because the sportsbook can’t over-shade the favourite without exposing themselves on the back side with a large underdog line. If a sportsbook offers 15 or 20 cent odds, the favourite and underdog will be separated by 15 or 20 cents. This puts you at a disadvantage so be weary. Choosing a dimeline book ensures that your winnings will be higher over the long term, regardless of who you bet. Betting exchanges cut out the middle man and let bettors from around the world offer their own money lines directly to other bettors. This results in lines that are more favourable than any sportsbook. Additionally, a betting exchange won’t straddle the line. This means it won’t always separate the favourite and the underdog by exactly 10 or 20 cents. It may even be common to find no or almost no separation between the favourite and the underdog. You can’t get better than equal odds.

For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny.

He is also accused of fleeing to Spain 10 days later \\"to avoid arrest, prosecution and conviction\\". Mr Paterson denies all the charges against him and has lodged two special defences of alibi and incrimination. The trial is taking place at the High Court in Glasgow. An excerpt from a telephone call made by Mr Paterson to his girlfriend Sarah Maguire from prison in October last year was played to the court. In it he was heard telling her that he had been served with his indictment and that there were 350 witnesses on the list, including her father. Giving evidence to the jury, Miss Maguire's father Kevin Maguire, 70, told the court that Mr Paterson was in a relationship with his daughter and before going to Spain in January 2010 sometimes stayed at their house. Det Sgt Grant Durie, who searched the house where Miss Maguire lived with her father in Cumbernauld, also gave evidence. He told the court he was the crime scene manager and that during the search a bulletproof vest was found under the bed in Miss Maguire's room. Advocate depute Iain McSporran asked if it was if it was \\"unusual\\" to find it and he said it was. The prosecutor asked how many times he had previously come across a bulletproof vest during searches and he replied: \\"That was the first time, sir.\\" The officer also told the court that Kevin Carroll had the nickname \\"Gerbil\\". He confirmed that a man called Ross Monaghan had been arrested and charged with Mr Carroll's murder. It is claimed - while masked and acting with others - Mr Paterson repeatedly discharged loaded handguns at 29-year-old Mr Carroll shooting him on the head and body. The 35-year-old is also accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. The indictment claims that on 23 January 2010 he boarded a flight from Glasgow to Malaga \\"to avoid arrest, prosecution and conviction\\".

Title: The Ruins Movie plot: Two young American couples â Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) and Amy (Jena Malone), and Eric (Shawn Ashmore) and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) â enjoy their vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias.

Boris Savinkov was at the head of an army of 20,000 to 30,000 largely Russian POWs, and was accompanied by Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Zinaida Gippius.

In August 1920, the Polish army had reached a total strength of 737,767 soldiers; half of that was on the frontline. Given Soviet losses, there was rough numerical parity between the two armies; and by the time of the battle of Warsaw, the Poles might have even had a slight advantage in numbers and logistics.Among the major formations on the Polish side was the First Polish Army.

Tweet: i really miss my 1/2&quot; lobes Choose from: *negative. *positive.","completion":"Before analyzing the sentiment of the tweet \\"i really miss my 1/2\\" lobes\\", let's first understand the context of the text. The tweet is referring to \\"1/2\\" lobes which indicate the size of earlobe stretching (piercings) that the person used to have. This tweet consists of two main elements: \\"really miss\\" and \\"1/2\\" lobes\\". The element \\"really miss\\" signifies a sense of longing and craving for something that the user used to have, which in this case, are the 1/2\\" lobes. Missing something usually signifies a positive sentiment; however, it is important to note that missing something means that it is no longer present or the user doesn't have it anymore. This absence contributes to a negative sentiment as well. The element \\"1/2\\" lobes refers to a specific size of earlobe stretching the user used to have. Talking about a past earring choice indicates a personal preference or experience, which is neither inherently positive nor negative. Taking the two elements into account, the sentiment in this tweet can be seen as a mix of both positive and negative emotions. On one hand, the positive sentiment comes from the fact that the user has fond memories or positive feelings regarding their 1/2\\" lobes. On the other hand, the negative sentiment is due to the absence or loss of those 1/2\\" lobes, which is something the user misses or longs for. However, considering the overall tone of the tweet and that the user has chosen to express their longing for their 1/2\\" lobes, it can be inferred that the primary sentiment is negative. This is because the tweet focuses on the absence and longing more than the appreciation or positive feelings associated with the 1/2\\" lobes. Therefore, the sentiment of the following tweet: \\"i really miss my 1/2\\" lobes\\" can be considered *negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Navarrette: A black actress came out for Romney and got slammed and reviled. Limbaugh calls activist a 'slut,' he says, columnist blasted for changing parties. Nobody can disagree without going on the attack, he writes, and leaders just as bad.","completion":"Title: The Growing Divide: How Discord and Name-Calling Lead to a Fragmented Society The United States of America has long been acclaimed as a land of freedom - a place where people of diverse backgrounds, opinions, and beliefs can coexist in peace. However, in recent years, a worrisome trend has emerged. As noted by political commentator Ruben Navarrette, the nation now seems to be sharply divided into two camps that refuse to engage in meaningful dialogue, opting instead for relentless name-calling and division. In his article, Navarrette highlights instances where celebrities and public figures are not only vehemently criticized for their political views, but also subject to personal attacks and vitriolic language. He cites the example of a black actress who publicly endorsed then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The actress faced backlash in the form of verbal abuse and hatred. This troubling episode underscores the fact that, regardless of one's profession or personal life, political differences are being used as grounds for marginalization and ridicule. The political landscape is also replete with instances where prominent figures themselves engage in name-calling. Navarrette refers to conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh's labeling of an activist as a \\"slut,\\" and a columnist being criticized for switching political parties. It seems that, to an ever-increasing extent, the limits of decency are being crossed as political opponents seek to demean each other. This ongoing - and escalating - trend of attacking our fellow citizens due to their political beliefs has far-reaching consequences. It is slowly eroding the foundations of our democracy, which is built on the idea that rational debate and the exchange of ideas should play key roles in shaping policies and opinions. Name-calling, in contrast, is devoid of substance and serves only to poison the atmosphere. Furthermore, when name-calling grows to be the norm, it discourages people from engaging in political conversations. Fearful of harsh judgments and potential ostracism, individuals may prefer to keep their thoughts and opinions to themselves. This climate of silence and mistrust further widens the divide between the two camps and stifles the development of innovative ideas and solutions. It is clear, then, that a solution to this problem is sorely needed. Political discourse must return to its roots in respectful, open debate, where individuals can disagree without resorting to ad-hominem attacks. We must foster a culture in which it is possible for a person to endorse a particular candidate or political party without fear of being vilified. This necessitates a collective commitment to civility and understanding, both from our political leaders and from the average citizen. One approach to fostering such a change is through grassroots initiatives that encourage dialogue between people of different political persuasions. Creating safe spaces where people can discuss political topics without fear of judgment can break the ice and help develop a sense of mutual respect. These kinds of conversations can promote empathy and understanding while also breaking down stereotypes. In conclusion, the political polarization and name-calling that Ruben Navarrette describes in his article represent significant barriers to progress and unity in our society. To bridge the gap and heal the rifts that have formed, we must all do our part to encourage respectful, meaningful conversations and promote understanding across the political spectrum. The future of our nation - and our democracy - depends on our ability to set aside our differences, resist the impulse to attack one another, and find common ground."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The intricate design features a heart held by two hands, with a crown above it, representing love, friendship, and loyalty, respectively. The traditional Irish ring's rich history dates back to the small fishing village of Claddagh in Galway, where the ring was first created, and its use has since then carried on & transcended beyond the Irish culture. One fascinating aspect of the Claddagh ring is the way it's worn, which indicates the wearer's relationship status. This article will delve into the subtle art of communicating one's relationship status through the positioning of the Claddagh ring on the ring finger of the right hand. The Claddagh Ring: Origins and Symbolism The origins of the Claddagh ring can be traced back to the 17th century in Ireland. Among several legends about the ring's creation, the most popular and widely accepted one revolves around Richard Joyce, a Galway native and fisherman who was separated from his beloved when he was captured by pirates and sold into slavery. While in captivity, Joyce learned the art of metalwork and fashioned the first Claddagh ring to symbolize his love, friendship, and loyalty to his sweetheart whom he hoped to return to someday. Eventually, Joyce gained his freedom and reunited with his love, presenting her with the ring he had crafted. The word \\"Claddagh\\" itself refers to the village of Claddagh in Galway, where this romantic story originated. Wearing the Claddagh Ring: The Art of Signaling Relationship Status The Claddagh ring has become a beloved symbol of Irish identity, and the subtle method of wearing it to signify one's relationship status has resonated with people worldwide. To demonstrate the nuances of this tradition, we will explore the various positions and their corresponding meanings: 1. Wear the Ring on the Right Hand, Heart Facing Outward To indicate that you are single and potentially open to love, wear the Claddagh ring on the ring finger of your right hand, with the heart pointing outward, away from your body. This positioning of the heart is an open invitation for someone to capture it and symbolizes that the wearer's heart is not yet committed to another. In this stance, the heart represents a willingness to explore potential relationships and an openness to finding love. 2. Wear the Ring on the Right Hand, Heart Facing Inward If you are in a relationship, you can convey that by wearing the Claddagh ring on the ring finger of your right hand, with the heart pointing inward, towards your body. In this position, the heart signifies that it has been claimed by someone and demonstrates that the wearer has made a commitment to their partner. The heart facing inward represents the emotional connection and devotion to another person, symbolizing a strong bond between the wearer and their partner. Beyond Relationship Status: Other Uses of the Claddagh Ring Beyond signaling one's relationship status, the Claddagh ring is also worn for other purposes in various contexts. The Claddagh ring is often used as a friendship ring, presented from one friend to another as a symbol of loyalty, trust, and support in their relationship. Additionally, it's common for the ring to be adopted as an engagement or wedding band, handed down through generations as a family heirloom, or given as a meaningful gift representing the promise of love, friendship, and loyalty. Conclusion The Claddagh ring's rich history and symbolism make it a timeless piece of art that transcends cultural boundaries. Its subtle codes provide a unique and eloquent way for people to communicate their relationship status without explicitly announcing it. Whether worn to signify one's search for love, a loving relationship, or a testament to loyalty and friendship, the Claddagh ring remains an enchanting emblem of human bonds and connects us to the shared values of love, friendship, and loyalty across the world."},{"prompt":"Read the bio below and try to give details on rolinha kross 's: - image - genre - name - background - website Bio: rolinha kross -lrb- born 16 june 1961 -rrb- is a dutch singer with a jewish/czech mother and a surinamese father . from an early age , she was fascinated by eastern european music and the yiddish language . she performed with various groups , a.o. with her mother , ilona cechova , under the name \`\` sense '' . she followed the vocalprogram in jazz and light music at the conservatory in hilversum -lrb- now in amsterdam -rrb- . immediately after the academy , she went on tour with the musical \`\` you 're the top '' , with willem nijholt in the lead . meanwhile she worked with klezmokum , solomon klezmorim and various jazz ensembles . the rolinha kross trio , together with bokkie vink and theo van tol , recorded an album \`\` tsigayner klezmer '' . many performances followed at home and abroad , among them canada and curaçao . a tour with ramses shaffy along theaters in the netherlands and belgium proceeded together with a production of ira gershwin with ernst daniël smid , mathilde santing en denise jannah . subsequently , rolinha worked together with the klezmer group mazzeltov , with whom she performed often at home and abroad , and recorded four albums . with mazzeltov rolinha performed three times at the concertgebouw in amsterdam . recently , rolinha plays in the musical performance \`\` iberia '' which she and perry dossett developed . with guitarist harold berghuis she delivers a program of yiddish poetry -lrb- translated by willy brill -rrb- that they have put to music . she often performs as a guest in the show of \`\` frank in person '' with jazz standards . on top of that , the newly created rolinha kross quartet brings dutch lyrics to gypsy jazz music . they are currently working on an album . rolinha kross regularly hosts singing workshops . her voice can be heard in commercials and commentary on documentaries .","completion":"- Image: Rolinha Kross is a Dutch singer of mixed Jewish/Czech and Surinamese heritage.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the song that was a top ten hit in the UK from the David Live album? Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur\\". According to playwright Alan...

Title: Not your average hip hop Review: As a long time hip-hop fan, it's hard not to be judgemental about the cookie cutter music being forced upon us. But just when I decide to retreat to my pre-1992 cocoon, I come across a dope artist that reminds me of why I love hip hop. Hip Hop Meditations gets back to hip hop's roots of drawing upon its surroundings and standing up for something beyond mere loot, which gets reflected here. Beyond the boom bap, Carlos draws heavily upon Afro-Cuban traditions, which considering hip hop's roots in the Caribbean, should be done more often. Speech from Arrested Development is a guest here, and I was intrigued enough to look him up and get reintroduced to a guy I thought had essentially retired from the game. (My bad). Carlos has a couple of new releases coming up soon featuring Zion I and Tre Hardson, formerly of the Pharcyde. I can hardly wait...

Paragraph: So it was that J.W. and Marty had come into the inner places of each other's lives. Of all the developments of Institute week, naturally the one which filled J.W.'s thoughts with a sort of awed gladness was Marty's decision to offer himself for the ministry. Joe Carbrook's right-about-face was much more dramatic, for J.W. saw, when the decision was made, that Marty could not have been meant for anything but a preacher. It was as fit as you please. As to Joe, previous opinion had been pretty equally divided; one side leaning to the idea that he might make a lawyer, and the other predicting that he was more likely to be a perpetual and profitable client for some other lawyer. In the light of the Institute happenings, it was to be expected that the question of college would promptly become a practical matter to four Delafield people. Marty was greatly troubled, for he knew if he was to be a preacher, he must go to college, and he couldn't see how. J.W. felt no great urge, though it had always been understood that he would go.

The reviewer starts with a positive statement about the quality of the coffee, noting that the mocha was \\"good & tasty.\\" They also compliment the service by mentioning that it was \\"friendly.\\" This establishes a pleasant base for the review which focuses on the two aspects most important to cafes: the drinks and service. However, it is crucial to consider the negatives mentioned in the review as well. The reviewer points out that the cafe is often crowded, with long lines and limited seating options. Even though this is a negative aspect, it indirectly implies that the cafe is popular, which tends to be an underlying positive. Additionally, the decor is described as \\"hip, urban industrial.\\" This statement conveys that the place has an appealing atmosphere, adding to the overall positive vibe of the review. Lastly, the reviewer brings up a concern about parking, expressing that it isn't convenient for people wanting to make quick visits. Nevertheless, this is a relatively minor inconvenience when compared to the multiple favorable points previously mentioned. In conclusion, the overall sentiment of the review leans more towards positive, as the most significant aspects of the cafe - the coffee and service - receive commendation. While there are some negatives mentioned (crowdedness and parking), they are relatively minor and don't outweigh the positives.

Please answer the following question: Article: Ever since Canadian psychiatrist Michael R. Phillips, who works in China, released his report saying China's suicide rate from 1995 to 1999 reached 0.023 percent, the country has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world. But Jing Jun, a professor of sociology in Tsinghua University, challenges that view and presents the true picture through his nationwide research. Jing and his students took one year to set up the first national database on suicide rate to grasp the overall trend of suicides in China. They collected data from the Health Statistics Annuals of the World Health Organization (sample size 10 million), and the country's Health Statistics Annuals (which cover 100 million people). The database covers 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. Jing calculates the suicide rate in China based on these data. Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world. According to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the \\"missing\\" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com] Jing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men. As a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further.

In the first sentence, the statement being made is that Oklahoma's jocks (referring to athletes) may be no denser (meaning not more stupid) than many of its other Republican politicians. This sentence suggests a comparison between two groups - athletes and politicians - and highlights a potential similarity in terms of intelligence or lack thereof. On the other hand, the second sentence makes a definitive and absolute claim that Republican politicians from Oklahoma are the dumbest. This sentence declares that this particular group of politicians is not just denser than the athletes or others but is in fact the dumbest amongst the wider population. Although the first sentence implies that the intelligence of Oklahoma's Republican politicians leaves something to be desired and compares it unfavorably to that of athletes, it does not directly entail the second sentence. The first sentence leaves room for other groups to also have similarly low intelligence, while the second sentence specifically establishes Republican politicians from Oklahoma as being the dumbest.

Question: Who performs poorly in this movie? Movie title: Goal! Movie plot: Santiago MuÃ±ez (Kuno Becker) is a skilled footballer. The son of a gardener who lives in a barrio section of Los Angeles, Santiago works as a busboy in a Chinese restaurant and helps with his father's (Tony Plana) gardening business. His ultimate dream is to play football professionally. Due to his poverty and the fact that he plays solely for a club made up of Hispanics from a local car wash, he feels his chances are slim. Santiago is noticed by Glen Foy (Stephen Dillane), a former Newcastle United player who works as a car mechanic but still has ties to his old team. Glen arranges to get Santiago a tryout with Newcastle United, who recently signed talented new player Gavin Harris (Alessandro Nivola). Needing to get to England, Santiago begins to save his money in an old shoe, but his father finds the stash and takes it to buy a GMC truck to allow them to work for themselves, believing that Santiago's dreams are hopeless. His dream is not lost though, as his grandmother (Miriam Colon) sells off her jewellery to buy him a ticket to England. Glen warmly welcomes Santiago to his home and takes him to the tryout. Unfamiliar with the English style, he performs poorly. Glen convinces the team's manager that Santiago needs a month's trial to show his full potential. Santiago does not tell club nurse, Roz Harmison (Anna Friel), that he has asthma. After a month, a jealous teammate crushes Santiago's inhaler before a reserve game. An asthma flare-up prevents him from being able to run hard, and his coach lets him go. While on his way to the airport Santiago meets Gavin Harris, who was late to arrive to the team. Harris finds out what has happened and makes Santiago explain it to the manager. The manager allows Santiago to stay, provided he gets treatment for the asthma. Santiago earns a contract for the reserves team and moves in with Gavin. Finally he gets onto the first team as a substitute in a match against Fulham. There he wins a penalty for Newcastle, which is taken by Gavin winning them the match. Unknown to...

I’d love to do a comedy with him. I just think it’d be fun for us to do something totally different than that,” she tells PEOPLE Now The actress went on to gush about Hamm’s comedy skills. “He’s so funny,” she said. “He’s one of my favorite SNL hosts ever. He is a true SNL nerd. He knew every one of the skits.” According to Spencer, Hamm was known for reenacting an SNL skit around the set. “He would just pull them out,” Spencer said. “Like, you know Maya Rudolph’s ‘Tiny Moves?’ He would just pull them out.” RELATED VIDEO: Warning!

Review: It's sort of hard for me to say it, because I so greatly enjoyed both \\"Targets\\" and \\"Paper Moon\\", but I thought \\"The Last Picture show\\" was a somewhat fascinating but overly self-indulgent film. Its main positive, as far as I'm concerned, is the stunning photography. But for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty (and a kind of hidden beauty, at that). The characters were very hard to relate to or to care about. Basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting, but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story, complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama -- everything from the boy cheating with his teacher's wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on. It was like \\"American Graffiti\\" without the joy of life. Some might say this film is more realistic -- nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess. But for me the film was simply oppressive, and I want to see it again about as badly as I'd like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in. Maybe this film really just belongs to its time -- perhaps if I'd seen it in 1971 I would have been impressed by its novelty, just by seeing something different on the screen. But that would basically assume that I had never seen anything like, say, Godard's \\"Breathless\\". Maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film's weaknesses. But in the post-Tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either. It is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth. We see 3 films as I recall in the picture show. First we see Vincente Minnelli's \\"Father of the Bride\\" -- Liz Taylor's exquisite looks provide a contrast to Sonny's girlfriend and Minnelli's studied upper-middle class milieu contrasts to the character's \\"real life\\" surroundings in a similar way. Later, clips from Howard Hawks' \\"Red River\\" emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a protégé. It really just reminds me that Bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor's butt, much as he did if I remember correctly by selecting a Hawks film as part of his own on-screen reverie with Boris Karloff in \\"Targets\\". I guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self-indulgent, like so much of the rest of this film. Ultimately, I'd rather see another film by Hawks, Ford or Minnelli than to have Bogdanovich's film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less-than-subtle way. Maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed -- all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation. Now, what is this review like? Available choices: (I). negative. (II). positive.","completion":"This review is (I). negative. Reasoning: The user found the film \\"The Last Picture Show\\" to be overly self-indulgent and largely formulaic. They felt the characters were hard to connect with and the plot was predictable. They also criticized the film's allusions to other movies as self-indulgent. While they acknowledged the film's strong photography, this was not enough to redeem the overall experience for them.

Answer choices: - nerves - heat energy - sound - binary code - light energy - Antennae. - megaphones - hand signals A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's go through the answer choices step by step: 1. Nerves: Nerves are responsible for transmitting signals and information within the ant's body, but not for external communication with other ants. 2. Heat energy: Ants don't use heat energy to communicate with each other. 3. Sound: Though ants can make some sounds by rubbing their body parts together, they primarily rely on other methods for communication. 4. Binary code: Binary code is a human-made method of encoding data and not applicable to ant communication. 5. Light energy: Ants don't use light energy to communicate with each other. 6. Antennae: This is the correct answer. Ants communicate with their antennae by using chemical signals called pheromones. Ants touch their antennae to pheromone trails or other ants to exchange information. 7. Megaphones: Megaphones are human-made communication devices and not relevant to ant communication. 8. Hand signals: Ants do not have hands; they have legs and antennae. So, the correct answer is antennae.

Answer:","completion":"The first black American to win the Nobel Peace Prize was Ralph Bunche. Born on August 7, 1903, in Detroit, Michigan, Ralph Johnson Bunche was an American political scientist, academic, and diplomat. He received the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 for his exceptional mediation efforts and success in negotiating peaceful agreements during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, particularly for the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Bunche was a trailblazer for black Americans as well as people of color worldwide. His accomplishments and accolades spanned various spheres, including education, diplomacy, and civil rights activism. He earned his undergraduate degree summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1927 and later completed his master's and doctorate degrees in government and international relations from Harvard University in 1928 and 1934, respectively. Bunche became the first black American to be awarded a PhD in political science from an American university. Throughout his illustrious career, Bunche held numerous significant positions in both academia and international diplomacy. He worked as a researcher and professor, teaching political science at universities such as Harvard, Northwestern, and Howard. Eventually, he transitioned to the world of diplomacy, where his expertise in colonization and racial conflict resolution was evidently instrumental in international conflict resolution efforts. In the early 1940s, Bunche served as an advisor to the U.S. State Department and played a vital role in creating the United Nations. As a participant in the 1945 San Francisco conference, he contributed to drafting the U.N. Charter, and later in that year, he joined the permanent staff of the United Nations as Head of the Trusteeship Division. Bunche's most significant achievement in diplomacy took place while working for the United Nations. In 1948, he was appointed as Principal Secretary of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) and later as Acting United Nations Mediator on Palestine. The following year, he played a pivotal role in securing the armistice agreements between Israel and the Arab States. As a direct consequence of these efforts, Ralph Bunche received the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1950. In the 1950s and 1960s, Bunche actively participated in the civil rights movement, working closely with prominent figures like Martin Luther King Jr. He held prestigious positions throughout his life, such as serving as Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, and actively engaged in global efforts to promote peace and combat racial discrimination. Ralph Bunche passed away on December 9, 1971, but left behind a legacy as a pioneering black American who dedicated his life to be an advocate for peace and equal rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been.

CONTEXT: Exhibición El cuerpo momificado se conservó inicialmente en Ancoats Hall, que era la casa de un miembro de la familia Beswick, aunque poco tiempo después fue trasladado a la casa del doctor White ubicada en Sale, donde fue almacenado en una vieja caja de reloj con la cara cubierta por un manto de terciopelo. La aparente excentricidad de Beswick la convirtió en una celebridad. El escritor Thomas de Quincey fue uno de muchos que acudieron a verla. Después de la muerte de White en 1813, el cuerpo de Beswick fue legado al doctor Ollier y tras la muerte de este en 1828, fue donado al Museo de la Sociedad de Historia Natural de Mánchester, establecido en 1835 en Peter Street, donde se dio a conocer como la Momia de Mánchester o la Momia de Birchin Bower.

Answer:","completion":"From the given bio of Saint Gangulphus of Burgundy, we can gather several details regarding his life, background, and the context of his martyrdom: 1. Time Period: Saint Gangulphus lived in the 8th century, as he died on May 11, 760 AD. His life occurred during the early medieval period. 2. Geographical Location: He belonged to the region of Burgundy, which is located in present-day France. 3. Religion: Saint Gangulphus is recognized as a martyr by the Catholic Church, which indicates that he was an adherent of the Catholic faith at the time. 4. Socio-economic Background: He was a courtier in the Burgundian court, depicting his high social standing during that period. The bio also mentions that his family dominated the region, showing that they exercised considerable power and influence. 5. Occupation and Lifestyle Transformation: Gangulphus was initially a great landowner with vast properties and wealth. However, he later decided to renounce his wealth and become a hermit, signifying a significant change in his lifestyle and values. 6. Historical Evidence: The historical existence of Saint Gangulphus can only be attested by a single document - a deed from the court of Pepin the Short dated 762. This indicates that there may be limited sources and evidence to provide a complete picture of his life. 7. Cause of Death: Gangulphus was killed by his wife's lover, who wished to remove him as a possible interference in their adulterous relationship. This implies that his death was the result of personal enmity and domestic issues rather than religious persecution or any political conflict. 8. Martyrdom: Despite the seemingly personal nature of his death, the Catholic Church venerates Gangulphus as a martyr, suggesting that his renunciation of wealth, devotion to his faith, and unjust murder are considered significant enough for him to be remembered and honored as a saint. Based on these details, the bio provides a glimpse into the life of Saint Gangulphus of Burgundy, highlighting his social standing, religious devotion, tumultuous personal life, and eventual martyrdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Initialize a variable, 'min_difference', to store the smallest absolute difference found so far. Set its initial value to the absolute difference between the first two numbers in the sorted list ('min_difference' = |-30 - (-14)| = 16) 3.

The final value of 'min_difference' will be the smallest possible absolute distance. Using this method, let's find the minimum absolute difference: - Initial min_difference: 16 - Absolute difference between -14 and -11: |-14 - (-11)| = 3 (min_difference is updated to 3) - Absolute difference between -11 and 60: |-11 - 60| = 71 (min_difference does not change, as 71 > 3) - Absolute difference between 60 and 94: |60 - 94| = 34 (min_difference does not change, as 34 > 3) After iterating through all the elements, the minimum absolute difference is found to be 3.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Where was the man who's musical career was interrupted in 1896 principal conductor in 1907? Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

Associate Athletics Director for Football Communications Jeff Purinton said a parent of a current Crimson Tide player accidentally knocked over the crystal football, which was on display after Saturday's A-Day game inside the Mal Moore Athletic Facility. Purinton declined to disclose who sent the football tumbling from its perch. Purinton said Alabama is in the initial stages of figuring out how to replace the trophy, which is made entirely of Waterford Crystal and is valued at 30,000. Alabama fans received opportunities to pose next to the trophy throughout the offseason at various sites across the state. Before Saturday's scrimmage, hundreds of fans had their pictures snapped with it under a canopy outside Gate 5 of Bryant-Denny Stadium. This isn't the first time a school has been forced to replace its championship trophy.

Athletic department spokesman Jeff Purinton said the Waterford Crystal trophy, valued at 30,000, was on display in the Mal Moore Athletic Facility as part of the festivities for the Crimson Tide's spring football game Saturday in Tuscaloosa, Ala. He says the man stumbled on a rug that was under the trophy display. Purinton said the school is working with the American Football Coaches Association, which owns the trophy, on getting a replacement. Florida's 2006 trophy was destroyed when it was accidentally knocked off a pedestal by a recruit in 2008. In 2004, Florida State had two trophies stolen. \\"In 2009 and again this season, Alabama did a great job showing the trophy off to fans even after we turned it over to them,\\" said Charley Green, manager of the coaches' trophy. \\"Unfortunately it is fragile, and accidents can happen. Green said the trophy makes appearances for several weeks before it is turned over to the school in mid-January. \\"We use a temporary adhesive called museum gel to keep the crystal from falling off its pegs,\\" he said. \\"We do provide that substance to winning schools, along with a page of assembly instructions.

Answer:","completion":"General Average Sacrifice is a maritime law principle that refers to the intentional and voluntary sacrifice of a part of a ship's cargo, equipment, or any other belongings in order to preserve the overall safety of the vessel, its crew, and the remaining cargo during an emergency or in the face of a perilous situation. This principle can be traced back to ancient maritime laws and has since been recognized and incorporated into many modern legal systems. The response provided, \\"2nd. There must be a voluntary jettison, jactus, or casting away, of some portion of the joint concern for the purpose of avoiding this imminent peril, periculi imminentis evitandi causa, or, in other words, a transfer of the peril from the whole to a particular portion of the whole.\\" is an explanation of the principle referring to the conditions under which the sacrifice is made. The rationale behind the General Average Sacrifice is to acknowledge the fact that in dire situations, it may be necessary to sacrifice a part of the ship or its cargo to save the rest of the ship, its crew, and the remaining cargo, and even to prevent the potential for a greater loss. When a General Average Sacrifice occurs, the losses incurred as a result of the sacrifice are to be shared proportionally by all the parties involved, such as shipowners, charterers, and cargo owners. To qualify as a General Average Sacrifice, the following conditions must be met: 1. Imminent Peril: The situation must involve a real, tangible, and imminent threat to the safety of the vessel, its crew, or the cargo on board. 2. Voluntary and Reasonable Sacrifice: The decision to sacrifice a part of the ship or its cargo must be voluntary and based on rational assessment of the situation, ideally by a responsible person such as the ship's captain or a relevant authority. The sacrifice should be of a portion of the joint concern and made with the aim of avoiding the imminent danger. 3. Benefit to All Parties: The sacrifice must have the intention and effect of benefiting all the parties involved in the maritime venture. In other words, the sacrifice should have a measurable positive outcome towards preserving the safety of the ship, cargo, or crew. 4. Proper Sharing of Losses: The losses resulting from the sacrifice should be shared proportionally among all the parties involved, based on their respective interests in the venture. In conclusion, the response provided is a reasonable explanation of the General Average Sacrifice, specifically addressing the intentional and voluntary act of casting away a portion of the joint concern to prevent an imminent peril. However, it should be noted that this is just one of the various conditions that need to be met in order to classify an incident as a General Average Sacrifice. A full understanding of the principle requires considering all the conditions mentioned for a sacrifice to be recognized as a General Average, and how the losses are to be shared among the involved parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reyes was arrested in Maui on Oct. 31 after he allegedly beat and shoved his wife, Katherine Ramirez in a hotel room, according to a police report. Ramirez had told police that Reyes grabbed her throat and shoved her through a sliding glass door during an argument in their hotel room. Hotel employees reported that Ramirez had injuries to her neck, wrist and thighs. Reyes pleaded not guilty but the criminal charges were soon dropped after lack of cooperation from Ramirez. He was placed on paid administrative leave by MLB as they conducted their own investigation. Reyes is owed 44 million over the next two seasons on his current contract, but it remains possible the Rockies could cut Reyes once the suspension is announced.

When Jack orders them to surrender, Brock pulls out a gun and starts firing and Jack kills Brock in self-defense as Burroughs escapes. Among those who show up at the scene are fellow cops Ben Kehoe and Frank Cruise, and also Blake Wilson, the head of the Internal Affairs division. Cates tells Wilson that he shot Brock in self-defense as Brock had opened fire on him. Cruise picks up a burnt piece of twisted metal but says that he can't find Brock's gun. Jack, however finds a partly burnt picture of Reggie Hammond in Brock's bag. Jack then goes to visit Reggie in prison, with Reggie due for release in 24 hours. After getting hit in the face with a basketball by Reggie for refusing to promise Reggie his 500,000 unless Reggie helps him find the Ice Man, Jack discovers that Wilson plans to prosecute him on a charge of third degree manslaughter for the Arthur Brock shooting, with Wilson claiming that it was not self-defence and Jack is placed on suspension. Wilson also does not believe that the Iceman exists and believes Jack is wasting department resources looking for him. After Reggie is released from prison, bikers Richard \\"Cherry\\" Ganz, the brother of Albert Ganz, and Willie Hickok from the Brotherhood who had earlier killed two highway patrol officers and a bartender at a bar out in the desert, pull up beside the prison bus and open fire on Reggie, causing the bus to crash. Ganz and Hickok then pull up to a diner where Ganz shoots Jack who is sitting inside. Jack and Reggie end up at the same hospital where it is revealed that Jack was wearing a bullet proof vest and Reggie had escaped the hit with nothing more than a bump on his head. Jack then convinces the attending police officers to release Reggie into his custody by telling them that he is needed to identify the Kingpin of a child pornography ring. After...

The account given in Acts of the Apostles, which says Jesus remained with the apostles for forty days, appears to differ from the account in the Gospel of Luke, which makes no clear distinction between the events of Easter Sunday and the Ascension.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. It is a consequence of the way sunlight is scattered by haze particles, say scientists. The US space agency probe continues to downlink the information gathered during its historic flyby of the dwarf planet on 14 July. As this data arrives on Earth, the team processes it and studies it. A black and white image of the hazes was previously released, showing them to be as high as 130km above Pluto's surface. That picture came from the Lorri camera and was acquired as New Horizons departed the dwarf, looking back to see sunlight skim the edge of the distant world. This new view comes from the Ralph colour camera system. Again, it is taken with Pluto backlit. Like Earth, the dwarf has a predominantly nitrogen atmosphere (albeit much more spare). But it is the interaction of this nitrogen with the Sun's ultraviolet light, in presence of another atmospheric constituent, methane, that is able to create the chunky haze particles. \\"That striking blue tint tells us about the size and composition of the haze particles,\\" said New Horizons team member Carly Howett from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. \\"A blue sky often results from scattering of sunlight by very small particles. On Earth, those particles are very tiny nitrogen molecules. On Pluto they appear to be larger - but still relatively small - soot-like particles we call tholins.\\" The principal investigator on the mission, Alan Stern, had teased Pluto fans in recent days, telling them to expect something special from this week's regular Thursday release of new images. \\"Who would have expected a blue sky in the Kuiper Belt? It's gorgeous,\\" he said in a Nasa statement. If you stood on Pluto and looked straight up, the sky would actually appear black because of the rarity of the atmosphere. \\"The haze is pretty thin, so you'd mostly see the colour of the haze as blue sunrises and sunsets,\\" Dr Howett explained to BBC News. The other important piece of news to come out concerns the detection of water-ice at many locations on the 2,300km-wide dwarf's surface. More volatile ices tend to dominate the surface, so understanding why the water-ice is seen strongly in some places is an interesting observation that will need to be followed up, the team says. \\"We expected water-ice to be there, but we've searched for water-ice in Pluto's spectrum for decades and not seen it before now,\\" tweeted Alex Parker, also from SwRI. Since 14 July, New Horizons has moved more than 100 million km beyond Pluto. And this puts it about five billion km from Earth. The vast separation makes for very low data rates. It will be well into 2016 before all the information is on the ground.

Steven Ellison (born October 7, 1983), known by his stage name Flying Lotus or sometimes FlyLo, is an experimental multi-genre music producer, electronic musician, DJ, filmmaker, and rapper from Los Angeles, California. Flying Lotus has released five studio albums--1983 (2006), Los Angeles (2008), Cosmogramma (2010), Until the Quiet Comes (2012) and You're Dead! (2014)--to critical acclaim. At his mother's house, Ellison saw an advertisement on Adult Swim/Cartoon Network asking for song submissions. He sent some in, under the name Flying Lotus (a moniker inspired by lucid dreaming) and was accepted. Around this time, he was interning at the pioneering hip hop label Stones Throw Records. Days were spent in their offices, and nights were spent at his grandmothers, working on the music that would become his debut album: 1983. The record (released on LA indie label Plug Research) was an early touchstone for Ellison's eclectic creative mission, forging compressed, spacey and Eastern sounding hip-hop beats, that summoned Madlib as much as Dntel, while sampling as far back as 70s Japanese proto-synthpop and 60s jazz harp. It would also feature Laura Darlington, who went on to become a vocal fixture of future albums. In 2006, Ellison participated in that year's annual Red Bull Music Academy, which took place in Melbourne, Australia. In 2007, he announced on CSU-Fullerton's Titan Radio that he signed with Warp Records (home to Prefuse 73, Autechre, Boards of Canada, and Aphex Twin). Following his Warp debut, the six-track Reset EP, he quickly became one of the label's cornerstone artists and released his second studio album, titled Los Angeles, on June 10, 2008. His first release on Warp, Reset EP, gave his new audience a taste of the steady grooves and darker breaks that had earned him the move. As Ellison's profile rose, he decided to commandeer the limelight by launching his own label, Brainfeeder, to house his friends (Samiyam, Ras G, etc.) and unite a large section of the LA beat scene under one label.

The information provided in the premise is centered around Clinton's actions involving Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Israel in the context of the peace process. The two key actions mentioned in the premise include: 1) Rolling out the carpet to enhance Arafat's prestige: This statement implies that Clinton was trying to increase Arafat's reputation and standing by offering him a warm reception and support. This can be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen Arafat's position in delicate peace negotiations and promote a peaceful resolution between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. 2) Sending Israel a warning not to screw up the peace process by provoking further conflict: Clinton's actions are also clearly focused on ensuring that Israel remains committed to the peace process and does not engage in behaviors that could disrupt progress or escalate tensions. This statement conveys the importance the Clinton administration placed on the peace process and their willingness to address any potential threats to its success. Given this context, the hypothesis involving North Korea is not supported by the premise. It is important to note that the premise does not mention North Korea or any other country beyond Palestine and Israel.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who accidentally puts the diaper on while the baby crawls off? Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again, and fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never did enter the mixer but instead playing with a hammer. The baby then playfully bonks Tom on the head. A:","completion":"Tom accidentally puts the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A 16-year-old boy finds himself on a boat in the Pacific Ocean after escaping a shipwreck . Even worse, he is left with a huge tiger for company. But he manages to survive after 227 days of fighting against all the hardships of the sea. Pi, the lead character in Oscar-winning Ang Lee's new movie Life of Pi, went through an inspiring journey of growth and self-discovery. So did 19-year-old Suraj Sharma, the Indian actor who plays him. But it was a lucky chance that opened up the opportunity for the new star. Sharma was a regular student who lived with his mathematician parents in Delhi, India. As the director traveled to Mumbai to find his Pi, the teenager went along with his younger brother, who had acted in a couple of movies, to audition . But little did Sharma know that he would end up winning the role from 3, 000 hopefuls. Lee said he saw Pi in Sharma: \\"Not only does he have a compelling and wise look. He has this rare talent.\\" The director said that in the final round, Sharma gave one of the \\"most compelling readings we had. In the end, he was in tears.\\" Understandably, Sharma didn't want to _ . \\"He (Lee) had given me this opportunity. I had to give it my best,\\" Sharma told the Philippine Daily Inquirer.

Each state has different requirements for becoming a real estate agent or broker. Before you begin undergoing the necessary training, make sure you meet the basic requirements. In Washington, in order to be a real estate agent you must: Be at least 18 years of age Have at least a high school diploma or the equivalent, such as a GED You will have to engage in nearly two years of education to get your real estate license in Washington. Use that time to your advantage to gain experience in the field. While not directly related to obtaining your license, certain experiences are invaluable to your success as an agent. Try to get an internship or office job in a real estate firm. Even an administrative position that seems only tangentially related to buying and selling houses can teach you hard work and give you a sense of what the industry is like. Not to mention, if you make a good impression on someone in the industry you could snag a job after you get your license. Ask an experienced real estate agent if you can shadow them for a day or week to see what the industry is like just to make sure this career path is really for you. In Washington, there are specific educational requirements you must complete before taking the real estate exam. Make sure the courses you enroll in are approved by the Washington State Department of Licensing. If you're unsure if a class is approved, give the Department of Licensing a call during office hours just to be sure. You don't want to invest time and money in a course that won't be accepted when you apply to take the exam. A list of approved curriculum is found on the Washington Department of Licensing website, as well as some approved schools. Classes are available online, through colleges such as Kaplan, and in-person at universities and community colleges. Find a route that works for you and enroll. Fees vary from program to program, but tuition can cost as much as 300. Be prepared to spend some money during the process of obtaining your license. You must complete 90 total hours of coursework within a 2-year time frame. These courses are extensive and demanding, so be prepared to commit. Your 90 hours include a 60-hour course in real estate fundamentals. This course is an overview of the real estate trade. You will learn about various real estate firms and what they do in communities. You will learn about policies like contract laws, fair housing laws, property ownership rights, and listing agreements. There's also an extensive overview of the buying and selling process, and a good deal of basic real estate vocabulary you must commit to memory. The additional 30 hours are comprised of a course in real estate practices. Here, you will learn about basic business skills and procedures in the real estate world. You will learn how to evaluate, price, and market property as well as a variety of negotiation and sales techniques. You will also learn about the closing process and how to conduct real estate math. The state exam is hard. Knowing the information and having completed the necessary coursework does not guarantee you will pass. The structure of the questions and specific vocabulary can throw even the most well-researched test taker. Exam prep, whether through software or a test prep class, can help you get a passing score on the real estate exam. Free practice exams are available online, but are not subject to as rigorous review as paid courses and prep work. Online universities offer test prep courses for a variety of state real estate exams, including Washington. Self-guided exam prep guides are available for purchase online, which include information on the format of the test, information you'll need to know, and a variety of practice exams. You can purchase exam prep books, either on Amazon or from a local bookstore, that help with real estate test prep. However, make sure you get the most recent edition as real estate exams are subject to change. Going to a used bookstore is not the best option if you're going the book route, as you're likely to find a dated exam guide. Summary:","completion":"1.

The two topics are unrelated, so the statement is not the correct answer to your question. Huo Guang, a renowned Chinese statesman and politician, was born in 110 BC and died in 68 BC. He served during the Western Han dynasty of China and played a crucial role in consolidating the rule of Emperor Wu. Following the death of Emperor Wu, Huo Guang acted as a regent for three successive emperors. He was instrumental in preserving the stability of the Western Han dynasty, particularly through his vision and outstanding political skills. Now, to address the statement you provided: \\"The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han.\\" This statement refers to the monopolies on industries imposed by Emperor Wu during his reign. Emperor Wu actively initiated various state monopolies, including the liquor, salt, and iron industries, as a means to increase the revenue for the Western Han government and enforce his expansionist policy. The liquor monopoly indeed lasted from 98 to 81 BC, whereas the salt and iron monopolies were abolished during the early Eastern Han period, which began in 25 AD when the Western Han dynasty was usurped by the Xin dynasty (9-23 AD). To summarize, Huo Guang died in the year 68 BC, and the statement you provided cannot be an answer to this question.

I had seen it before, those fuzzy, furry leaves and stalks, with the pretty, star-pointed purple flowers, but up until that moment that I saw them sitting in a basket at the market stalls, I admit I had never taken notice of it as a food. It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there’s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones. Or you can simply deep fry the clusters of buds that haven’t yet burst open like these deep-fried robinia flowers. borage and ricotta crepes The problem, I was thinking, as I took home my bag of borage, is that I can’t decide what to make. There’s simply too much choice. I consulted two of my favourite books that also happen to be cookbooks. Patience Gray’s Honey from a Weed and Luigi Ballerini’s A Feast of Weeds. Both had wonderful ideas for borage (and indeed many other edible, foraged plants). The cooking probably took - two hours - an hour - a day - not enough information","completion":"In Patience Gray's Honey from a Weed, she mentions using young borage leaves in a frittata, simply by combining them with eggs and a little seasoning. She also writes about making a soup with borage, potatoes, and leeks, blending everything together with the addition of a little cream to finish it off. The soup is said to have a fresh, delicious flavor, not unlike leek and potato soup, but with a hint of the cucumber-like taste that borage is known for. In Luigi Ballerini's A Feast of Weeds, he suggests making borage and ricotta crepes. The recipe involves making a simple crepe batter, combining the cooked and chopped borage leaves with ricotta cheese and a pinch of nutmeg, and then spooning the mixture into the crepes, folding them into packets, and baking them in the oven until heated through and slightly crispy on the edges. Ballerini's recipe also calls for serving the crepes with a drizzle of melted butter and Parmesan cheese, a classic and decadent Italian touch. After spending some time browsing through these two cookbooks and contemplating the many possible uses for borage in my dishes, I decided to go ahead and try making the borage and ricotta crepes. The result was wonderful - the crepes were light and delicate, while the filling was creamy and packed with the unique flavor of borage. The process of making the crepes and the filling took about two hours, from start to finish. This included the time spent cleaning and blanching the borage leaves, which can take some time due to their fuzzy and slightly prickly nature. It's important to choose young, fresh leaves for this type of preparation, as they are more tender and less prickly than older leaves. It wasn't the quickest of meals to prepare, but it was well worth the effort. As I enjoyed my borage and ricotta crepes with a simple green salad and a glass of white wine, I couldn't help but think of how fortunate I was to have stumbled upon this versatile and delicious plant. The fact that it grows wild in my own backyard makes it even more special, as it's a constant reminder of the beauty and abundance of nature, and the many culinary delights that can be enjoyed if we just take the time to explore and embrace the natural world around us. In the end, my foray into cooking with borage turned out to be a wonderful experience, one that left me with a newfound appreciation for this unassuming, yet delightful plant. I now look forward to trying even more recipes and preparations using borage, with the goal of incorporating it into my culinary repertoire on a regular basis. Whether it's in ravioli or gnudi, soups or frittatas, or simply as a garnish for a refreshing cocktail, borage is a plant that certainly deserves a place at the table."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After three days in Washington, D.C., where we heard from Hillary Clinton, CEOs like Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo PEP and Carol Bartz of Yahoo yhoo , Warren Buffett brk.a , and even the President of the United States, I was feeling practically invincible. After the Summit, I took the train back home to Philadelphia. You won’t believe what happened when I arrived at 30th Street Station. I can’t find my car. So I walk all six floor in the garage with my luggage, black bag with all my heavy files, heels and a hot pink yoga mat that I had gotten at the Summit. I walk ALL six floors again with my luggage, black bag with all my heavy files, heels and the hot pink yoga mat. So I go to security and explain my issue. Velma, the security guard on duty, offers to search the garage with me, and when I ask if I can leave my stuff while we do that, she says “Not if you want to see it when you get back.” Okay. So Velma walks me all six floors with my luggage, black bag with all my heavy files, heels and the hot pink yoga mat. No car. (By the way, Velma was eyeing my hot pink yoga mat.) Velma calls Tyrone, her manager. Tyrone comes and tells me that people are always losing their cars because they think they drove up the ramp when they really drove down the ramp. He repeats this point as he drives me up and down the ramps in his 1972 Chevrolet with his muffler dragging and… So we call the police and report it stolen. Now I am upset but being cool about it, even though my car, a 2010 BMW 550 GT, is seven months old and has my razzle-dazzle camera with my expensive lens in the trunk and I feel invaded. This is my first big girl car (no more Mom SUV). Two hours and lots of paperwork later, I call my husband, Dominic. I didn’t want to get him concerned.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the subgenre of music that can range from soulful to minimalistic that is based around squelchy, deep electronic tones? , can you please find it? House music is a genre of electronic dance music created by club DJs and music producers in Chicago in the early 1980s. Early house music was generally characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, which preceded and influenced it, as both were DJ and record producer-created dance music, house was more electronic and minimalistic. The mechanical, repetitive rhythm of house was one of its main components. Many house compositions were instrumental, with no vocals; some had singing throughout the song with lyrics; and some had singing but no actual words. House music developed in Chicago's underground dance club culture in the early 1980s, as DJs from the subculture began altering the pop-like disco dance tracks to give them a more mechanical beat and deeper basslines. As well, these DJs began to mix synth pop, rap, Latin, and even jazz into their tracks. Latin music, particularly salsa clave rhythm, became a dominating riff of house music. It was pioneered by Chicago DJs such as Chip E., and Steve Hurley. It was influenced by Chicago DJ and record producer Frankie Knuckles, the Chicago acid-house electronic music group Phuture, and the Tennessee DJ/producer Mr. Fingers. The genre was originally associated with the Black American LGBT subculture but has since spread to the mainstream. From its beginnings in the Chicago club and local radio scene, the genre spread internationally to London, then to American cities such as New York City and Detroit, and eventually globally.Chicago house music acts from the early to mid-1980s found success on the US dance charts on various Chicago independent record labels that were more open to sign local house music artists. These same acts also experienced some success in the United Kingdom, garnering hits in that country. Due to this success, by the late 1980s, Chicago house music acts suddenly found themselves being offered...

The band is currently composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Jason Bowld (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Michael Thomas, Jason James and Nick Crandle; the latter were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. In an interview, Matt Tuck said that Bullet for My Valentine were going to start work on a new album before the Rule Britannia Tour which took place between 1 December 2013 till the 6 December 2013 in which the band played arenas in Britain supported by Young Guns and Asking Alexandria. In the interview Matt also said that they were strongly considering working with Terry Date, who has worked with bands such as Pantera and Deftones. He also said the band would bring back the thrash metal elements from Scream Aim Fire. In November 2013, Bullet for My Valentine revealed though their Facebook page they were working on a new song. A short snippet of the song, titled \\"Raising Hell,\\" was released on Matt Tuck's Vine profile on the 15th. The song was first played three days later via BBC Radio 1's Rock Show. It was made available for streaming and a music video for the song was released a week later. In 2014, Matt announced on Twitter that the band were entering the studio to record a fifth album. On August 28th, the band appeared on paranormal television show Most Haunted for an investigation at the Newton House in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire. In an interview with Kerrang! on 21 January 2015, Matt revealed that Bullet for My Valentine will be hitting the studio next month with producer Colin Richardson who produced both The Poison and Scream Aim Fire, rather than Terry Date, who was the suggested producer initially. Tuck also said that their fifth album will be their heaviest album yet. On 9 February 2015, Bullet for My Valentine announced the departure of bassist Jason James, adding that they would announce a replacement when they felt \\"the time was right.\\" They went on to say that until the announcement, they'd be busy and focused on recording their new record. It was announced on the band's Facebook page in 2015 that a new song, \\"No Way Out,\\" would debut on BBC Radio 1 on 17 May 2015. The band also revealed their fifth studio album to be titled Venom and their new bassist was going to be Jamie Mathias, formerly of metal band Revoker. Venom was set for release on 14 August 2015, the same day an expansive UK tour was announced.

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Paragraph: Bimmy and Harold are both four years old and are about to start attending school. Before that though, it is important that they have adequate supplies to be prepared. Bimmy's parents, who both have worn glasses their whole lives, took him to the store to pick up folders and pencils. While there, they bumped into Harold and his parents, who do not wear glasses.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation 84*p - 5 = 83*p for p, we need to isolate p on one side of the equation by performing some algebraic manipulations. Here's the step-by-step process: 1. Write down the original equation: 84*p - 5 = 83*p 2. To start isolating \\"p\\", move all terms containing \\"p\\" to one side of the equation. In this case, we'll subtract 83*p from both sides. This will leave us with the following equation: (84*p - 83*p) - 5 = 0 3. Now, simplify the equation by combining like terms. Since 84*p and -83*p both have \\"p\\" in them, we can combine them: (84 - 83)*p - 5 = 0 1*p - 5 = 0 4. Now, let's move the constant term to the other side of the equation to completely isolate \\"p\\". In this equation, the constant term is -5. To move it to the other side, add 5 to both sides of the equation: 1*p = 5 5. Lastly, to find the value of \\"p\\", divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \\"p\\", which in this case is 1: p = 5 / 1 Therefore, the solution to the equation 84*p - 5 = 83*p is: p = 5"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It's not yet clear how many other cases — including the 400 inmates on the state's death row — could be affected, experts said. “The substance of the ruling would affect the vast majority of Florida’s death row inmates,\\" said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment. \\"The remaining question would be: Will the Supreme Court consider this to have retroactive effect and retroactive to when?” He said he expects the ruling will unleash a wave of litigation. “Every defendant in Florida whose death sentence was imposed in this matter will be challenging the constitutionality of his or her death sentence under Hurst,\\" Dunham said. Connie Fuselier, the mother of Hurst's victim, said she doesn’t care if he is executed at this point, but she can’t bear the thought of more legal proceedings. “It’s been hell,” she told NBC News. “When you get to thinking it’s over with, it starts all over again. It’s nerve-racking.” At one point during the many appeals the case has spawned, Fuselier said, she told the prosecutor she’d be satisfied with a sentence of life without parole. “I just want it over with. I want to know he has no more appeals,” she said. She said the case’s 17-year journey through the courts, with the rehashing of the gruesome details of her daughter’s death, has taken a toll on the family. “I have post-traumatic stress. I have depression,” she said. “It’s like the family evaporated. We’re all here, but it’s like we’re not.” ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — Florida's unique system for sentencing people to death is unconstitutional because it gives too much power to judges — and not enough to juries — to decide capital sentences, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. The 8-1 ruling said that the state's sentencing procedure is flawed because juries play only an advisory role in recommending death while the judge can reach a different decision. The decision could trigger new sentencing appeals from some of the 390 inmates on the Florida's death row, a number second only to California. But legal experts said it may apply only to those whose initial appeals are not yet exhausted. The court sided with Timothy Lee Hurst, who was convicted of the 1998 murder of his manager at a Popeye's restaurant in Pensacola. A jury divided 7-5 in favor of death, but a judge imposed the sentence. Florida's solicitor general argued that the system was acceptable because a jury first decides if the defendant is eligible for the death penalty. Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said a jury's \\"mere recommendation is not enough.\\" She said the court was overruling previous decisions upholding the state's sentencing process. \\"The Sixth Amendment requires a jury, not a judge, to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death,\\" Sotomayor said. The justices sent the case back to the Florida Supreme Court to determine whether the error in sentencing Hurst was harmless, or whether he should get a new sentencing hearing. Justice Samuel Alito dissented, saying that the trial judge in Florida simply performs a reviewing function that duplicates what the jury has done. Under Florida law, the state requires juries in capital sentencing hearings to weigh factors for and against imposing a death sentence. But the judge is not bound by those findings and can reach a different conclusion. The judge can also weigh other factors independently. So a jury could base its decision on one particular aggravating factor, but a judge could then rely on a different factor the jury never considered. In Hurst's case, prosecutors asked the jury to consider two aggravating factors: the murder was committed during a robbery and it was \\"especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.\\" But Florida law did not require the jury to say how it voted on each factor. Hurst's attorney argued that it was possible only four jurors agreed with one, while three agreed with the other. Sotomayor said Florida's system is flawed because it allows a sentencing judge to find aggravating factors \\"independent of a jury's fact-finding.\\" The Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that a defendant has the right to have a jury decide whether the circumstances of a crime warrant a sentence of death. Florida is one of only three states that do not require a unanimous jury verdict when sentencing someone to death. The others are Alabama and Delaware. Stephen Harper, a law professor who runs the Death Penalty Clinic at Florida International University, said it's unlikely the Supreme Court ruling will open the door for most Florida death-row inmates to new sentencing hearings. He said the Florida decision is based on a previous Arizona ruling that was already found not to be retroactive. \\"In general, it will not be retroactively applied,\\" Harper said. But he added that Florida inmates whose initial appeals have not been exhausted may be able to argue that the latest decision applies to them. And, he said, any capital cases that are awaiting trial would likely be delayed while state legislators and the Florida Supreme Court sort out the next steps. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said her office is reviewing the ruling. News of the high court's decision stunned Florida legislators. Florida House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, who learned of the ruling while he was giving a speech to open the state's annual legislative session, said the Supreme Court had \\"impeccable timing.\\" Crisafulli said House legal experts would begin to review the ruling. Rep. Matt Gaetz, an attorney who has dealt with capital punishment during his legislative career, predicted that Florida legislators would act swiftly to get the death penalty \\"right back on track.\\" Cassandra Stubbs, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Capital Punishment Project, said the ruling \\"restored the central role of the jury in imposing the death penalty.\\" She called it another step toward ending capital punishment since juries across the country have been increasingly reluctant to impose death sentences. ___ Associated Press writers Curt Anderson in Miami, Gary Fineout in Tallahassee, Florida, and Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida, contributed to this report. ||||| The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down Florida's death penalty system on the grounds that judges, not juries, decide the key facts that determine whether a killer is condemned to die. In an 8-1 ruling, the justices said this judge-driven system violates a defendant's right to a jury trial. The ruling will likely give new sentencing hearings to inmates who were recently sentenced to death in Florida, but the justices in the past have said such new rulings do not apply automatically to old cases. Tuesday's ruling relied on a 2002 decision that struck down Arizona's judge-driven system for deciding death penalty cases. Despite that ruling in the case of Ring vs. Arizona, the Florida courts had continued to uphold death sentences there on the grounds that juries had recommended death as the proper verdict. But on Tuesday, the justices decided Florida must move to a sentencing system that gives juries the final word. The ruling will mean a new sentencing hearing for Timothy Hurst, who was convicted of stabbing and killing a a co-worker at a Popeye's restaurant in 1998. Join the conversation on Facebook >> He was tried twice, and the jury, though divided, recommended a death sentence, and the judge imposed one. But Justice Sonia Sotomayor, speaking for the court, said Florida should have followed the 2002 decision by putting the full weight on the jury. \\"The 6th Amendment protects a defendant's right to an impartial jury,\\" she said. \\"This right required Florida to base Timothy Hurst's death sentence on a jury verdict, not a judge's fact-finding. Florida's death sentencing scheme, which required the judge alone to find the existence of an aggravating circumstance, is therefore unconstitutional.\\" Dissenting alone, Justice Samuel A. Alito said the justices had upheld Florida's system in the past. \\"Under the Florida system, the jury plays a critically important role,\\" he said, by weighing the evidence and recommending whether the murderer should die.

The 8-1 ruling says that the state's sentencing procedure is flawed as juries play only an advisory role in recommending death while the judge can reach a separate decision. The decision could result in new sentencing appeals from some of the 390 inmates on Florida's death row."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to the audience, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself? from the following article ? Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.

Does the answer correctly answer the question Choose from: -- yes. -- no.","completion":"Yes, game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies primarily due to the lack of native land mammals in regions like New Zealand. These societies aimed to enhance the biodiversity of their respective regions by importing and acclimating foreign species to local environments. However, the introduction of game animals by these societies had both positive and negative consequences. In the 19th century, European settlers in countries like New Zealand and Australia founded acclimatisation societies with the primary objective of making these newly settled lands more familiar and comfortable. Adding game animals to the local ecology not only provided settlers with recreational hunting opportunities but also an additional source of food, leading to increased self-sufficiency. This is evidenced by the introduction of various animals like rabbits, deer, pheasants, and trout to the islands of New Zealand. Acclimatisation societies took great care in selecting the species to be introduced and closely monitored their progress in adapting to their new environments. However, these societies failed to predict the long-term ecological consequences of introducing new and, in many cases, invasive species to ecosystems that had developed in isolation over thousands of years. In many instances, the introduction of game animals caused irreversible damage to local habitats and led to the decline or even extinction of indigenous flora and fauna. In New Zealand, for example, the introduction of rabbits, possums, and stoats led to widespread devastation of local ecosystems, causing significant loss of native vegetation and bird life. These invasive species, which had no natural predators in their new environments, multiplied rapidly and overwhelmed the native species for resources, ultimately leading to imbalanced ecosystems and the disruption of natural food chains. In conclusion, game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies in countries like New Zealand to create a sense of familiarity for European settlers, provide recreational hunting opportunities, and increase self-sufficiency through alternative food sources. While these initiatives were successful in their aims, they also resulted in unforeseen ecological consequences, disrupting ecosystems and threatening the existence of native species. Today, many conservation efforts are focused on mitigating the damage caused by these introduced game animals and restoring local ecosystems to their former balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does loud noises often do to mammals?\\" is \\"comfort them\\", given that loud noises can cause mammals to startle? Answer:","completion":"No, I would not agree that the right answer to the question \\"what does loud noises often do to mammals?\\" is \\"comfort them.\\" On the contrary, loud noises typically cause discomfort, stress or even fear in mammals. This is because loud noises can be perceived as a potential threat or danger in their environment, leading them to startle or display other defensive behaviors. Furthermore, mammals have evolved to be sensitive to loud noises as a survival mechanism. This sensitivity allows them to effectively respond to potential threats, such as predators or natural events like storms or avalanches. Consequently, loud noises can trigger a \\"fight or flight\\" response in many mammals, increasing their heart rate, adrenaline production, and other physiological changes that help them quickly respond to perceived danger. In general, loud noises are more likely to cause stress, discomfort, or fear in mammals rather than providing any sense of comfort or relaxation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A documentary about two rocks bands, spanning a number of years. Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols. What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure. Anton Newcombe, the main man of Brian Jonestown Massacre, is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues, his friends and rivals the Dandy Warhols, but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him. Sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world. Newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience (getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan). Newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments, writes and produces all BJM's music, can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day, has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius, but is also a heavy drugs user, flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity, orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life, and can blow deals as fast as he makes them. BJM go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise Newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable. The Warhols acknowledge their debt to Newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the Warhols have something that BJM don't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense, the real world, and their market  as a mixing pot of talent (even if much of it is distilled from guru Newcombe) and accessibility, they are the very definition of 'cool.' DiG! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy. At one point, Newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the Warhols (in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act')  only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against Newcombe. By the time the Dandy Warhols take off in Europe with hits like 'Every Day Should Be A Holiday' and 'Bohemian Like You', Newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated. BJM are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the Warhols get busted for drugs around the same time, let off with a warning, and even allowed to keep the grass. The wider appeal of DiG! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music. The downside is that it is still a documentary, however intimate, and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands. Newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius, and there are feint glimpses of this in the film, but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this. In the words of one of the band members: \\"In every spiritual tradition, you burn in hell for pretending to be God and not being able to back it up.\\" Newcombe isn't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime, and DiG! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius.

Movie title: The Graduate Movie plot: The film explores the life of 21-year-old Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) shortly after earning his bachelor's degree from an unnamed college in the Northeast. The school is widely believed to be Williams College, Webb's alma mater (in the opening sequence of the movie, Dustin Hoffman, playing Benjamin Braddock, is wearing a Williams College tie). Benjamin is seen arriving at LAX International Airport over the opening credits.The movie really begins at a party that same evening celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in Pasadena, a suburb of Los Angeles. Benjamin is visibly uncomfortable at the party attended by his parents' friends. He remains aloof while his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. Benjamin escapes from each person who comes to congratulate him, exposing his seeming embarrassment at all the honors he had won at college. Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the neglected wife of his father's law partner, asks Benjamin to drive her home, which he reluctantly does. We never learn Mrs. Robinson's first name (or, indeed, the first names of any of Benjamin's and Elaine's parents) during the course of the film (in the novel, we are told that the initial of Mrs. Robinson's first name is G).Arriving at her home, she pleads for Benjamin to come inside, saying that she doesn't like to enter a dark house alone. Once inside, she forces a drink on him, and later exposes herself to him offering to have an affair with him. This scene, known as the \\"Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduce me\\" scene, as said by Benjamin, is said to be one of the most iconic scenes in the film. She, for no clear reason, does attempt to seduce him, removing her clothing. Mr. Robinson arrives home a few minute later, but does not see or suspect anything.

Bountiful food sources might have made Malaysia an inviting place for the contemporaries of Java Man — in 230,000 b.c. But thus far, the country's earliest traces of homo sapiens, found in the Niah Caves of northern Sarawak, are fragments of a skull dating to 40,000 b.c. On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Southeast Asia There are several theories to the Islamisation process in Southeast Asia. Another theory is trade. The expansion of trade among West Asia, India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen (Hadramout) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian, Arab-Singaporean, and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. The second theory is the role of missionaries or Sufis.[citation needed] The Sufi missionaries played a significant role in spreading the faith by introducing Islamic ideas to the region. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region. The ruler of the region's most important port, Malacca Sultanate, embraced Islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes.

The major non-communist Southern European countries joined a US-led military alliance (NATO) and formed the European Economic Community amongst themselves.

The founding member countries of the Warsaw Pact included the Soviet Union, Albania, Poland, Romania, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"If we closely examine both sentences, we can break them down to determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true. Sentence 1: \\"His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of its tether.\\" In this sentence, we have two pieces of information. Firstly, the suit is brown, and it is well cut. This means that the suit is designed and tailored in a flattering and stylish manner. The second part of this sentence, \\"perilously near the end of its tether,\\" suggests that the suit is close to its breaking point, meaning that it is significantly worn or damaged and may not be able to withstand much more use. Sentence 2: \\"His suit was well-cut, but worn.\\" In this sentence, we also have two pieces of information. Firstly, the suit is well-cut, which, like in the first sentence, means it is tailored in a well-designed and flattering manner. The second part of this sentence states that the suit is worn. This indicates that the suit has seen some use and is showing signs of wear and tear. Now, let's compare both sentences. The first part of each sentence, which refers to the suit being well-cut, is consistent. Both sentences agree that the suit has a good design and is tailored in a flattering manner. However, the second part of the sentences may seem to describe slightly different things. In Sentence 1, the suit is \\"perilously near the end of its tether,\\" which implies it is severely worn or damaged, whereas in Sentence 2, the suit is simply described as being \\"worn,\\" without the same emphasis on the extreme level of wear. That being said, we can still argue that the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Sentence 2 does not contradict any information provided in Sentence 1. If the brown suit in Sentence 1 is \\"perilously near the end of its tether,\\" it would indeed qualify as being worn, which is the description provided in Sentence 2. In conclusion, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence can also be considered true. The overall state of being \\"worn\\" in Sentence 2 can encompass the more detailed and severe state of wear described in Sentence 1, even if Sentence 2 does not explicitly mention the extent of the wear."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One TV show that has proved popular with hackers is NBC Universal's Mr Robot which centres around Elliott Alderson - a security pro by day but who is also a member of an anti-establishment hacker group called FSociety that wants to use his technical skills to change the world. Kor Adana, one of Mr Robot's writers who worked in IT security before jumping to TV production, said the decision to make the show as technically accurate as possible was made even before the first episode was shot. \\"I've got nothing but disdain for how Hollywood has portrayed hacking and technology before now,\\" he told a packed session at Def Con that was testament to the huge following Mr Robot has won among hackers. \\"We wanted to do it right,\\" he said, \\"and we thought that doing it in a realistic way would be enticing and compelling.\\" To help get the details correct, Mr Adana has recruited several technical consultants well-known in the Def Con and hacking community to advise on how the hacks Elliott uses can be accomplished. The consultants develop the hacks, prove they work and then pass on information about how they were done to Mr Adana so they can be used on the show. However, he said, drama demands that not every last detail of how Elliot cracks passwords, spoofs text messages, hacks phones or penetrates corporate and civil networks is shown. \\"We have to strike a balance between what's visually compelling and what we have to do to move the story forward,\\" he said. Despite this the show does take care to make sure real and relevant hardware and software is used, he said. This attention to detail extends to the version numbers of software packages being used, command syntax, output format and screen layouts. \\"We want to nail those details,\\" said Mr Adana. \\"It really helps to ground the show in reality if we can use real tools.\\" Mr Adana extended an open invitation to the Def Con audience to contact him and the technical consultants with information about the tools they use so they can be featured on the show and used in its hacks. Beyond the technology and hacks featured in the show, Mr Adana said it was also trying to make an important point about the contemporary role of technology. \\"We live in an age where we are more dependent on devices than ever,\\" he said. \\"And there are a lot of the younger generation that know how to use apps but do not know about the ways in which they are vulnerable and how if they leave their phone unlocked it will not take long for it to be rooted.\\" \\"If Mr Robot increases the level of awareness and paranoia out there then that's a good thing,\\" he said. Veteran hacker Marc Rogers, who develops and proves many of the hacks featured in the show, said he had been encouraged by the care it took to get the tech right. \\"For years and years I have watched TV betray my community,\\" he said, \\"I want to see real stuff on TV that does not make me rage and which is an accurate portrayal of people in my community.\\" \\"It's been a gift to work on this,\\" he said. Andre McGregor, a consultant who formerly worked in the FBI's cyber division, said he too was heartened by the care taken over the technology in the show. \\"I find it refreshing that the accuracy is so important to them,\\" he said, adding that he was approached to help with Series Two of Mr Robot because several episodes feature law enforcement and government responses to cyber attacks. Mr McGregor said his advice extended beyond helping the show's writers understand how the FBI and law enforcement agencies investigate cyber intrusions and conduct interviews. It also involved more subtle elements such as how FBI agents arrange themselves in a room during a meeting or interrogation, he said. \\"An agent would never stand in front of a door,\\" he said. \\"It's what we call the 'fatal funnel', you could be hit by a shotgun blast through that door.\\" But there were some things that the show did gloss over, said consultant Ryan Kazanciyan, a former penetration tester who is now head of forensics at security firm Tanium. \\"It's missing the time, the number of steps you have to go through for a hack, complexity and the amount of research you have to do,\\" he said. \\"When I would do penetration testing I would have one or two weeks to get in from the outside and then one or two weeks to see how much damage I could do from the inside,\\" he said. \\"Sometimes I would go for days just coming up blank,\\" he said. \\"And then you would have that Aha! moment that gets you in.\\" He said one facet of hacking the show did get right was the view of the world that anyone with an understanding of security software swiftly acquires. \\"There's always a way in,\\" he said.","completion":"\\"Mr. Robot\\" is a popular TV show about a computer security guy named Elliot who is part of a hacker group called FSociety.

They want to teach people about the good and bad things about technology we use every day. This show is different from other TV shows that sometimes don't show computer stuff in the right way.

With its capital in Salisbury (now Harare), Rhodesia was considered a \\"de facto\\" successor state to the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia (which had achieved responsible government in 1923). - Daniel Carney ( 1944 -- 1987 ) was a Rhodesian novelist . Three of his novels have been made into films . He was a brother of Erin Pizzey , also a writer . - Erin Patria Margaret Pizzey (born 19 February 1939) is an English family care activist and a novelist. She became internationally famous for having started the first domestic violence shelter in the modern world, Chiswick Women's Aid, in 1971, the organisation known today as Refuge. Haven House is often cited as the first women's refuge (called women's shelters in Canada and the U.S.), but at the time of their founding they only worked to help the mentally ill transition from committed life in a hospital to life in the outside world. By contrast the refuge started by Erin Pizzey was focused on removing victims of domestic abuse from their abusers, in an attempt to break the cycle. - Chiswick is a district of west London, England. Most of it is in the London Borough of Hounslow. Other parts of the W4 postcode area, including Chiswick Park tube station, Acton Green, and much of Bedford Park are in the London Borough of Ealing. It contains Hogarth's House, the former residence of the 18th-century English artist William Hogarth; Chiswick House, a neo-Palladian villa regarded as one of the finest in England; and Fuller's Brewery, London's largest and oldest brewery. It occupies a meander of the River Thames used for competitive and recreational rowing, with several rowing clubs on the river bank.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which verses of the ballad about the Wabash River talk about missing a loved one? ? The ballad speaks of the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that occurred there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.Without speaking directly of death, both verses indicate the absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.The melody of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, the music begins in the key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord progression of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands. Answer:","completion":"The second verse of the ballad about the Wabash River talks about missing a loved one. This verse is about the narrator's lost love, Mary, and it indicates the absence of a loved one and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief.

Given the question: Combine facts and answer this: Camelots du Roi was a youth organization of which far-right movement and journal? The answer is:","completion":"The Camelots du Roi was a youth organization associated with the far-right movement known as Action Française, as well as its associated journal. To uncover more in-depth details, it's essential to dig into the roots of the \\"Camelots du Roi\\" and \\"Action Française.\\" The term \\"Camelots du Roi\\" was established by the French royalist movement in the early 20th century, referring to the militant action group and youth organization created by \\"Action Française,\\" a far-right political movement founded by Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois at the beginning of the 20th century, precisely in 1898, during the Dreyfus Affair. Action Française aimed to restore monarchy in France and was recognized as a significant far-right political organization in France during the early 20th century. The ideological premise of Action Française encompassed elements of nationalism, monarchism, and conservatism. It theorized that constitutional monarchy, in the form that existed before the French Revolution, was a better fit for the French than democracy. The Camelots du Roi, created in 1908, functioned as the paramilitary wing of Action Française and held a strong presence in universities in Paris and throughout France. The name \\"Camelots du Roi\\" translates as 'King's Peddlers,' because members would sell the Action Française newspaper on the streets. Through street sales and public demonstrations, they advocated for the organization's ideology, disparaging republicanism and promoting a return to monarchy. The Camelots du Roi, notorious for their confrontational nature, often became involved in street brawls with leftist groups, becoming a symbolic representation of the increasing politicization of French youth and street politics during the early 20th century. The 'Action Française' journal, meanwhile, was a daily newspaper launched by Maurice Pujo, Henri Vaugeois, and other monarchists in 1908. It was sought to disseminate their royalist ideologies and political views to a broader audience. The paper featured strong editorials, philosophical debates, and literary works, expressing their opposition to the parliamentary Republic and advocacy for traditional monarchy and Catholicism. In conclusion, the Camelots du Roi was a youth organization and militant action group of the far-right movement, Action Française, which also published the same-named journal as a mechanism to broadcast their political ideologies and philosophies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Genetics is the branch of biology that focuses on heredity in organisms. Choices: - schools - fruits - vacuums - organisms A: Answer:","completion":"Organisms Genetics is the branch of biology that deals with the study of heredity in organisms. In this context, the term \\"organisms\\" refers to any living entity that possesses the ability to reproduce, grow, and maintain homeostasis. Organisms include animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and even single-celled organisms such as amoebas. The main focus of genetics is to understand how the characteristics of organisms are passed from one generation to the next. This occurs through the transmission of genetic material in the form of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or, in some viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). This genetic material carries the hereditary information in the form of genes, which are specific sequences of DNA or RNA that code for proteins or functional RNA molecules. Genetics aims to explore several aspects of heredity, including: 1. Inheritance patterns: The way in which genes are passed down from parents to offspring. These patterns can be Mendelian (following the principles laid down by Gregor Mendel), or non-Mendelian (deviating from Mendel's principles due to various phenomena such as incomplete dominance, multiple alleles, or sex-linked inheritance). 2. Gene structure and function: The physical and chemical properties of genes, as well as the role they play in the organism's development, growth, and maintenance of homeostasis. 3. Genetic variation: The differences in genetic material found among individuals of the same species or within populations. This variation can be due to mutation, recombination, and gene flow. 4. Genotype and phenotype: The relationship between an organism's genetic makeup (genotype) and its observable characteristics (phenotype). 5. Population genetics: The study of how genetic variation, gene flow, and natural selection affect the genetic makeup of populations over time. Other areas of genetics include molecular genetics, clinical genetics, epigenetics, and genomics. Molecular genetics investigates the molecular mechanisms involved in gene regulation, replication, and expression, while clinical genetics focuses on the diagnosis, management, and prevention of genetic disorders in humans. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that are not due to changes in the DNA sequence itself. Genomics, on the other hand, involves the study of whole genomes, including gene mapping and comparative genomics, which compare the DNA sequences of different species to understand evolutionary relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the final step of the following process: - Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process where body temperature rises, the brain tells blood vessels to dilate, the sweat glands become active, moisture is released from the pores, and the moisture evaporates, can be described as the body achieving thermoregulation and maintaining a stable internal temperature. To elaborate further, this process is initiated when the body detects an increase in temperature, either through internal factors like fever or muscle activity, or external factors such as environmental heat. The rise in body temperature leads to the brain, specifically the hypothalamus, sending signals to various bodily systems to engage in cooling strategies. One such strategy is the dilation of blood vessels, particularly those near the surface of the skin. This dilation increases blood flow to the skin's surface, allowing for the transfer of excess heat to the environment. As the body's response continues, sweat glands become active and produce sweat. This sweat is a mixture of water, salts, and other compounds produced by the glands, and is released from the pores on the surface of the skin. The function of this sweating is to employ evaporative cooling, a process through which the body gets rid of excess heat. Once the moisture is released from the skin's pores and comes into contact with the air, it begins to evaporate. Evaporation is a cooling process that requires energy input in the form of heat. As the sweat evaporates, the heat contained within the body is used to fuel this conversion, effectively cooling the body down. The final step of the process is the body achieving a state of thermoregulation, whereby the body's internal temperature is stabilized, and the aforementioned cooling mechanisms (dilation of blood vessels, sweating, and evaporative cooling) manage to dissipate the excess heat. The hypothalamus then ceases its intensified signals to these systems, reducing the cooling efforts back down to baseline levels, as the desired internal temperature has been restored and further cooling is no longer necessary. In this way, the body maintains a stable and safe internal temperature, adapting to various internal and external factors to prevent overheating and other detrimental effects on bodily functions and overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As the task force was studying the issue, 900,000 was cut from state support for civil equal justice services. That prompted the state's two main legal services providers - Columbia Legal Services and Northwest Justice Project - to cut their staffs, Alexander said. The change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court to 200. The total fee would be split, with 54 percent going to counties and 46 percent going to the state for a newly created equal justice account.

Bal Harbour Shops is owned by the Whitman family and is one of the few remaining family-owned malls in the nation. Hypothesis: Bal Harbour Shops sells shavers.","completion":"In order to draw the hypothesis from the context, let's go step-by-step and analyze the information provided. Step 1: Identify the main subject The main subject in this context is Bal Harbour Shops, an upscale shopping mall. Step 2: Gather information about the subject The context states that Bal Harbour Shops is in a wealthy suburb of Miami Beach, Florida, and it is known internationally for its luxury retail. Additionally, the mall is owned by the Whitman family. Step 3: Identify any relevant information about the specific query (shavers) The context does not explicitly mention anything about shavers or the types of stores present within the mall. Step 4: Analyze if the hypothesis can be drawn from the context As the context discusses the mall's luxury retail, one could infer that it caters to high-end brands and products. However, there is no direct information about shavers, so it would be a speculation rather than a firm conclusion. Hypothesis: Based on the available information in the context, we cannot conclusively say that Bal Harbour Shops sells shavers. It might be possible, but it would require further research or more specific information about the stores and products within the mall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gamal Abdel Nasser Simultaneous with Israel's February raid, the Baghdad Pact was formed between some regional allies of the UK. Nasser considered the Baghdad Pact a threat to his efforts to eliminate British military influence in the Middle East, and a mechanism to undermine the Arab League and \\"perpetuate [Arab] subservience to Zionism and [Western] imperialism\\". Nasser felt that if he was to maintain Egypt's regional leadership position he needed to acquire modern weaponry to arm his military. When it became apparent to him that Western countries would not supply Egypt under acceptable financial and military terms, Nasser turned to the Eastern Bloc and concluded a US320,000,000 armaments agreement with Czechoslovakia on 27 September. Through the Czechoslovakian arms deal, the balance of power between Egypt and Israel was more or less equalized and Nasser's role as the Arab leader defying the West was enhanced.

Use a hacksaw to achieve an angled cut. 2. Use a miter saw to achieve an angled cut. Answer:","completion":"2. Use a miter saw to achieve an angled cut. The best way to perform an angled cut in a piece of wood is by using a miter saw. A miter saw is specifically designed for making precise angled cuts, usually for woodworking tasks like molding, picture framing, and carpentry. It has an adjustable blade which can be easily set at the desired angle, providing clean and accurate cuts. Using a hacksaw (option 1) is not the best choice for making an angled cut in wood. Hacksaws are primarily designed for cutting through metal, and while they can be used to cut wood, they do not provide the same level of precision as a miter saw. Additionally, it is more challenging to produce an accurate angled cut with a hacksaw, as it requires manually controlling the angle and maintaining stability throughout the entire cutting process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government? Makeba was among the most visible people campaigning against the apartheid system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several anti-apartheid songs, including \\"Meadowlands\\" by Strike Vilakezi and \\"Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd\\" (Watch out, Verwoerd) by Vuyisile Mini. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of \\"apartheid's cruelty\\", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that \\"there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.\\"Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: \\"Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period\\". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that \\"black is beautiful\\".

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? typical toback machinations","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence, \\"typical toback machinations,\\" we must first analyze and understand the meaning of the individual words and the overall context of the sentence. Unfortunately, the sentence seems to contain a typo or misuse of a word, which needs to be clarified to provide an accurate analysis. The word \\"typical\\" is an adjective describing something that is representative of a particular type or characteristic. It usually implies that the subject is behaving as expected and does not carry an inherently positive or negative sentiment. Now, \\"toback\\" appears to be a misspelling or an unclear reference. It might be referring to \\"tobacco,\\" the common name for a plant, or to a person named Toback. Let us consider both possibilities. 1. If referring to tobacco: In this context, \\"machinations\\" could refer to the manipulative or deceitful actions of the tobacco industry for promotion and sales of their products. \\"Machinations\\" suggests a negative sentiment because it implies hidden, dishonest tactics meant to deceive or manipulate. 2. If referring to a person named Toback: \\"Machinations\\" could refer to the underhanded or deceitful actions taken by this individual. Again, the sentiment here would be negative because \\"machinations\\" implies dishonest or manipulative behavior. In either case, the word \\"machinations\\" seems to be the primary determinant of sentiment in this sentence, and it generally conveys a negative implication. Therefore, given the limited information and assuming that the typo is resolved, the sentiment of the sentence can be considered negative.

Question: \\"What caused it to be warmer then than it is now?\\" Context: \\"During the Eocene (56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago), the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.[citation needed]\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"There were multiple factors that contributed to the warmer global temperatures during the Eocene epoch as compared to the current climate. Some of the key reasons for the warmer conditions during that time include the Earth's geography, atmospheric composition, and oceanic currents. 1. Geographical Position of Continents: During the Eocene period, the continents were not situated in the same position as they are today. Their ongoing drift significantly influenced the global climate. In particular, Australia and Antarctica were connected, allowing for the transportation of heat between the two continents. The lack of significant land masses around the poles also contributed to less ice formation, leading to an overall warmer climate. 2. Warm Equatorial Currents: As Earth's geography was different during the Eocene epoch, the warm equatorial currents mixed with the colder Antarctic waters, creating a more uniform distribution of heat around the globe. This factor contributed to higher global temperatures compared to the present climate. However, when Australia separated from Antarctica approximately 45 million years ago, these warm equatorial currents started to deflect away from Antarctica, resulting in the cooling of the Antarctic region. 3. Atmospheric Composition: During the Eocene epoch, the concentration of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), was substantially higher than it is today. This increased level of CO2 in the atmosphere led to a stronger greenhouse effect, trapping more heat and contributing to the higher global temperatures observed during that time period. 4. Oceanic Circulation: Changes in oceanic circulation also played a significant role in the global temperature variations during the Eocene epoch. As Australia separated from Antarctica, a cold water channel developed between the two continents, causing the Antarctic region to cool down. This, in turn, led to the formation of ice and the distribution of colder water and ice floes towards the north, eventually giving rise to the present pattern of ice ages around 40 million years ago. 5. Solar Radiation: Variations in solar radiation due to changes in the Earth's orbit and tilt could have also caused warmer temperatures during the Eocene period. The combination of the Earth's position relative to the Sun and the uneven distribution of solar energy contributed to the overall warmer climate conditions of this epoch. In summary, the warmer global temperatures during the Eocene epoch can be attributed to a combination of factors, including geographical positions of continents, oceanic circulation, atmospheric composition, and solar radiation. The separation of Australia and Antarctica, along with the development of a cold water channel between the two continents, contributed to the shift towards a cooler climate."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

It was announced in January 2017 that she would step down from the company's board upon the sale of Yahoo!'s operating business to Verizon Communications for 4.8 billion. She would not join the newly combined company, now called \\"Oath,\\" and announced her resignation on June 13, 2017. After graduating from Stanford, Mayer received 14 job offers, including a teaching job at Carnegie Mellon University and a consulting job at McKinsey & Company. She joined Google in 1999 as employee number 20. She started out writing code and overseeing small teams of engineers, developing and designing Google's search offerings.

Answer the following question: I heard that Jesse took a chance on Sandra and asked her to the prom only to be embarrassed when she accepted but danced with Jack all night. And I was wondering How would Jesse feel afterwards? Select from: 1). like he had been used; 2). like he made Sandra's night; 3). like he was cupid's twin; Answer:","completion":"Jesse would likely feel like he had been used after asking Sandra to the prom and experiencing the embarrassment of her dancing with Jack all night. This disappointment would stem from several factors, including unmet expectations, feelings of betrayal, and the impact on his self-esteem. 1. Unmet expectations: Jesse took a chance by asking Sandra to the prom, assuming that they would spend the evening together and enjoy each other's company. Sandra's decision to dance with Jack all night, however, completely undermined this expectation. Experiencing this disconnect between what Jesse hoped for and what actually happened may leave him feeling frustrated and taken advantage of. 2. Feelings of betrayal: Since Jesse invited Sandra to the prom as his date, it's reasonable to assume that he may have trusted her to honor the implicit social contract that comes with this invitation. By choosing to spend the evening with Jack instead, Sandra can be seen as betraying Jesse's trust. This betrayal could make Jesse feel deceived and like he had been used by Sandra. 3. Impact on self-esteem: The experience of being embarrassed at the prom due to Sandra's actions may cause Jesse's self-esteem to take a hit. He might begin to doubt his worthiness as a prom date, question his own judgment in choosing to invite Sandra, and experience feelings of insecurity as a result of the situation. These feelings can be further amplified due to the public nature of the event, as others witnessed the situation unfold and may have passed judgment on Jesse and Sandra's relationship. In summary, Jesse would most likely feel like he had been used after the prom experience because his expectations were not met, he was betrayed by Sandra, and his self-esteem was negatively impacted. This challenging situation would leave Jesse with lingering feelings of disappointment and potentially lead to reduced self-confidence and trust in others in the future."},{"prompt":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of one of Massenet's last students? ? Massenet was a prolific composer; he put this down to his way of working, rising early and composing from four o'clock in the morning until midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: \\"M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.\\"This period was an early high point in Massenet's career. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1876, and in 1878 he was appointed professor of counterpoint, fugue and composition at the Conservatoire under Thomas, who was now the director. In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer. When the result of the election was announced, Massenet sent Saint-Saëns a courteous telegram: \\"My dear colleague: the Institut has just committed a great injustice\\". Saint-Saëns cabled back, \\"I quite agree.\\" He was elected three years later, but his relations with Massenet remained cool.Massenet was a popular and respected teacher at the Conservatoire.

Write an email with the following subject: Argentina and Brazil tax assignments Email:","completion":"Subject: Argentina and Brazil Tax Assignments Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to provide you with detailed information regarding the tax assignments for our operations in Argentina and Brazil. Given the importance of ensuring that our company remains compliant with all relevant tax laws and regulations in both countries, I wanted to share our findings and insights which may help us in our future business endeavors. 1. Argentina Tax Obligations: As part of our business operations in Argentina, it is imperative that we stay updated and abide by all applicable tax laws, which primarily include: a) Corporate Income Tax (CIT): Companies established in Argentina are subject to a standard CIT rate of 25%, and all expenses related to the production of income or the maintenance of the source are deductible. b) Turnover tax: This is a provincial tax based on gross income and the rate varies depending on the province and the activity carried out. Typically, the rates range from 1% to 5%. c) Value Added Tax (VAT): Argentina's VAT is applied on domestic sales and services, as well as on imports of goods and services. The general VAT rate is 21%, with differential rates of 10.5% and 27% based on the type of product or service. d) Export Taxes: Companies that export goods or services from Argentina may be subject to export taxes, depending on the nature of the goods being exported. e) Payroll Taxes: Employers in Argentina are required to pay social security contributions based on employees' gross salaries, which generally range from 20% to 27% depending on the specific employment agreement and social charges. f) Property taxes: These are assessed annually on ownership of real property, at rates ranging from 0.5% to 2%, depending on the value and location of the property. 2. Brazil Tax Obligations: Similar to Argentina, it is crucial for our operations in Brazil to remain compliant with the country's tax laws. Some of the significant taxes our business may be liable for include: a) Corporate Income Tax (CIT): Companies in Brazil are subject to federal corporate income tax, known as the Imposto de Renda da Pessoa Jurídica (IRPJ). The standard rate is 15%, with an additional 10% surcharge applied to taxable income that exceeds BRL 240,000 (approx. USD 46,920) per year. b) Social Contribution on Net Profits (CSLL): This is an additional federal income tax applied at a rate of 9% on the company's taxable income. c) State Value Added Tax (ICMS): This is a state-level tax applied to the circulation of goods, interstate and intercity transportation, and communication services. Rates vary depending on the state and the nature of the goods or services, generally ranging from 7% to 25%. d) Service Tax (ISS): This municipal tax is levied on the provision of services and varies depending on the specific service and municipality. Rates typically range from 2% to 5%. e) Federal Value Added Tax (PIS and COFINS): These federal taxes apply to gross revenue derived from the sale of goods and services. The rates for PIS and COFINS are 1.65% and 7.6%, respectively, in the non-cumulative regime, and 0.65% and 3% in the cumulative regime. f) Payroll Taxes: Employers in Brazil must pay social security contributions, known as Contribuição Previdenciária Patronal (CPP), at a rate of around 28.8%, depending on the specific employment agreement and social charges. g) Property Taxes: These taxes apply to urban and rural properties in Brazil, at rates that vary according to the value and location of the property.

Q:Information: - The Local Group is the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way. The Local Group comprises more than 54 galaxies, most of them dwarf galaxies. Its gravitational center is located somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. The Local Group covers a diameter of (about 10 meters) and has a binary (dumbbell) distribution. The group itself is a part of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which in turn may be a part of the Laniakea Supercluster. - The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth. It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda. - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant. - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - A dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is a term in astronomy applied to low luminosity galaxies that are companions to the Milky Way and to the similar systems that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). While similar to dwarf elliptical galaxies in appearance and properties such as little to no gas or dust or recent star formation, they are approximately spheroidal in shape, generally lower luminosity, and are recognized only as satellite galaxies in the Local Group. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Andromeda V is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy about 2.52 Mly away in the constellation Andromeda . Andromeda V was discovered by Armandroff et al . and published in 1998 after their analysis of the digitized version of the second Palomar Sky Survey . The metallicity of Andromeda V is above the average metallicity to luminosity ratio of the Local Group 's dwarf galaxies . - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies. What entity does 'andromeda v' has the relation 'astronomical body' with? A:","completion":"Andromeda V has the relation 'astronomical body' with the Andromeda Galaxy (M31).

How to trap mink Learn their travel habits. Minks travel more than most furbearers, covering up to ten miles a night. They normally follow a definite route.","completion":"Step 1: Research In order to effectively trap mink, it's important to understand their behavior, habits, and habitat. The information provided indicates that minks travel more than most furbearers, so it is essential to learn their travel routes. Research online or seek advice from experienced trappers or local wildlife experts to gain more knowledge about mink behavior. Step 2: Identify a suitable trapping location Based on the information gathered, identify potential travel routes that minks might use in your area. Look for signs such as tracks, scat, or evidence of their prey. Waterways, such as streams and rivers, are common areas for mink activity. Select a location along these routes where you are likely to encounter a mink. Step 3: Choose an appropriate trap Select a trap that is specifically designed for catching mink, such as a live cage trap or a body-gripping trap. Make sure the trap is suitable for the size and strength of mink while minimizing the potential for catching non-target animals. Step 4: Determine the best trapping technique Depending on the type of trap, there may be specific techniques that are more effective for catching mink. For example, you might use bait, lures, or visual attractants to draw the mink towards the trap. Research the best practices for the trap you've chosen to increase the likelihood of success. Step 5: Set up the trap Carefully set up the trap according to the manufacturer's instructions and the technique you've selected. Ensure the trap is secure and properly camouflaged to avoid alerting the mink to its presence. Check local trapping regulations to make sure your setup complies with any rules or guidelines. Step 6: Monitor the trap Check the trap regularly, ideally at least once a day, to see if you've caught a mink. Promptly remove any animals caught, and if it's a non-target animal, release it and consider adjusting your setup to minimize the risk of future non-target captures. Step 7: Process the mink humanely If you're successful in catching a mink, handle the animal humanely, whether you plan to release it, use it for fur, or another purpose. Follow local regulations and best practices for processing the mink. Step 8: Review and refine your trapping strategy After attempting to trap mink, review your success and any challenges encountered.

Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility. I am facing a new situation today: David is a physician with the children's hospital. He is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. Patient B is female with Turner syndrome. Patient C is a male and does not have any of these illnesses.

This draws the attention of four sexually-frustrated humans in a nearby park: Oliver and Prudence (a mild-mannered professional and his highly-strung fiancée), Willy (a bumbling shop assistant) and Cliff (a middle-aged man). Oliver, Prudence, Willy and Cliff wander into the ship and encounter three aliens resembling human women: engineer Partha, nurse Cosia and the captain, known only as Skipper. Willy inadvertently drops some pornographic magazines that he has recently bought. The aliens mistake some approaching cows for a hostile force and hurriedly take off, despite warnings from the long-suffering computer about the precarious state of the ship's systems. Resuming their original course, they study their guests in detail. Fascinated by the anatomy of the males, they decide to sell them to a zoo for exotic lifeforms on a distant planet. They also debate the significance of the acts depicted in Willy's magazines. Partha is particularly keen to emulate them and enthusiastically has sex with Cliff. Skipper, Cosia and Partha subject the males to a series of tests to learn more about their abilities. Oliver and Cliff fail miserably. However, Willy, looking for his magazines, beats Skipper's combat simulation by unknowingly evading her attacks, causing her to collapse with exhaustion and infer that he is a stronger being.

During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home., can you guess it ?

Please briefly summarize this news article: Blatter Orders Brazil To Speed Up Work For 2014 GENEVA (Reuters) - FIFA president Sepp Blatter warned Brazil on Monday that they needed to speed up preparations to host the 2014 World Cup. \\"I would like to tell my Brazilian colleagues about the 2014 World Cup, it's tomorrow, the Brazilians think it's just the day after tomorrow,\\" he told reporters. \\"We are hoping for a little good faith, things are not advancing very quickly.\\" Brazil's Sports minister Orlando Silva replied by inviting Blatter to the South American country to see the work going on for himself. \\"I'm convinced he'll be reassured that Brazil will stage a very good World Cup,\\" Silva told a news conference in Sao Paulo. Blatter compared Brazil's preparations unfavorably with 2010 World Cup hosts South Africa's at the same stage four years ago. \\"If Brazil keeps going like this there will not be matches in Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo at the Confederations Cup.\\" The Confederations Cup is held the year before the World Cup in the same country and is used as dress rehearsal for the main stadiums. Blatter added that because of discussions between Brazilian politicians, it was not clear where this year's draw for the qualifying competition -- originally scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July -- would be held. Blatter also reiterated his belief that goal line technology could be used in 2014 and said he would make an important announcement about the fight against corruption at the FIFA Congress in June where he stands for re-election. Blatter faces a challenge from Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Mohamed Bin Hamman for the FIFA presidency. \\"I will present something very special there (at FIFA Congress in June) but I will not now disclose the contents -- it is to fight corruption, all cheating and discrimination,\\" he said. FIFA was rocked by a corruption scandal last year when two executive committee members were banned for offering to sell their votes in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting contest to undercover newspaper reporters. Blatter rejected suggestions that FIFA should allow external investigations into its affairs. \\"It would be like Switzerland asking France or Germany or Italy to vote for them when they elect the federal council,\\" he said. Blatter, 75 and FIFA president since 1998, also dismissed suggestions he should make way for a younger man. \\"Age is not a question of a number of years, it's a question of what you are able to do,\\" he said. \\"It is the FIFA Congress which will decide whether I am too old or not.\\" He also reflected on how FIFA had grown since he joined as a development officer 36 years ago. \\"FIFA had a World Cup with 16 teams, no development program, no youth competition, no women's competitions, nothing, just a World Cup every four years,\\" he said. \\"Even the Olympic Games was a farce because, at the time, there were only amateurs, so you can imagine why there were no western teams as champions. \\"There are 300 million active participants (in soccer) and if you count their parents and friends, that makes one billion people.\\" (Additional reporting by Tatiana Ramil in Sao Paulo) (Editing by Ed Osmond; To query or comment on this story email sportsfeedback@thomsonreuters.com)","completion":"The FIFA president Sepp Blatter told Brazil that they need to hurry up and prepare for hosting the World Cup in 2014.

I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it.

Question: \\"Who currently owns WKY's radio division?\\" Context: \\"Oklahoma City was home to several pioneers in radio and television broadcasting. Oklahoma City's WKY Radio was the first radio station transmitting west of the Mississippi River and the third radio station in the United States. WKY received its federal license in 1921 and has continually broadcast under the same call letters since 1922. In 1928, WKY was purchased by E.K. Gaylord's Oklahoma Publishing Company and affiliated with the NBC Red Network; in 1949, WKY-TV (channel 4) went on the air and later became the first independently owned television station in the U.S. to broadcast in color. In mid-2002, WKY radio was purchased outright by Citadel Broadcasting, who was bought out by Cumulus Broadcasting in 2011. The Gaylord family earlier sold WKY-TV in 1976, which has gone through a succession of owners (what is now KFOR-TV is currently owned by Tribune Broadcasting as of December 2013).\\" Answer:","completion":"The current owner of WKY's radio division is Cumulus Media Inc. This came about after a series of ownership changes throughout the years. Let's take a closer look at the transition of ownership that led to Cumulus Media owning WKY's radio division. Oklahoma City's WKY Radio has a rich history as a pioneer in radio and television broadcasting. Established in 1921, WKY holds the distinction of being the first radio station transmitting west of the Mississippi River and the third radio station in the United States. The station began broadcasting under the same call letters in 1922, and in 1928, it was acquired by E.K. Gaylord's Oklahoma Publishing Company. At that time, WKY became affiliated with the NBC Red Network. In 1949, WKY took a significant step in broadcasting history by launching WKY-TV (channel 4), which later became the first independently owned television station in the United States to broadcast in color. The radio and television divisions went their separate ways in 1976 when the Gaylord family sold WKY-TV; however, WKY Radio remained under the ownership of the Oklahoma Publishing Company. The WKY radio division saw a significant change in ownership in mid-2002 when Citadel Broadcasting purchased the station outright. Citadel Broadcasting was a significant player in the radio industry, and its acquisition of WKY added to its growing portfolio of radio stations across the country. The ownership landscape shifted again in 2011 when Cumulus Media Inc., another major broadcasting company, acquired Citadel Broadcasting in a deal worth 2.4 billion. This acquisition made Cumulus the second-largest operator of radio stations in the United States, and it brought WKY Radio under the Cumulus umbrella. As part of Cumulus Media, WKY Radio continues to be a significant presence in the Oklahoma City market. Cumulus Media owns and operates radio stations in many other markets across the country, making it a significant player in the industry. In conclusion, after a series of acquisitions and sale transactions, Cumulus Media Inc. currently owns WKY's radio division as a result of its acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting in 2011."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Question: Like with owning a kitten, what is a common danger when participating in the sport of fencing? Options: - small cuts - puncture wound - competition - injury - panting Explain why a human would choose \\"small cuts\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"small cuts\\" as an answer to the question above because they are thinking in terms of the possible physical harm that might be caused during the sport of fencing. Step 1: Analyze the question - The question asks about a common danger in fencing, which may imply some sort of harm or risk involved in participating which can be relatable to the initial comparison with owning a kitten. Step 2: Relate to the given comparison - Owning a kitten might sometimes result in small cuts or scratches due to the kitten's claws or teeth. Humans could potentially make an analogy between the sharp claws of a kitten and the sharp tip of a fencing sword, even though the comparison is not perfect. Step 3: Consider the options - Among the options provided: puncture wound, competition, injury, and panting, \\"small cuts\\" seem to be the closest to the physical harm caused by a kitten. A puncture wound is a more serious injury, competition and panting indicate more to athletic aspects rather than direct harm, and injury is a more general term that doesn't specify a type of harm. Step 4: Justify the choice - Given these considerations, a human might choose \\"small cuts\\" as the answer because it connects with the underlying theme of possible harm, and it is the closest option to the risk associated with the initial comparison to owning a kitten. However, it is important to note that fencing is a controlled sport with safety equipment, and it is designed to minimize injury, including small cuts."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What type of flight takes the most energy? Context: Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers. The answer to this question is:","completion":"powered, flapping flight"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Q: Abstract: To acquire information about the characteristics of U.S. citizens who had recently studied medicine abroad, the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) and the Association of American Medical Colleges merged independently collected data on a study group of 10,460 U.S. citizens who attended 359 medical schools in 75 foreign countries and who took their first ECFMG examination between 1978 and 1982. The study group was markedly heterogeneous: 21 percent were not U.S. citizens at birth, 32 percent did not have English as a native language, and 12 percent had two or more years of undergraduate college education in Puerto Rico. Sixty-seven percent resided in New York, New Jersey, California, Florida, or Puerto Rico, and 74 percent studied medicine in Mexico or the Caribbean. Forty-six percent passed the ECFMG examination on their first attempt, and 22 percent passed a subsequent examination. Only 45 percent had applied to a U.S. medical school, and 65 percent had taken the Medical College Admission Test. The means of the college grade-point averages, known for 39 percent of the study group, and of the scores on the admission test, known for 65 percent, were lower than those of both accepted and unaccepted applicants to U.S. medical schools in the 1976 and 1978 entering classes. The finding that 55 percent of the study group did not apply to a U.S. medical school does not support the widely held belief that most, if not all, U.S. citizens who attend foreign medical schools do so only after several unsuccessful attempts to gain admission to a U.S. school.

Like the planets, they go around the sun. But comets are not made of solid rocks like planets. A comet is a ball of dust, stones, and ice. Many people call comets dirty snowballs. The \\"snowball\\" may be only a few miles across. But when the sun heats the \\"snowball,\\" much of it is changed to gases. The gases spread out and form the comet's head, which may be thousands of miles across. A comet moves fast in its trip around the sun. But when we see it, the comet does not seem to move. That's because it is so far away. The moon moves fast, but when you look at it, you can't see any motion . That's because the moon is far away. Each year astronomers discover new comets. Some of them are seen only once. They make one trip around the sun and then go away out into space. The sun's gravity cannot hold them. Other comets, like Halley, keep returning. They have been captured by the sun. Halley's earliest visit was probably 3,000 years ago. It may keep returning for another 3,000 years. But every time a comet goes around the sun, the comet loses part of itself. Gases and dust are pulled out of the comet. That's why Halley is now dimmer than it used to be. Next time it visits us, in 2062, it may be even dimmer. Each visit it may get dimmer and dimmer, until it finally disappears. What is this passage mostly about? A) Comets and the sun.

This possible weakness in the Democratic coalition coincides with a bit more slippage among Obama's 2008 supporters (9%) than among McCain voters who won't vote GOP in November (5%). Bottom line: By picking the bona fide conservative Ryan, the Republican base is likely to deliver a rapturous response, which may allow Romney to succeed in exploiting Obama's greatest weakness at this point. Before you conclude this is far-fetched, think back to Karl Rove's strategy in 2004 to move right with strident social conservatism on abortion and same-sex marriage, steep tax cuts and hawkish policies in Afghanistan and Iraq. Embracing the base and scorning the rush to the middle cost George W. Bush the independent vote. But Bush also supercharged conservatives and Republicans, who turned out in droves. Refuting the conventional wisdom that Democrats do best in high-turnout elections, it was Bush who most benefited from the 16% jump in the total vote. But -- there's always a but. Even as Ryan fires up conservatives, he may also mobilize votes for Obama -- including senior citizens who reside in key swing states like Florida. Alarmed by his draconian proposals to remake Medicare, they may boost their support of Obama. Another potential risk: A good number of voters may be primed to punish the incumbent for poor economic times. Pluralities of Ohio and Florida independents report that Obama's re-election would hurt their personal financial situation. But the coming hullabaloo over Ryan's budget proposals may distract the economically pained from punishing Obama. All in all, Romney has a tough battle ahead -- even stringent counts of Electoral College votes based on polls show Obama within striking distance of winning. But using Ryan to ignite the Republican base is probably Romney's most plausible path to prevailing. And, it may produce a campaign focused a bit more on policy than on birth certificates, service records and the other side issues of recent elections.

This way, we keep the equality balanced.

Johnny and his friend Cully, a musician and composer, visit a gypsy camp to get his fortune told. A lady reads tea leaves and tells Johnny that he will soon meet a red-haired woman who will bring him luck.

Answer the following question: Information: - An accident, also known as an unintentional injury, is an undesirable, incidental and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term \\"accident\\" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity (Robertson, 2015). - Death is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism. Phenomena which commonly bring about death include biological aging, predation, malnutrition, disease, suicide, homicide, starvation, dehydration, and accidents or trauma resulting in terminal injury. Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death. - Nazareth (\\"Narat\\" \\"Narath\\" \\"an-Nira\\") is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as \\"the Arab capital of Israel\\". In its population was . The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. Nazareth Illit (lit. \\"Upper Nazareth\\") is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974. - Lazarus of Bethany , also known as Saint Lazarus or Lazarus of the Four Days , is the subject of a prominent miracle attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of John , in which Jesus restores him to life four days after his death . The Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions offer varying accounts of the later events of his life . In the context of the seven signs in the Gospel of John , the Raising of Lazarus is the climactic narrative : exemplifying the power of Jesus \`\` over the last and most irresistible enemy of humanity -- death . For this reason it is given a prominent place in the gospel . '' A figure named \`\` Lazarus '' ( Latinised from the Aramaic : , Elzr , cf. Heb. Eleazar -- \`\` God is my help '' ) is also mentioned in the Gospel of Luke . The two Biblical characters named \`\` Lazarus '' have sometimes been conflated historically , but are generally understood to be two separate people . The name \`\` Lazarus '' is frequently used in science and popular culture in reference to apparent restoration to life ; for example , the scientific term \`\` Lazarus taxon '' denotes organisms that reappear in the fossil record after a period of apparent extinction . There are also numerous literary uses of the term . - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: \\"Pontius Pltus\\", , \\"Pontios Pltos\\") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books. - Malnutrition or malnourishment is a condition that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems. It may involve calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals. Not enough nutrients is called undernutrition or undernourishment while too much is called overnutrition. Malnutrition is often used specifically to refer to undernutrition where there is not enough calories, protein, or micronutrients. If undernutrition occurs during pregnancy, or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development. Extreme undernourishment, known as starvation, may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and abdomen. People also often get infections and are frequently cold. The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking. Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high-quality food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies. Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common. In some developing countries, overnutrition in the form of obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition. Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery. Efforts to improve nutrition are some of the most effective forms of development aid. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and... - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of...

Here are possible answers to this question: - trust - move mountains - uplift - belief - experience I believe the correct choice is \\"belief\\", here's why:","completion":"\\"Belief\\" is indeed the most appropriate synonym for faith among the options provided. While faith and belief can sometimes be used interchangeably, it is essential to understand the nuances that distinguish them. Let's explore the reasons in greater detail. Faith is a complete trust or confidence in someone or something, often associated with spiritual or religious matters. Faith can be seen as a steadfast assurance in a higher power, doctrine, or set of principles, even in the absence of empirical evidence. However, faith can also be secular, referring to trust in other individuals, processes, or ideas without needing conclusive proof. Belief, on the other hand, refers to accepting something as true or regarding it as the correct view. Similar to faith, belief is often used in spiritual or religious contexts to describe one's conviction in divine powers or teachings. Both faith and belief embody a sense of commitment and trust in something. Now let's discuss the other options: - Trust: Although trust is a crucial component of faith, it does not wholly define it. Faith often encompasses spiritual or religious convictions, while trust typically corresponds to confidence in a person or thing due to past experiences or knowledge. - Move mountains: This phrase denotes achieving seemingly impossible or challenging feats, often with the power of faith or determination. As an idiomatic expression, it does not serve as an accurate synonym for faith. - Uplift: Uplifting usually implies elevating or inspiring someone emotionally or spiritually. While faith can often uplift an individual, \\"uplift\\" does not possess the same connotations as faith and is not a suitable synonym. - Experience: Experience denotes an event, encounter, or occurrence that affects a person and leads to increased understanding or knowledge. Experience does not capture the essence of faith as a trust or confidence in a particular belief or principle. In conclusion, \\"belief\\" is the most fitting synonym for faith among the listed options, as both terms represent a conviction or trust in someone or something. Although there are subtle differences between the two, they share a common thread of commitment and confidence, making \\"belief\\" the best choice as a synonym for faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which new planet has a cooler atmosphere? The answer is:","completion":"Bothar has a cooler atmosphere. The reason for this is that Norlon is inhabited by a species that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which contributes to the greenhouse effect. This effect warms the planet by trapping heat in the atmosphere. In contrast, Bothar does not have such a species; therefore, its atmosphere has less carbon dioxide and is less affected by the greenhouse effect, resulting in a cooler atmosphere compared to Norlon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When I was in middle school, if you didn’t have homework completed or goofed off in some way, teachers could make you stay after school for ‘after school help.’ It was essentially a mandatory study hall and if a teacher called you out, you had no choice in the matter. Now, I was in Biology class towards end of my middle school career and was sitting at one of those lab tables next to another student. We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people’s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn’t quite finish. Our teacher is working his way around the classroom checking assignments. So, he checks my lab partner, “well Scott, looks like you will be staying after school today.” This fellow student knew I didn’t have mine either, but also knew I was a pretty good student. I feel like I am sweating bullets and trembling as the teacher approaches me. In a near panic, I reach into my folder and pull out a prior week’s assignment. He looks it over and says “OK, good job” or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief. Even funnier was the fact that this week’s assignment required 6–7 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page. It was totally obvious what I had done, but our teacher gave me a break that day. I managed to make it thru all three years without needing any ‘after school help!’ This was a large public school and they still paddled students if the infraction was serious enough.

Pope Innocent IV began urging the Hungarians to undertake another crusade in late 1246 and 1247, and they appeared willing. Matthew Ninoslav argued that he only associated with heretics to defend Bosnia against Hungarian invaders. He appears to have convinced Innocent, who suspended the crusade in March 1248. A crusade against Bosnia was preached again in 1337-38 and 1367, by popes Benedict XII and Urban V respectively, but in drastically different political circumstances. Hungary was ruled by a new dynasty, the Capetian Angevins, who supported the Kotromanić rulers of Bosnia. King Charles Robert once declared that any Hungarian who attacked Bosnia, ruled by his friend Stephen II, would be regarded as a traitor. The only significant impact the Bosnian Crusade had was augmenting the anti-Hungarian sentiment among the Bosnians, a major factor in Bosnian politics that contributed to the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia in 1463 and lasted beyond it.

The sum of the two numbers is 77, so: x + y = 77 2. 5 times one number is equal to 6 times the other, so: 5x = 6y Now we need to solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y. First, we'll solve the first equation for one of the variables, let's say x: x = 77 - y Next, we'll substitute this expression for x into the second equation: 5(77 - y) = 6y Now, we will distribute and simplify the equation: 385 - 5y = 6y Combine like terms: 385 = 11y Now, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 11 to solve for y: y = 35 We found that the second number y is 35.

Translate to English","completion":"The Celts also gave the land its name, which was derived from Galaicos and later became Galicia. The Celts, a cultural and linguistic group originating in central Europe, played a significant role in shaping the early history of many regions across the continent. One such region is Galicia, located in the northwest of modern-day Spain. The Celts arrived in this region during the Iron Age, around the 9th or 8th century BC. They brought with them a distinct culture, language, and traditions that helped shape the identity of this area. The name 'Galicia' has its origin in the Celtic tribes inhabiting the region, specifically the tribe known as \\"Galaicos\\" or \\"Gallaeci.\\" These tribes had a strong presence on the Iberian Peninsula and were known for their fierce warriors and distinct customs. The word \\"Galaicos\\" is believed to have a possible connection to the Celtic word \\"Gall,\\" which stands for “stranger” or “foreigner.” The Romans later adopted this term when referring to the region and its Celtic inhabitants. As time went on and cultures continued to merge and evolve, the term 'Galaicos' underwent transformations. With the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the Latin language began to influence the local languages and dialects. As a result, the name \\"Galaicos\\" gradually evolved into \\"Gallici,\\" which more closely resembled the Latin linguistic structure. Eventually, the term \\"Gallici\\" underwent further linguistic changes and adaptations, ultimately resulting in the name \\"Galicia.\\" This name has remained in use to this day, representing the region's unique identity and the lasting influence of its Celtic past. Today, Galicia is an autonomous community within Spain, known for its lush landscapes, rugged coastline, and unique cultural heritage. While the Celtic influence may not be as evident as it once was, the region's history and its name serve as a testament to the enduring legacy of the Celts and their impact on the lands they inhabited."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Battle for Terra Movie plot: Mala (Evan Rachel Wood) and her friend Senn (Justin Long) are young alien creatures who live on Terra, a planet from a star system in the Milky Way. Terra is a peaceful planet of alien creatures who have a rich semi-advanced culture. One day a large, mysterious object blocks the Terrian sun, piquing the Terrians' interest. However, since the Terrian culture bans the development of new technologies, such as telescopes, without the approval of the ruling council, none of the inhabitants are able to get a closer look at the huge object in their sky. Mala, who is inventive and headstrong, goes against the rules of her community and creates a telescope, which she takes out into the dark empty area outside the Terrian city and uses to view the object and witnesses smaller objects coming from the large object that turn out to be incoming scout spaceships. She returns to the city to find that the scout spaceships have already started abducting Terrians (who willingly offer themselves to the scout spaceships mistaking them as their new \\"gods\\"). After Mala's own father, Roven (Dennis Quaid) is abducted she goads a ship into tailing her and lures it into a trap, which causes it to crash. Afterward, she saves the life of the pilot, revealed to be a human, an officer named Lieutenant Jim Stanton (Luke Wilson). After his personal robot assistant named Giddy (David Cross) warns Mala that Stanton will die without a supply of oxygen (which the Terrian atmosphere does not contain), she creates an oxygen generator and fills a tent with air containing oxygen so that Jim can breathe, and eventually convinces Giddy to teach her human language. The Robot informs Mala that the mysterious object is a generation ship called The Ark, containing humans from Earth. Centuries beforehand, both Mars and Venus were terraformed by humans and colonized.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded as having arrived in 166 AD by the Book of the Later Han. The embassy came to Emperor Huan of Han China from \\"Andun\\" (Chinese: 安敦; Emperor Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus), \\"king of Daqin\\" (Rome). As Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and the envoy arrived in 166 AD, confusion remains about who sent the mission, as both emperors were named \\"Antoninus\\". The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier of Rinan or Tonkin (present-day Vietnam). It brought presents of rhinoceros horns, ivory, and tortoise shell, probably acquired in Southern Asia. The text states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries. Yule speculated that the Roman visitors must have lost their original wares due to robbery or shipwreck and used the gifts instead, prompting Chinese sources to suspect them of withholding their more precious valuables, which Yule notes was the same criticism directed at papal missionary John of Montecorvino when he arrived in China in the late 13th century AD. Historians Rafe de Crespigny, Peter Fibiger Bang, and Warwick Ball believe that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants rather than official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius. Crespigny stresses that the presence of this Roman embassy as well as others from Tianzhu (in northern India) and Buyeo (in Manchuria) provided much-needed prestige for Emperor Huan, as he was facing serious political troubles and fallout for the forced suicide of politician Liang Ji, who had dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na. Yule emphasised that the Roman embassy was said to come by way of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam, the same route that Chinese sources claimed the embassies from Tianzhu (northern India) had used in 159 and 161 AD.

Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

Input: At Lanark Sheriff Court, he was convicted of seven charges of indecent assault in the 1970s and early 1980s. Talbot was a teacher at a school in the Manchester area at the time and took boys away on camping and boating trips. Sheriff Nikola Stewart asked for background reports and will sentence him next month. Talbot, 67, of Greater Manchester, had denied the allegations but was convicted of seven of the nine charges he faced after a nine-day trial. He was cleared of two charges - one of indecent assault and one of lewd, indecent and libidinous practices - on not proven verdicts. The offences, against boys aged 15 to 17, all took place between 1978 and 1981. They happened during separate trips to two locations - one near Moffat in southern Scotland, and one on the Caledonian Canal in Inverness. During the trial, a succession of witnesses, now men in their 50s who cannot be named for legal reasons, told of their initial excitement at going on the trips - sometimes the first time away from their parents. At the time, Talbot was a young teacher \\"with a more relaxed attitude than others\\" and would talk to the boys about topics such as pop music, alcohol and sex, the court heard. The men went on to recount how Talbot abused his position of trust to attack them more than 35 years ago. One man told the court he was indecently assaulted as a teenage boy after a visit to a pub on a camping trip left him \\"very much the worse for wear\\". The witness told of his \\"horror\\" when he awoke - after being \\"singled out\\" to go to the pub - to find Talbot touching him in a tent when he was partially clothed. Another witness gave evidence over a video link from Australia to recount how he woke in his tent to find Talbot making a sexual advance on him. A further witness said he was left \\"petrified\\" when Talbot indecently assaulted him on a trip to the Caledonian Canal in 1979. Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown, 54, who was not an alleged victim, also gave evidence at the trial and said he had never forgotten the moment Talbot invited one of his young friends to sleep in his tent on a school camping trip. Det Insp Bryan Lee welcomed the guilty verdicts, describing Talbot as a \\"sexual predator who hid behind a mask of respectability\\". \\"He used his position as a teacher to engineer situations which allowed him to isolate and target his victims,\\" he said. \\"He took advantage of his position of trust to abuse young men in his care. \\"Thanks to the bravery of his victims, their courage in speaking to us and their commitment and support throughout this investigation, and to close working with Greater Manchester Police, we have been able to secure this conviction today.\\" He added the police message was that they would listen and take action on all reports of abuse no matter where or when they occurred. Talbot was jailed for five years at Manchester Crown Court in 2015 for the indecent assault of two 14-year-old boys. The former television personality was formerly a regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's This Morning show.

(CNN) -- The brand name Yukos no longer exists and its former founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky has left Russia after being freed from jail, but a landmark ruling in the Hague released Monday ensures their legacy will live on during a sensitive period of time for Vladimir Putin. Yukos was one of Russia's oil giants through the 1990s and until the early 2000s, when its assets were expropriated by the state after a political battle with Khodorkovsky. Now the Permanent Court of Arbitration, in what is considered a landmark judgment, has ordered payment of damages to its former shareholders, totaling 50 billion and including interest and fees for violation of a treaty covering Russia's energy assets. \\"The","completion":"ruling sends a clear message to Russia and other countries that unjust expropriation of assets and politically motivated actions against businesses will not go unpunished,\\" the Permanent Court of Arbitration stated. This decision comes at a time when Vladimir Putin's government is already under scrutiny due to rising tensions with the West, particularly over Ukraine and the ongoing investigation into alleged election interference. Observers believe that the timing of the judgment could prove to be a double-edged sword for the Kremlin. On one hand, it may further damage Russia's international reputation and increase pressure for reforms and transparency within the country. On the other hand, it could rally domestic support as the government portrays itself as a victim of foreign interference and political bias. The court's decision has been hailed as a victory for the rule of law by the ex-shareholders of Yukos and their legal representatives. GML, the group representing former shareholders, stated that this judgment \\"confirms the politically motivated attacks on Yukos and vindicates the rights of the company's former shareholders.\\" Meanwhile, Khodorkovsky, who now runs the Open Russia Foundation from his exile in Switzerland, called the ruling \\"encouraging\\" and hopes it will serve as a precedent for other victims of political repression. However, the question of whether Russia will comply with the court's ruling remains uncertain. The Russian government has long argued that the case is politically motivated and the court lacks jurisdiction over the matter. Despite the uncertainty, the ruling is seen as a major milestone in a long-standing legal battle, and it will likely have lasting implications on Russia's actions both domestically and on the international stage. The Yukos case has been a thorn in the side of Putin's administration since its inception, and this ruling is a stark reminder that political battles of the past still have a significant impact on the present. As the world watches to see how Russia will respond, the legacy of Yukos and its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, continues to shape the political landscape, pushing the limits of power and justice in an increasingly complex world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Control for the following movie plot: In October 1973, \\"Control\\", head of British intelligence (\\"the Circus\\"), sends agent Jim Prideaux to Budapest to meet a Hungarian general wishing to defect. Prideaux is shot and captured. Amid the international incident that follows, Control and his right-hand man George Smiley are forced into retirement. Control dies of illness. Percy Alleline becomes the new Chief, with Bill Haydon as his deputy, and Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase as key lieutenants. Despite Control and Smiley's misgivings, their successors had already begun a secret operationâ\\"Witchcraft\\"âto obtain Soviet intelligence, which is being exchanged with the CIA for US intelligence. Smiley is brought out of retirement by Oliver Lacon, the civil servant in charge of intelligence, to investigate a claim by Ricki Tarr, a British spy, that there has been a long-term mole in a senior role in the Circus, as Control had suspected. Smiley chooses a trustworthy agent, Peter Guillam, and retired Special Branch officer Mendel to help him. He interviews Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after deducing that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet cultural attachÃ© in London, was a spy. Tarr tells Smiley that, on a mission to Istanbul, he had had an affair with Irina, a Soviet agent. She wanted to reveal the name of a mole in the top ranks of the Circus, but when Tarr reported this to London, they ignored him and ordered him straight home, whereas Moscow immediately kidnapped Irina. Tarr concluded that the mole had intercepted his message, and went into hiding, suspected of defecting and murdering the British station chief. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr called: he finds the pages for that night are cut out, suggesting that Tarr's story is true. Smiley interviews Prideaux, who after brutal interrogation was exchanged by the Soviets but sacked from the service. Prideaux says the purpose of the mission to Hungary was to get the name of the mole. Control had codenamed the suspects \\"Tinker\\" (Alleline), \\"Tailor\\" (Haydon), \\"Soldier\\"...

You can offer some related item or incentive to increase the odds that people will purchase the eBook. This is a particularly good strategy if you have other eBooks that you've written. You can offer access to one of these books for free with the purchase of your new book. Keep in mind that you should never offer something for free that will cost you a lot of money. If the cost of the free gift is more than the profit you'll make on the eBook, you will put yourself in the hole financially! An affiliate program is a system to gain referrals in exchange for a commission. Members of your affiliate program will receive a small incentive to promote your book for you.. For instance, a popular lifestyle blogger might recommend your eBook and provide a referral link to her readers, and she will earn a 10% commission on sales that result from site traffic and purchases using that referral link. You need to ensure that the price of your eBook can justify paying commissions. A book that sells for 0.99, for example, can only afford a few penny's worth of commission for referrals. You can ask friends, family, or members of your writing club to serve as affiliates, but the most affective online affiliates are those with a substantial blog or social media presence. Search engine optimization (SEO) is a way to ensure that when people search the internet using popular search engines, your eBook will show up in the suggested results. For instance, if you've written an eBook about changing tires, your eBook website would show up in the first page of search results when a person typed in the search query \\"how to change a tire.\\" To take advantage of search engine optimization, you need to make sure your eBook or author website uses the right terms and phrases, known as keywords, to drive traffic to your site. Start by creating a very extensive list of all the possible search engine queries a person may use who would benefit from your eBook. In the example of an eBook on changing tires, you might include makes and models of cars included in your guide; popular brands of tires; words like tire, car, maintenance, mechanic, service; and others. Next, update your website using these words as much as possible, in the actual text visible to readers (the \\"front page\\") and the indexing system you use on the \\"back page\\" as you write the website.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

Gregory smiles and looks carefully. It could be a year before Gregory, 4 months old, can speak, but now his mother hopes to communicate with her baby through sign language. Like others around the world, Campbell is part of a growing movement of parents teaching hearing babies simple signs to communicate before they can talk. The baby sign language has been more popular in recent years. The movie,\\"Meet the Fockers\\",where the main character teaches his young grandson to sign, makes it well developed. Babies generally begin to talk between 12 and 15 months, but babies can use sign language to communicate before they learn how to speak. \\"We know they are learning language faster than they are able to show you with their speech production because that system takes a long time to develop.\\" says McRoberts, director of developmental research at the Haskins Laboratories. \\"They are understanding words before they are able to say them.

Others may pause to wonder why Connecticut--and 19 other states--needs an antitrust policy separate from that of the United States. Does it follow that \\"Many wonder why 20 states need a different antitrust policy than the one written by the United States.\\"? Choose your answer from: [-] yes. [-] it is not possible to tell. [-] no.","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Many wonder why 20 states need a different antitrust policy than the one written by the United States.\\" accurately reflects the sentiment of those who question the necessity of state-level antitrust policies. Antitrust laws play a crucial role in regulating the competitiveness within an economy, preventing monopolies and promoting fair competition. In the United States, federal antitrust laws such as the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act provide a unified framework to prevent businesses from engaging in anti-competitive practices. However, some states such as Connecticut have enacted their own antitrust laws and established specific antitrust policies. There are reasons for this divergence and it can be helpful to understand the underlying motivations behind the existence of state-level antitrust policies. 1. Tailored regulation: State antitrust policies can be designed to address specific regional issues related to competition and market dynamics. State policymakers can create legislation that targets economic matters unique to their jurisdiction, allowing for a more tailored approach than a strictly federal system might offer. 2. Enforcement: States may enact their own antitrust policy to ensure that they have the authority to enforce the laws at the state level. In some cases, state attorneys general might have more experience dealing with local issues, giving them an advantage in enforcement efforts. 3. Policy experimentation: States often function as laboratories of policy experimentation. State-level antitrust laws can serve as an opportunity for states to test new legislation and policies that might better address contemporary business practices and market dynamics. If successful, these innovative policies could serve as models for future federal legislation. 4. Additional protection: State antitrust policies can provide consumers and businesses with additional protection and recompense in cases where federal laws fail to offer adequate reassurance. While there are valid arguments for having state-level antitrust policies, those who question the need for different antitrust policies in 20 states might have concerns about potential drawbacks, such as: 1. Fragmentation: With 20 states having their own antitrust policies, this creates a more fragmented and complex landscape for businesses to navigate. Companies operating in multiple states must ensure compliance with both federal and varying state regulations, potentially increasing the costs and challenges of operating in these areas. 2. Inconsistencies: Divergent antitrust laws and policies across states could create inconsistencies and disparities in business regulation. This might be confusing and potentially lead to unfair advantages or disadvantages for companies operating in different states. 3. Overlapping authority: There is the potential for overlapping authority between the federal and state agencies, which might complicate enforcement and lead to wasteful duplication of effort. In conclusion, the statement \\"Many wonder why 20 states need a different antitrust policy than the one written by the United States.\\" reflects the perspective of those who question the necessity of state-level antitrust policies. It is important to weigh the benefits of tailored regulation and enforcement against potential drawbacks such as fragmentation, inconsistencies, and overlapping authority when examining the rationale for state antitrust policies."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"Danny Patrick (politician)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

UPDATED:. 12:27 EST, 28 September 2013. Glamour: Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva pictured at the Cannes Film Festival. Both sisters would look at home in a. James Bond film - both are wealthy, glamorous, and the daughter of a. central Asian dictator. But. Lola, the 35-year-old younger daughter of Islam Karimov, has revealed. in her first in her first interview with Western media that she and her. elder sister Gulnara hate each other. Lola. Karimova-Tillyaeva, Uzbekistan's permanent representative at Unesco in. Paris, agreed to take part in an interview with the BBC Uzbek Service. carried out by email. Lola has tended to avoid the media since she attempted to sue a French website that called her a 'dictator's daughter' in 2011. Human rights activists testified at the trial and the case was thrown out. Lola is based in Geneva, is Uzbekistan's ambassador to Unesco in Paris, and lives in a mansion that reportedly cost £29m. She said that she had not spoken to her ambitious older sister, Gulnara, for 12 years. She went further, saying she ensured her two or three visits to Uzbekistan per year do not coincide with the times Gulnara will be there. 'We have never hidden this from anyone ... We have neither family nor friendship contacts,' she said. 'We don't even meet each other for family activities.' Gulnara, 41, who is seen as a possible presidential successor, is known as a pop singer and fashion designer and runs jewellery and cosmetics businesses and number of charities. Last year as her alter-ego GooGoosha, she recorded a duet with Gerard Depardieu, Until recently she was Uzbekistan's permanent representative in the UN in Geneva and the country's ambassador in Spain. However, there are plenty of similarities between the two: both lead jet-set lifestyles, hob-nob with Western celebrities and pride themselves on their generous philanthropic endeavours. Lola and her husband Timur have been included in a list of Swizterland's wealthiest people - and so has Gulnara. But it seems that rivalry and resentment trump sisterly loyalty. 'Any good relationship requires a similarity of outlook or likeness of character,' said Lola. Harmony? Lola's sister Gulnara pictured here with Sting, who defended his decision to perform in Uzbekistan despite its poor human rights record. 'There is nothing like that in our relationship, has never been and is not now.' She said she and her sister had had quite different characters since childhood.'And these differences, as you know, only grow over the years.' This is not merely a family squabble. Their father is 75 and rumours have begun to swirl around the question of his succeessor. Karimov has ruled the country since it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 with such an iron grip that there are no major high-profile politicians waiting in the wings. Party: Lola and her husband Timur pictured in Saint Tropez. Gulnara has long been tipped as a possible successor, but she is deeply unpopular in Uzbekistan. A US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks referred to her as 'the single most hated person in the country'. The Harvard graduate has been given diplomatic status by her father, and according to the memos sent to Washington, seen as a 'robber baron'. Lola was no politician and wanted to focus on her family. But she told the BBC she thought Gulnara's chances of succeeding their father are 'slim'. It may be that Lola is publicly distancing herself from her sister because Gulnara has been linked to a wide-ranging international fraud investigations. Critics claim she runs a huge business empire in Uzbekistan. Gulnara has denied all wrongdoing. Lola told the BBC that she does not know whether her father is aware of the allegations surrounding her sister's business interests, ebcause she and her father never discuss politics. Asked why she sued the French news site, Rue89, Lola said that it hurts her when the media referred to her only as a 'dictator's daughter'.'I want to be seen as a person with her own principles and viewpoint,' she said. On the question of her father's policies, she said she agreed with his view that radicalisation of the population was largely due to unemployment and lack of opportunity. Karimov has been accused of using the pretext of combating Islamic extremism to quash all dissent. She said: 'And I am confident they cannot be solved by using force.' Karimov is accused of sanctioning his henchmen to slaughter hundreds of his own citizens at a massacre in the city of Andijan in 2005, though western leaders have courted him due to his country's proximity to Afghanistan. Human rights activists say he has had opponents boiled alive, and torture is widespread in the country's prisons. Uprising: the Andijan massacre in 2005 was one of the bloodiest episodes in Uzbekistan's post-Soviet history. Karimov said in a television interview in June that Uzbeks who went to Russia to look for work were 'lazy', and said he felt 'disgusted that people go there for a slice of bread'. Average annual income in Uzbekistan is just £1,063, and the US estimates that around one in four Uzbeks works abroad because of a lack of work closer to home. Her father has been accused of forcing Uzbeks, even minors, to spend their summers picking cotton for little or no pay. In her email interview she appeared to criticise this practice. 'I am against any exploitation, especially the exploitation of children,' she said. Ally: after 9/11 US President George W Bush met President Karimov, viewing Uzbekistan as useful because it borders Afghanistan. Curiously, despite Lola's claim that she and her sister have not spoken for 12 years, another leaked US cable suggests that only nine years ago the two partied together in the capital, Tashkent, where Lola reportedly owned a nightclub. '[Lola] Karimova typically arrives in her – one-of-a-kind, for Tashkent – Porsche Cayenne S sports utility vehicle around 10 o'clock for the traditional floorshow and stays until the wee hours dancing the night away in the raucous disco. 'On occasion, her older sister, Gulnora, joins her around three o'clock in the morning,' the cable says. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

Here are possible answers to this question: - occasionally - seldom - hardly ever - infrequently - never I believe the correct choice is \\"occasionally\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is \\"occasionally\\" based on the description provided about Billy's eating habits. Here's why: In the given scenario, we can deduce the following points: 1. Billy often eats hamburgers but doesn't always include cheese. 2. He eats cheeseburgers more often than some people, indicating that he does consume cheeseburgers but not necessarily at a higher frequency than all others. 3. He eats cheeseburgers less often than others, implying that his consumption is not extremely frequent, but he still indulges in them. Based on these points, \\"occasionally\\" best describes Billy's cheeseburger consumption behavior. Let's compare this with the other options: - Seldom: This term implies that something rarely occurs. Considering that Billy eats cheeseburgers more often than some people, \\"seldom\\" might underestimate his frequency of consumption. - Hardly ever: This choice indicates that something almost never happens, which does not fit the description of Billy's eating habits since he does eat cheeseburgers more often than some people. - Infrequently: While this term might seem similar to \\"occasionally,\\" it tends to refer to something happening less often than the latter. Therefore, it might not fully capture the extent of Billy's cheeseburger consumption. - Never: This option is not accurate since the scenario explicitly mentions that Billy does eat cheeseburgers, just not as often as other people. In conclusion, the term \\"occasionally\\" best captures the idea that Billy consumes cheeseburgers with a certain frequency, more often than some but less often than others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Mother and Son Context: The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail old woman. They recline in a silence broken only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey from her sickbed to her deathbed. It is a circular motion which travels a long walk through a dreamlike landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous sky of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the world. They return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed that now seems to resemble a coffin. Although he tries to reassure her to the contrary they both know that the end is coming. He leaves her and goes for a long solitary walk. When he returns he weeps for his mother who's died. Answer:","completion":"The old woman is the sick mother (Gudrun Geyer) in the movie Mother and Son.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Tampa Bay Lightning at Toronto Maple Leafs game preview Expectations in hockey-mad Toronto appear to be taking their toll on the Maple Leafs, whose coach is aware of both the issue of his job security and the tension surrounding his struggling team. Randy Carlyle's club has lost three straight heading into Thursday night's home matchup with the Tampa Bay Lightning, and he's aware that improvement needs to come quickly. A 9-2 home loss to Nashville on Tuesday had Carlyle on the defensive the next day, as he often appeared agitated during his post-practice news conference. \\"You're always in a position of doubt when things go awry with your hockey club. When you take these jobs, you can expect that,\\" he said. \\"In this market it's a little bit more intense at times, just by the number of (media) that are here today. We have some faces that we haven't (seen) all year, and it's very similar to last night, that it seems that negativity brings a lot more people out to ask the questions, and rightfully so.\\" Toronto (9-8-2) hadn't allowed nine goals since a 12-1 loss to Pittsburgh on Dec. 26, 1991. It's been outscored 17-5 during its losing streak, including a 6-2 loss to lowly Buffalo on Saturday. Carlyle also spoke about his beleaguered players \\"squeezing the stick\\" in practice Wednesday. \\"Honestly, we've got to quiet the noise,\\" defenseman Cody Franson said. \\"We are feeling a lot of pressure right now and it's tough not to feel that and just focus on hockey. I think we're in a situation where everyone is feeling the heat.\\" The Leafs went 6-1-1 in their eight games before their skid, during which they've lost twice at home following a four-game winning streak at Air Canada Centre. \\"When you get beat like that in professional sports it is embarrassing, and when you get beat like that in front of your home fans it compounds things,\\" captain Dion Phaneuf said. \\"It is unacceptable.\\" They'll look to bounce back against a Lightning team coming off a 5-2 loss to the New York Islanders on Tuesday. Tampa Bay (13-5-2) had won its previous two but looked sluggish late in second of a back-to-back set. Alex Killorn and Ondrej Palat scored for the Lightning, which lost center Cedric Paquette in the first period to a lower-body injury. The status of Paquette, who had five goals in his previous six games, is unclear. \\"That's a tough one for us,\\" coach Jon Cooper said. \\"We gave them six power plays. We lost a forward, so we're playing 50 minutes in a back-to-back with 11 forwards.\\" The Lightning could get a boost from the return of winger Brett Connolly, who has missed the last 12 with a leg injury. He said he's hoping to \\"sneak into the lineup\\" against Toronto, but Cooper has given no indication if Connolly will play. Ben Bishop should be back in goal after Evgeni Nabokov made 31 saves against the Islanders. Bishop is 8-1-1 in his last 10 starts and has a 1.72 goals-against average in his past four. It's uncertain who the Leafs will go with in net after Tuesday's disastrous performance. Jonathan Bernier was pulled before the second period after allowing three goals on 12 shots, and James Reimer gave up six for the second straight game after taking the loss against the Sabres. \\"We need a better performance from everybody,\\" Carlyle said. \\"Goaltending is part of that.\\" Tampa Bay has won the last two meetings. Steven Stamkos had a hat trick in a 5-3 victory March 19 - giving him four goals and two assists in his last three against the Leafs - before Palat scored twice in a 3-0 win April 8.","completion":"The Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team has not been playing well recently, and they lost three games in a row. Their coach, Randy Carlyle, knows they need to improve quickly. The players are feeling a lot of pressure to do better. They will play against the Tampa Bay Lightning team next.

Answer based on context: In the aftermath of the Clemenceau negotiations in January 1920, violent attacks against French forces occurred sporadically across Syria and effectively the Syrian Congress assembled in March 1920 to declare Faisal the king of Syria, as well as to officially set up the Arab Kingdom of Syria with Hashim al-Atassi as Prime Minister. An independent Arab Kingdom of Syria was proclaimed in Damascus on March 8, 1920, in an apparent dispute with the French over the nature of its rule. This action was immediately repudiated by the British and French and the San Remo Conference was called together by the League of Nations in April 1920 to explicitly establish the mandate of the French over Syria. Shortly, the war of Syrian Arab nationalists with the French became a devastating campaign for the new proclaimed Arab Kingdom of Syria. Several violent incidents in the region initiated by Arab militias, like the Battle of Tel Hai, led to further international support of the French. The League of Nations having given the French Mandate of Syria as planned, the French General Gouraud issued an ultimatum to the Syrian government to disband its troops and submit to French control. Worried about the results of a long bloody fight with the French, King Faisal himself surrendered on July 14, 1920, but his message would not reach the general and King Faisal's defense minister Yusuf al-'Azma, who ignoring the King, led an army to Maysalun to defend Syrian Arab Kingdom from French advance. The Hashemite government of Damascus submitted reluctantly to the French ultimatum and disbanded its troops. How many months was it between the Clemenceau negotiations and when King Faisal surrendered himself?","completion":"The Clemenceau negotiations occurred in January 1920, and King Faisal surrendered on July 14, 1920.

Choices: - sweating - relaxation - revenge - shivering - loss of heat The rationale to choose \\"relaxation\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the given choices In this task, we have to select the most appropriate reason for James cooling off in the pool on a hot summer day. Let's go through each of the given choices and analyze their relation to the situation: - Sweating: Since it's a hot summer day, it's possible that James might have been sweating, but it doesn't directly explain why he chose to cool off in the pool. - Relaxation: Cooling off in the pool on a hot day can provide a feeling of relaxation and comfort. - Revenge: This choice doesn't seem relevant to the situation, as there's no mention of any conflict or reason for revenge. - Shivering: This is not consistent with the context, as shivering usually occurs when someone's feeling cold, not on a hot summer day. - Loss of heat: This choice might have some relation to James cooling off in the pool, as being in the water can help in losing heat from the body. However, it lacks the clear intention of the activity. Step 2: Compare available choices Comparing the choices, we find that \\"relaxation\\" is the most suitable and justifiable reason that explains why James was cooling off in the pool.

One was a 94-yard pass to Robert Woods (the third-longest touchdown pass in Rams history) and 1 a pass to Sammy Watkins. Meanwhile, the Rams defense caused 4 turnovers on the Texans 2 of which were strip sack recoveries from Connor Barwin and Samson Ebukam while the other 2 were interceptions (one was by strong safety Blake Countess). The game ended in a Rams victory with a 33-7 score and the fourth-straight win. With that win, the Rams improved to 7-2, their best start in a season since 2001.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What cannot reproduce by themselves?\\" is viruses, specifically referencing the example provided by the teacher, which is the Influenza virus from the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses are unique and complex microscopic entities that dwell at the edge of what constitutes living organisms. Unlike cells, they lack the necessary components to carry out basic life-sustaining processes such as metabolism and reproduction by themselves. Instead, viruses must infect host cells and hijack their internal machinery to reproduce and propagate. The Influenza virus, belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae, is a prime example of a virus that cannot reproduce without a host cell. Often causing seasonal flu, the Influenza virus infects humans and animals, using their cells to create new copies of itself. The virus enters a host cell and takes over its functions, forcing the cell to produce copies of the virus's genetic material and protein components. These components are then assembled into new virus particles, which eventually burst out of the host cell and infect neighboring cells. This process leads to the spread of the virus throughout the organism, causing the flu symptoms we commonly experience. In summary, viruses, specifically the Influenza virus from the Orthomyxoviridae family, cannot reproduce by themselves and must rely on host cells to propagate and continue their life cycle.

Needing a hostage to aid their escape, Butch grabs the boy, who meekly accompanies them.

He was attested since the Old Kingdom together with his wife Amaunet. With the 11th dynasty (21st century BC), he rose to the position of patron deity of Thebes by replacing Monthu. - The son of Shoshenq I and his chief consort, Karomat A, Osorkon I was the second king of Egypt's 22nd Dynasty and ruled around 922 BC 887 BC. He succeeded his father Shoshenq I who probably died within a year of his successful 923 BC campaign against the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Osorkon I's reign is known for many temple building projects and was a long and prosperous period of Egypt's History. His highest known date is a \\"Year 33 Second Heb Sed\\" inscription found on the bandage of Nakhtefmut's Mummy which held a bracelet inscribed with Osorkon I's praenomen: \\"Sekhemkheperre\\". This date can only belong to Osorkon I since no other early Dynasty 22 king ruled for close to 30 years until the time of Osorkon II. Other mummy linens which belong to his reign include three separate bandages dating to his Regnal Years 11, 12, and 23 on the mummy of Khonsmaakheru in Berlin. The bandages are anonymously dated but definitely belong to his reign because Khonsmaakheru wore leather bands that contained a \\"menat-tab\\" naming Osorkon I. Secondly, no other king who ruled around Osorkon I's reign had a 23rd Regnal Year including Shoshenq I who died just before the beginning of his Year 22. - King Usermaatre Setepenre/Setepenamun Shoshenq III ruled Egypt's 22nd Dynasty for 39 years according to contemporary historical records. Two Apis Bulls were buried in the fourth and 28th years of his reign and he celebrated his Heb Sed Jubilee in his regnal year 30. Little is known of the precise basis for his successful claim to the throne since he was not a son of Osorkon II and Shoshenq's parentage and family ties are unknown. - Usermaatre Setepenamun Osorkon II was the fifth pharaoh of the Twenty-second Dynasty of Ancient Egypt and the son of Takelot I and Queen Kapes. He ruled Egypt around 872 BC to 837 BC from Tanis, the capital of this Dynasty. After succeeding his father, he was faced with the competing rule of his cousin, king Harsiese A, who controlled both Thebes and the Western Oasis of Egypt. Osorkon feared the serious challenge posed by Harsiese's kingship to his authority but, when Harsiese conveniently died in 860 BC, Osorkon II ensured that this problem would not recur by appointing his own son Nimlot C as the next High Priest of Amun at Thebes. This consolidated the pharaoh's authority over Upper Egypt and meant that Osorkon II ruled over a united Egypt. Osorkon II's reign would be a time of large scale monumental building and prosperity for Egypt. - Pedubastis I or Pedubast I was an Upper Egyptian Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt during the 9th century BC. Based on lunar dates which are known to belong to the reign of his rival in Upper Egypt Takelot II and the fact that Pedubast I first appeared as a local king at Thebes around Year 11 of Takelot II's rule, Pedubast I is today believed to have had his accession date in either 835 BC or 824 BC. This local Pharaoh is recorded as being of ancient Libyan ancestry and ruled Egypt for 25 years according to the redaction of Manetho done by Eusebius. He first became king at Thebes in Year 8 of Shoshenq III and his highest dated Year is his 23rd Year according to Nile Level Text No. 29. This year is equivalent to Year 31 of Shoshenq III of the Tanis based 22nd Dynasty of Egypt; however, since Shoshenq II only controlled Lower Egypt in Memphis and the Delta region, Pedubast and Shoshenq III were not political rivals and may even have established a relationship. Indeed, Shoshenq III's son, the general and army leader Pashedbast B \\"built a vestibule door to Pylon X at Karnak, and in one and the same commemorative text thereon named his father as [king] Sheshonq (III)\\" but dated his actions here to Pedubast I. This may show some tacit support for the Pedubast faction by the Tanite based 22nd dynasty king Shoshenq III. - Heqakheperre Shoshenq II or Shoshenq IIa was a pharaoh of the 22nd dynasty of Egypt. He was the only ruler of this Dynasty whose tomb was not plundered by tomb robbers. His final resting place was discovered within an antechamber of Psusennes I's tomb at Tanis by Pierre Montet in 1939. Montet removed the coffin lid of Shoshenq II on March 20, 1939, in the presence of king Farouk of Egypt himself. It proved to contain a large number of jewel-encrusted bracelets and pectorals, along with a beautiful hawkheaded silver coffin and a gold funerary mask. The gold facemask had been placed upon the head of the king. Montet later discovered the intact tombs of two Dynasty 21 kingsPsusennes I and Amenemope a year later in February and April 1940 respectively. Shoshenq II's prenomen, Heqakheperre Setepenre, means \\"The manifestation of Ra rules, the chosen one of Ra.\\" - Hedjkheperre Setepenre Shoshenq I (Egyptian \\"ššnq\\"), (reigned c.943-922 BCE) also known as Sheshonk or Sheshonq I (for discussion of the spelling, see Shoshenq) was a pharaoh of ancient Egypt and the founder of the Twenty-second Dynasty. Of ancient Libyan (Meshwesh-Berber) ancestry, Shoshenq I was the son of Nimlot A, Great Chief of the Ma, and his wife Tentshepeh A, a daughter of a Great Chief of the Ma herself. He is presumed to be the Shishaq mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, and his exploits are carved on the Bubastite Portal at Karnak. - King Hedjkheperre Setepenamun Harsiese or Harsiese A, is viewed by the Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen in his \\"Third Intermediate Period in Egypt\\", to be both a \\"High Priest of Amun\\" and the son of the High Priest of Amun Shoshenq C. The archaeological evidence does suggest that he was indeed Shoshenq C's son. However, recent published studies by the German Egyptologist Karl Jansen-Winkeln in \\"JEA\\" 81 (1995) have demonstrated that all the monuments of the first (king) Harsiese show that he was never a High Priest of Amun in his own right. Rather both Harsiese A and his son [...du] whose existence is known from inscriptions on the latter's funerary objects at Coptos are only attested as Ordinary Priests of Amun. Instead, while Harsiese A was certainly an independent king at Thebes during the first decade of Osorkon II's kingship, he was a different person from a second person who was also called Harsiese: Harsiese B. Harsiese B was the genuine High Priest of Amun who is attested in office late in Osorkon II's reign, in the regnal year 6 of Shoshenq III and in regnal years 18 and 19 of Pedubast I, according to Jansen-Winkeln. - Thutmose I (sometimes read as \\"Thothmes,\\" \\"Thutmosis\\" or \\"Tuthmosis I\\", meaning \\"Thoth-Born\\") was the third pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Egypt. He received the throne after the death of the previous king, Amenhotep I. During his reign, he campaigned deep into the Levant and Nubia, pushing the borders of Egypt farther than ever before. He also built many temples in Egypt, and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings; he is the first king confirmed to have done this (though Amenhotep I may have preceded him). - Shoshenq C was the eldest son of the 22nd Dynasty pharaoh Osorkon I and queen Maatkare, the daughter of Psusennes II, and served as the High Priest of Amun at Thebes during his father's reign. Consequently, he was the most important official in Upper Egypt after the king himself. He has generally been equated with Heqakheperre Shoshenq II by the English Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen and viewed as a short-lived co-regent to his father based on the Nile God British Museum statue 8 which identifies him as the son of Osorkon I and Queen Maatkare, daughter of Hor-Psusennes but this assumption is unproven. In the statue, Shoshenq C is called \\"the Master of the Two Lands\\" and the formula \\"beloved of Amun\\" is enclosed within a royal cartouche. However, in the text of the statue, he is not given a specific throne name or prenomen, the use of a cartouche by a royal prince is attested in other periods of Egyptian history such as that of Amenmes, son of Thutmose I, and the documents depicts Shoshenq C as a simple High Priest of Amun on the side of the legs of the Nile God, rather than a king. - Upper Egypt (', shortened to ' ) is the strip of land on both sides of the Nile that extends between Nubia and downriver (northwards) to Lower Egypt. - Harsiese B was a High Priest of Amun in 874 BC. Earlier Egyptologists assumed he was both the High Priest of Amun ( HPA ) and son of the High Priest Shoshenq C , who may have become a king at Thebes . However , recent research by Karl Jansen - Winkeln shows that all the monuments of the first ( King ) Harsiese A demonstrate that he was never High Priest of Amun in his own right , merely a regular Priest of Amun . While the earlier Harsiese was certainly a king at Thebes , he is clearly a different person from the later Harsiese , Harsiese B , who is attested as a High Priest of Amun . Jansen - Winkeln further shows that Harsiese A 's son , ( ... du ) , was only an ordinary Priest of Amun . Harsiese B is first explicitly attested as High Priest of Amun late under Osorkon II 's reign on Statue CGC 42225 , which bears this king 's cartouche . He likely assumed the office at Thebes when the current High Priest , Takelot F , proclaimed himself as king Takelot II in the final 3 years of Osorkon II 's reign . Statue CGC 42225 was dedicated by the \`\` Letter Writer to Pharaoh '' , Hor IX , who is mentioned on the walls of Temple J at Karnak . Temple J was built in the final years of Osorkon II 's reign by the then serving HPA , Takelot F. Hor IX later served under Pedubast I and Usermaatre Meryamun Shoshenq VI , who were direct contemporaries of Shoshenq III of the Twenty - second Dynasty . Shoshenq III once even dispatched his second son , Pashedbast B , to Thebes where the latter \`\` added a vestibule door to Pylon X at Karnak , dating it to the reign of Pedubast . '' Hor IX served beyond the 25 - year reign of Pedubast I and lived into Shoshenq VI 's reign under whom his funerary cones were inscribed . Consequently , the High Priest of Amun Harsiese can only be Harsiese B since he was a close contemporary of Hor IX and served late in office under Osorkon II. In contrast , Harsiese A died before the twelfth regnal year of Osorkon II. Harsiese B is also attested in office in the sixth regnal year of Shoshenq III in... - Kenneth Anderson Kitchen (born in 1932) is a British Bible scholar, Ancient Near Eastern historian, and Personal and Brunner Professor Emeritus of Egyptology and Honorary Research Fellow at the School of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool, England. He is one of the leading experts on the ancient Egyptian Ramesside Period (i.e., Dynasties 19-20), and the Third Intermediate Period, as well as ancient Egyptian chronology, having written over 250 books and journal articles on these and other subjects since the mid-1950s. He has been described by \\"The Times\\" as \\"the very architect of Egyptian chronology\\". - Titkheperure or Tyetkheperre Psusennes II <nowiki>[</nowiki>Greek <nowiki>]</nowiki> or Hor-Pasebakhaenniut II <nowiki>[</nowiki>Egyptian \\"r-p3-sb3--<n>-nwt\\"<nowiki>]</nowiki>, was the last king of the Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt. His royal name means \\"Image of the transformations of Re\\" in Egyptian. Psusennes II is often considered the same person as the High-Priest of Amun known as Psusennes III. The Egyptologist Karl Jansen-Winkeln notes that an important graffito from the Temple of Abydos contains the complete titles of a king \\"Tyetkheperre Setepenre Pasebakhaenniut Meryamun\\" \\"who is simultaneously called the HPA (i.e., High Priest of Amun) and supreme military commander.\\" This suggests that Psusennes was both king at Tanis and the High Priest in Thebes at the same time, meaning he did not resign his office as High Priest of Amun during his reign. The few contemporary attestations from his reign include the aforementioned graffito in Seti I's Abydos temple, an ostracon from Umm el-Qa'ab, an affiliation at Karnak and his presumed burial which consists of a gilded coffin with a royal uraeus and a Mummy, found in an antechamber of Psusennes I's tomb at Tanis. He was a High Priest of Amun at Thebes and the son of Pinedjem II and Istemkheb. His daughter Maatkare B was the Great Royal Wife of Osorkon I.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: This brief book is aimed at high school students, but speaks to anyone learning at any stage of life. Its formal, serious style closely matches its content, a school-masterly book on schooling.The author, W.H.Armstrong, starts with the basics: reading and writing.In his opinion, reading doesn't just mean recognizing each word on the page; it means taking in the information, digesting it and incorporating it into oneself just as one digests a sandwich and makes it a part of himself.The goal is to bring the information back to life, not just to treat it as dead facts on paper from dead trees.Reading and writing cannot be completely separated from each other; in fact, the aim of reading is to express the information you have got from the text.I've seen it again and again:some-one who can't express an idea after reading a text is just as ineffective as someone who hasn't read it at all. Only a third of the book remains after that discussion, which Armstrong devotes to specific tips for studying languages, math, science and history.He generally handles these topics thoroughly and equally, except for some weakness in the science and math sections and a bit too much passion regarding history to his students, that was a hundred times more than my history teachers ever got across.To my disappointment, in this part of the book he ignores the arts.As a matter of fact, they demand all the concentration and study that math and science do, though the study differs slightly in kind.Although it's commonly believed that the arts can only be naturally acquired, actually, learning the arts is no more natural than learning French or mathematics. My other comment is that the text aged.The first edition apparently dates to the 1960s--none of the references seem newer than the late 1950s.As a result, the discussion misses the entire computer age. These are small points, though, and don't affect the main discussion.I recommend it to any student and any teacher, including the self-taught student.

Article: Elshijh, an Egyptian doctoral candidate at Beijing Language and Cultural University, said he felt fairly excited when he learned that Mo Yan had won the literary prize. \\"Mo's winning of the prize is pushing Egypt to translate more of his works into Arabic,\\" Elshijh said, adding that there is already an Arabic edition of \\"Red Sorghum,\\" but Egypt's Ministry of Culture recently announced that it will translate another of Mo's works from Chinese to Arabic. Although Chinese literature is getting more attention around the world, translated versions of Chinese works remain in small supply in places like the United States and Europe. Jonathan Chuck, an American who has been working in social media for three years in China, has read some ancient Chinese classics in Englishand can name several ancient poets such as Li Bai. Chuck said works of Chinese literature are hard to get in the United States, as bookstores simply don't carry many English translations. \\"Besides, China is considered a mysterious country and far away from our daily life.\\" Chuck said when he was in school, pupils mostly studied Western literature translated from French, German and Portuguese, not literature translated from Asian languages. \\"China's Nobel prize will inspire more Westerners to notice Chinese literature, and I may read some of Mo's works,\\" he added. Li Ling, a professor at Beijing Language and Cultural University, said Chinese literature has less of a market than English-language literature because Western culture is the dominant culture. Moreover, it is difficult to fully express some Chinese words in English, which can limit Chinese literature to a Chinese-literate audience, Li added. \\"Western readers are more picky about what they read,\\" he said, explaining that if a Chinese book is not translated well, it would be \\" _ \\" to recommend it to Western readers.

The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed.

Title: Rock Star Movie plot: Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) is a Pittsburgh fanatical admirer of a 1980s heavy metal band called Steel Dragon. By day, Chris is a photocopier technician and by night, he is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band called Blood Pollution (the name is taken from a Steel Dragon song).

Chris experiences his own strife with his Blood Pollution bandmates, particularly guitarist Rob Malcolm (Timothy Olyphant). During a live performance, Rob's playing fails to live up to Chris' over-demanding standards regarding note-for-note accuracy to the original Steel Dragon recordings, and Chris sabotages Rob's amplifier mid-song - a fight breaks out between the two onstage. The next day, Chris arrives at Blood Pollution's rehearsal space (the basement of an X-rated theater) to find that he's been fired and replaced with his arch-rival, the (now former) lead singer of another Steel Dragon tribute band. Rob also cites Chris' inability to create his own musical style, preferring to remain the singer in a tribute band. One day in 1984, Chris receives an unexpected phone call from Steel Dragon's founder and rhythm guitarist, Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West), and is offered an audition for the band (thanks to two of Blood Pollution's groupies, who showed Kirk a videotape of one of Blood Pollution's concerts).

Unacceptable The sentence \\"That he is clever is eager to be obvious\\" is linguistically unacceptable. The sentence structure is awkward, and the meaning of the sentence is unclear. Moreover, the sentence appears to use incorrect syntax and some inappropriate word choices. In fact, this sentence violates several core linguistic principles, which I will outline below. 1. Poor syntax: The phrase \\"is eager to be obvious\\" attempts to describe \\"That he is clever,\\" but it does not fit properly within the sentence. It results in a sentence that does not follow the standard rules of syntax in the English language. 2. Inappropriate word choice: The word \\"eager\\" typically refers to a person or an animate being with feelings, emotions, and desires. In this context, it does not make sense to use \\"eager\\" to describe the relationship between \\"clever\\" and \\"obvious.\\" 3. Ambiguity: The sentence is ambiguous as it does not convey a clear meaning. The reader cannot understand if the sentence wants to describe someone clever desiring to be obvious or if the cleverness of an individual is evident. To create a linguistically acceptable sentence, you can restructure it in a way that resolves the aforementioned issues. Here is an example of a more acceptable sentence with a similar meaning: \\"His cleverness is obvious to everyone\\" or \\"He is evidently clever.\\" These sentences make use of an appropriate syntax, clear meaning, and suitable word choices to convey the intended ideas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard's backlog of 15 ships. The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said. \\"The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business. Everything will be taken over by the new company,\\" said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. Once its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities. Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said. Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa (23.5 million). Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said.

Write a summary based on this article: While scanning parenting blogs and sites yesterday, I came across an article on Huffington Post about a restaurant receipt with a note from a “single mom.” I was initially a little amused that this was making the rounds because it seems so silly. Who really cares if someone, single mom or not, left a tip? It’s rude in the extreme, but hardly worthy of public discussion. The more I thought about it, though, I realized it wasn’t funny at all. The restaurant patron, who left no tip on a 138.55 bill, signing, “Single Mom, sorry,” may or may not have been a single mom. I think the diner was not really a single parent, or at least not one who couldn’t afford a tip, but rather someone trying to imply that some single moms feel like they are entitled to a pass because they are struggling financially. The note on the receipt (if it was indeed a joke), and the reaction it has drawn online, points to a larger issue. Increasingly, it seems, single moms are being used as the butt of jokes or, even worse, a scapegoat for societal ills. What do you think? Is this receipt real? Is the incident indicative of a larger, mostly negative, attitude toward single mothers? Related content: Momspeak: Who speaks for the single parent? Debate over AU professor should be about supporting working parents, not breast-feeding ||||| A photo of a receipt allegedly left by a single mother at a restaurant has gone viral after it was originally posted on Reddit. The bill shows a charge for a 138.35 meal with no additional tip. Instead, there's a note that reads \\"single mom sorry\\" -- implying that whoever signed the bill doesn't have enough money because it is expensive to raise kids alone. Redditor PhoenixSongFawkes posted the photo and wrote, \\"I'm sure 140 could have gotten you and your kids a week worth of groceries, but instead you spend it one one meal?! For shame!\\" (Story continues below photo.) Commenters, including many single moms, were outraged. RedheadedBanshee wrote, \\"I'm a single Mom, and this is bullshit. What exactly are you teaching your kids? ... Dear Parents of all kinds - your kids are watching you and learning.\\" Dozens of commenters suggested that if a person -- single mom or not -- can't afford to leave a tip, that she shouldn't have gone out to eat at all and that whoever left this note is in the wrong. Lindsay Cross, a blogger for Mommyish and former single mom, has another theory. Cross doesn't believe that the receipt is legitimate. \\"It’s completely possible that someone wanted to be an asshole and blame it on single moms. Honestly, the more I think about how anyone would do this to a waitress, the more I think it’s likely that this was just a very awful prank to make single moms look bad,\\" she wrote. Though Cross makes it apparent that she isn't trying to stereotype single moms, she notes that moms who raise kids on their own are generally sympathetic to those in service positions and mostly try to help those who are working hard. But on the other hand, as Cross and many commenters argued, \\"jerks\\" come in all shapes and sizes. (h/t Mommyish) |||||","completion":"The article discusses an incident that took place in a restaurant where a patron left no tip on their 138.55 bill, instead, they left a note stating, “Single Mom, sorry.” The receipt initially caught attention after being posted online, ending up in several parenting blogs and websites, and sparking a significant amount of public discourse. The patron's identity remains unknown, making it unclear whether or not they were indeed a single mom. It's suggested that the diner might not necessarily be a single parent, or at least not one who couldn’t afford a tip, but rather someone attempting to assert the notion that some single moms feel entitled to exemptions under the guise of financial hardship. The posted receipt and the subsequent online reaction have signaled a broader societal issue. The argument in the article points out how single moms are increasingly used as a target for humor or even negatively used to represent societal problems. The controversy over the authenticity of the receipt stems from contrasting perspectives. Some, including single moms, expressed their outrage over the incident, indicating that providing a tip is a standard expectation when dining out, regardless of personal circumstances, and that not doing so sends a poor message to children. They argue that if someone - single mom or not - cannot afford to tip, they should not dine out at all. Conversely, Lindsay Cross, a blogger and former single mom, holds the theory that the receipt might not be legitimate. She theorizes that it could simply be a distasteful prank intended to shed negative light on single moms. Cross mentions that single moms who raise children on their own tend to understand and empathize with individuals in service roles and often seek to assist those who work hard. However, she also emphasizes that discourteous behavior is not exclusive to any particular demographic. In summary, the incident reflects potential biases and stereotypes associated with single parents and raises questions about the authenticity of the narrative depicted in the receipt, leading to a more profound discussion about societal attitudes towards single mothers. The discourse eventually underlines the essence of empathy and mature behavior regardless of one's personal circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity, founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement, rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils, but rejecting the latest ecumenical council, the Council of Trent.

American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. After reading the above, is \\"Flight 11's route changed\\" the correct answer to the question \\"When The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft what further steps by America 11 alarmed them?\\"?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Smart Exercise Doctors are starting to find more and more information that suggests a connection between exercise and brain development. Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health and prefix = st1 /ScienceUniversity, studies brain development. According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels, including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed. Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better. As she says: \\"While we already know that exercise is good for the heart, exercise can literally cause physical changes in the brain.\\" The effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies. Babies who do activities that require a lot of movement and physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active. With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. \\"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses. They need to establish a connection between motion and memory. In this way, as they get older, children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning,\\" says Margaret. Older people can beef uptheir brains as well.CornellUniversitystudied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine. Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising just three hours a week. The exercise does not have to be very difficult, but it does have to increase the heart rate. Also, just like the motion for infants, exercise for older people should involve some complexity. Learning some new skills or motions helps to open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time. For most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful. The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood. And your brain can benefit from as little as two to three hours of exercise a week. Answer the following questions: 1. Are doctors starting to think there is a connection between exercise and brain development? 2. What does judy Cameron's research say about the topic? 3. Can exercise cause physical changes in the brain? 4. What does it say children need to associalte physical activity with? 5.

It was located in the area where the navigable Ljubljanica came closest to Castle Hill. The river played an important role as a transport route for the trade between the city and the rest of Roman empire. From the late 4th to the late 6th century, Emona was the seat of a bishopric that had intensive contacts with the ecclesiastical circle of Milan, reflected in the architecture of the early Christian complex along Erjavec Street in present-day Ljubljana. - The Gulf of Trieste (, ) is a very shallow bay of the Adriatic Sea, in the extreme northern part of the Adriatic Sea.

Pine city was located in the mountains, and was inhabited by nature lovers and people that protected the environment. Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city contributed less to the creation of dead zones? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, Pine city contributed less to the creation of dead zones in comparison to Bird city. To understand why, we must first look at the main factors contributing to dead zones and the differences in economy and practices between Pine city and Bird city. Marine pollution, particularly the contribution of hazardous chemicals and particles in the ocean, is primarily caused by rivers. Agricultural fertilizer chemicals, livestock waste, and human waste play a significant role in the creation of dead zones, leading to an excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals, hypoxia, and the formation of dead zones. Marine debris, including human-created waste, is another factor contributing to marine pollution. Bird city's economy relies on conventional agriculture using fertilizers for their crops. The city is situated along a large river flowing into the sea, making it more susceptible to contribution to marine pollution and dead zones. The use of fertilizers causes an increase in nutrient pollution, which flows from the river into surrounding water bodies. Excessive nutrient pollution in water bodies stimulates algal blooms, depleting oxygen levels and creating dead zones. On the other hand, Pine city is located in the mountains and is home to nature lovers and people committed to protecting the environment. Due to these factors, it can be inferred that Pine city's agricultural practices may be more focused on environmentally friendly and sustainable methods. Moreover, the mountainous terrain of Pine city implies that it has limited direct access to marine bodies, reducing the likelihood of contributing to marine pollution and dead zones. Additionally, local residents' commitment to environmental preservation would presumably lead to conscious efforts in reducing human waste and marine debris. Therefore, considering the differences in their agricultural practices, geographic locations, and philosophical approach towards the environment, Pine city is likely to have contributed less to the creation of dead zones compared to Bird city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Her notable roles in film and theatre include playing Constanze Mozart in the 1984 film \\"Amadeus,\\" Officer Eve Eggers on \\"The John Larroquette Show\\" (1993-1996), and various performances on stage. The assumption that Elizabeth Berridge was nominated for an Emmy more than twice is not directly supported by the information provided. Emmys are awarded to recognize outstanding achievement in the television industry, and while Berridge has certainly had a successful career in film and television, it's important to consult records and archives to determine her specific Emmy nomination history.

Which language is this?","completion":"The phrase \\"Podvozek bez bradavek\\" is in Czech, a West Slavic language primarily spoken in the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak and has similarities to other Slavic languages such as Polish and Russian. In English, the phrase \\"Podvozek bez bradavek\\" can be translated to \\"Chassis without nipples.\\" However, the translation appears somewhat random and doesn't form a coherent sentence or thought. It's crucial to consider the context in which the phrase appears to understand its accurate meaning fully. The Czech language uses the Latin script with several additional diacritic marks to differentiate the unique Czech sounds. It has a rich literary history, with some well-known Czech authors such as Franz Kafka, Jaroslav Hašek, and Karel Čapek contributing significantly to the world's literary canon. Czech and Slovak were considered intelligible even after the Austro-Hungarian Empire split in 1918 and Czechoslovakia was formed. After the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia emerged as independent nations. However, the languages remain mutually intelligible to a great extent. The Czech language, like other Slavic languages, has a highly inflected grammar with complex noun declensions that denote case, number, and gender, as well as varying verb conjugations based on tense, mood, and aspect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Boleslaw later repelled invasions from Otto's successor and then sought Poland's own expansion eastward Sentence 2: Boleslaw sought to expand Poland's southern border. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The truthfulness of the second sentence cannot be definitively determined just from the information provided in the first sentence. The two sentences discuss different aspects of Boleslaw's reign and intentions as a ruler. Let's analyze both sentences in-depth to understand the situation better. Sentence 1: \\"Boleslaw later repelled invasions from Otto's successor and then sought Poland's own expansion eastward.\\" This sentence reveals that Boleslaw, presumably a ruler or leader of Poland, managed to defend his territory against invasions from the successor of Otto, likely referring to a ruler from a neighboring region or empire. The sentence also states that Boleslaw aimed to expand Poland's territory in an eastward direction. The focus of this sentence is on defense against external threats and eastward expansion. Sentence 2: \\"Boleslaw sought to expand Poland's southern border.\\" This sentence conveys another aspect of Boleslaw's intentions, which is the desire to boost the size of Poland towards the south. It indicates an intention for expansion in a different direction than stated in the first sentence. The first sentence establishes that Boleslaw was interested in expanding Poland territorially. However, it only confirms his interest in eastward expansion. The second sentence suggests a different direction for expansion - southward. From the information found in the first sentence alone, we cannot determine whether Boleslaw also pursued southern expansion. There is not enough evidence or information to clearly conclude if sentence 2 is true or false based solely on sentence 1.

The new album was publicised during Jay-Z's performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April, when a blimp flew across the venue announcing that M.I.A.'s new album would be released on 29 June 2010. M.I.A. promoted the album with a series of appearances at music festivals, including the Hard festival in New York and The Big Chill in Herefordshire. Her performance at the latter was cut short due to a stage invasion by fans. She also performed at the Flow Festival in Finland, where she was joined onstage by Derek E. Miller playing guitar during her performance of \\"Meds and Feds\\", and the LokerseFeesten in Lokeren, Flanders, Belgium, where her performance drew a crowd of 13,500, the biggest of the 10-day music festival. In September she announced a tour that would last until the end of the year.M.I.A. also promoted the album with an appearance on the \\"Late Show with David Letterman\\", during which she performed \\"Born Free\\" with Martin Rev of Suicide playing keyboards, backed by a group of dancers styled to look like M.I.A.

If yeah right so they had a lot of fun, can we conclude that \\"They hated it.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided, which states that \\"they had a lot of fun,\\" we cannot conclude that \\"They hated it.\\" In fact, the statement \\"They hated it\\" contradicts the idea that they had a lot of fun. It is important to carefully examine and interpret the information provided to draw accurate conclusions. The phrase \\"they had a lot of fun\\" suggests that the individuals in question enjoyed the experience, activity, or event. This implies that they took pleasure, happiness, or amusement out of what they did, and the overall outcome was positive and satisfying for them. On the other hand, the statement \\"They hated it\\" implies a strong dislike or aversion towards the experience, activity, or event. This denotes that the individuals involved did not enjoy themselves and felt either displeased or negatively affected by the situation. To reconcile the two conflicting pieces of information, we might consider the following possibilities: 1. Misinterpretation: It is possible that there has been some misinterpretation of the available information. The phrase \\"they had a lot of fun\\" could have been misread or misreported, leading to an incorrect conclusion. In this case, revisiting the source of the information can help clarify the true meaning and determine how the individuals in question felt about their experience. 2. Change of opinion: Another possibility is that the individuals' feelings about the experience have changed over time. They may have initially enjoyed the experience but later came to dislike it for some reason. In this scenario, it is essential to consider the timing and context of the information when drawing conclusions. 3. Irony or sarcasm: It could also be that the phrase \\"yeah right so they had a lot of fun\\" was meant to be sarcastic or ironic, meaning that they did not truly have a good time. In this instance, understanding the tone and context of the statement is crucial to grasp the intended meaning. It is essential to evaluate all relevant information and consider the context when drawing conclusions, especially when interpreting seemingly contradictory statements. In the provided example, without proper context and information, we cannot reasonably conclude that \\"They hated it\\" based on the statement that \\"they had a lot of fun.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the final step of the following process: - Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves - The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them Answer:","completion":"The final step in this process is the deposition of the eroded sediments and particles into new locations in the ocean, thus contributing to the constant reshaping of underwater landforms and the coastline. As the waves recede back into the ocean, carrying sediments and small rocks acquired from the beach, they eventually lose energy and slow down. When the energy from the waves is no longer sufficient to transport the sediments, these particles slowly settle to the ocean floor. This settling of particles is known as deposition, and it typically occurs in deeper waters where the current is less forceful, or in sheltered areas like bays and estuaries. Over time, this process can create new underwater landforms, such as sandbars, barrier islands, and offshore shoals, which in turn provide habitats for marine life and influence the dynamics of ocean ecosystems. In some instances, these newly deposited sediments may eventually be transported back to the shoreline by the same processes which produced them, thus continuing the cycle of erosion, transport, and deposition. This entire process, known as coastal sedimentation or coastal erosion, plays a crucial role in shaping our coastlines and the diverse ecosystems that exist along them. It is an ongoing natural process that is affected by various factors, including weather, tides, currents, and human activities. As a result, understanding the dynamics and consequences of coastal sedimentation is important for effective coastal management and conservation practices, as well as for assessing the potential impacts of climate change on coastal areas."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Read this and answer the question Traditionally, the first step in most Buddhist schools requires taking refuge in the Three Jewels (Sanskrit: tri-ratna, Pāli: ti-ratana)[web 19] as the foundation of one's religious practice. The practice of taking refuge on behalf of young or even unborn children is mentioned in the Majjhima Nikaya, recognized by most scholars as an early text (cf. Infant baptism). Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the lama. In Mahayana, the person who chooses the bodhisattva path makes a vow or pledge, considered the ultimate expression of compassion. In Mahayana, too, the Three Jewels are perceived as possessed of an eternal and unchanging essence and as having an irreversible effect: \\"The Three Jewels have the quality of excellence. Just as real jewels never change their faculty and goodness, whether praised or reviled, so are the Three Jewels (Refuges), because they have an eternal and immutable essence. These Three Jewels bring a fruition that is changeless, for once one has reached Buddhahood, there is no possibility of falling back to suffering. What type of Buddhism adds a fourth refuge?","completion":"Tibetan Buddhism is the type of Buddhism that sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the lama."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For food he traps wild animals, fishes in the rivers, and plants whatever he can. John lives in a cabin he made by hand, out of trees he chopped down with an ax. Though he has no s he knows of, he does have a deer he raised from a fawn. The deer lives in the house in the winter and goes with John when he goes into the forest for food. Nobody lives within fifty miles of his cabin in the mountains and John has not been out of the mountains during the entire forty years. One day last year I hiked in to see how John lives. It was like going back in time. There were no roads, no stores, no noise, no pollution, not even a post office. Most notable of all, there were no people and that's just the way John Williams wants to keep his part of the world--without people. But there is a paradox in his story. John is an educated man. He has books and nobody knows how he got them. Mostly he reads about his world, the forest, the animals, the plants, and the mountains. He has seen airplanes flying overhead but does not want to know about them. For him, electricity is lightning, not light bulbs, refrigerators, televisions, or washing machines. John Williams is 85 years old and had not had a sick day in his life. He attributes his long life to the fact that it has nothing to do with people and in order that he might enjoy many more years of health, happiness, and solitude, I will not tell you where his kingdom lies.

Movie title: Veronika Decides to Die Context: A train in New York City carries passengers to work, including Veronika Deklava (Sarah Michelle Gellar). We see Veronika walking the streets of Manhattan, working at her job, meeting a young man for a drink afterward, and finally going home. During this time, she gives a voiceover as if talking to a psychiatrist who she thinks will put her on antidepressants, and she gives a prediction of her life all the way to her old age.At home, Veronika pours herself a drink and takes a number of prescription medications out of her bathroom medicine cabinet. She arranges the bottles in a line on her coffee table, and then lays out a number of pills. Putting on some music, Veronika swallows the pills one by one, washing them down with her drink.As the pills take effect, Veronika starts to type out an email to her parents, ominously telling them that none of what is about to happen, is their fault. Deleting the email, she picks up a fashion magazine and instead begins to type out an email to the Village Voice, lambasting them over a fashion slogan she sees as a lie. In the email Veronika lashes out at media and corporate misleading of the public to things that Veronika believes, really matter in life... and that she's committing suicide as the only viable escape from a world she sees as unreal.But in signing her real name, Veronika has not reckoned with the power of the internet. Within minutes, viewers have shared and spread the email, and traced it back to her, and a man is banging on her door even as she collapses in her living room. Bursting into the apartment, the man bends over Veronika, feeling for a pulse, and yells for 911 to be called. The unconscious Veronika is hurried to a hospital where doctors work feverishly to save her life.Veronika is brought to a private care facility called Villette.

Questions: If there is no windows in the area where are you likely to find a fire extinguisher? Options: - house - stairwell - school bus - window - garage The answer to this question is:","completion":"stairwell In line with common sense, the most likely place to find a fire extinguisher among the given options would be a stairwell. Here is a detailed explanation of each option to provide a clearer understanding: 1. House: Although fire extinguishers can be found in houses, they are not the only place where you can find them, and it is not a requirement for every house to have one. People usually keep them in different locations such as the kitchen, near electrical panels, or in laundry rooms. However, it is not specific enough to universally identify as the correct answer. 2. Stairwell: A stairwell is a logical and common place to find a fire extinguisher, especially in public and commercial buildings such as offices, hotels, hospitals, and schools. This is because they are easily accessible from various floors and are typically located close to exit routes, making them convenient in case of an emergency. It is the most suitable option among the listed choices. 3. School Bus: School buses may have a fire extinguisher on board, but it would not be the first place one would look for in case of an emergency, especially when the question implies an area with no windows. 4. Window: A window is not a relevant option in this context, as it is neither a place nor an area where a fire extinguisher is typically found. 5. Garage: It is possible to find a fire extinguisher in a garage, particularly if it is used as a workshop or stores flammable items. However, compared to stairwells in public and commercial buildings, the likelihood of finding a fire extinguisher in every garage is significantly lower. In conclusion, based on common sense, a stairwell is the most likely place to find a fire extinguisher among the options provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This means they're not the exact same thing, but they are a bit similar because ducks are a type of bird.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. After you make your first hit, you will need to reduce your target area to the spaces surrounding the space that was a hit. Since ships in Battleship range from 2-5 spaces long, it may take you several turns to sink the ship you have hit. Begin by striking above, below, or to one side of the space you have hit to discover and hit more of the ship. If one of your strikes is a miss, try the area on the opposite side of the space that was a hit. Keep striking until you have taken your opponent's battleship. You will know when you have taken your opponent's ship because players are required to announce when a ship has been sunk. After you have sunk the first of your opponent's ships, you will need to resume firing randomly (or in the center of the board) to find another ship. Then repeat the process of firing around the hit space until you have sunk another ship. Playing the game this way will reduce the amount of turns that it takes to sink all of your opponent's battleships and it will also increase your chances of winning the game. Summary:","completion":"1. Begin the game by firing randomly or targeting the center area of the board to maximize your chances of getting a hit. 2. Once you get your first hit, focus on the spaces surrounding the hit space. This is because ships are always placed in a horizontal or vertical line and can be 2-5 spaces long. 3.

The right side of the equation contains the terms 572 and 288. Combining these terms will simplify the equation: -517*b - 1105 = -648*b + (572 + 288) Now, add 572 and 288: -517*b - 1105 = -648*b + 860 Step 2: Isolate the variable b. Next, we want to isolate b by moving all terms with b to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. In this case, we'll move the -648*b term to the left side and the -1105 term to the right side. To do this, add 648*b to both sides and add 1105 to both sides: -517*b + 648*b = 860 + 1105 Combining the terms, we get: 131*b = 1965 Step 3: Solve for b.

Three members of Russian female punk rock band Pussy Riot were sentenced to two years in prison Friday after they were found guilty of hooliganism for performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in a church. The five months they have spent in detention since their arrests in March count toward the sentence, Judge Marina Sirovaya said. The judge said the charges against the three young women -- Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich -- had been proved by witnesses and the facts. The Pussy Riot members were charged after screaming, \\"Mother Mary, please drive Putin away,\\" in a protest act in February inside Christ Savior Cathedral, one of Moscow's grandest houses of worship. Punk bands perform in support of jailed rockers. Sirovaya rejected the women's defense that they were acting from political motives, ruling that they had intended to insult the Russian Orthodox Church and undermine public order. However, the fact that two of them have young children was a mitigating factor in the sentencing, the judge said. The defendants were accused of offending the churchgoers present -- through their actions, obscene language and their clothing -- and showing a lack of respect for the rules of the Orthodox Church. They ignored requests to stop their brief unscheduled protest performance, the court heard. While their actions outraged many of Russia's faithful, their high-profile trial prompted international concern about freedom of speech in Russia. Opinion: Why the Pussy Riot case matters. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said on its official Twitter feed that the sentence was \\"disproportionate.\\" European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton condemned the court's decision as \\"deeply troubling.\\" \\"Together with the reports of the band members' mistreatment during their pre-trial detention and the reported irregularities of the trial, it puts a serious question mark over Russia's respect for international obligations of fair, transparent, and independent legal process,\\" she said. Pussy Riot and Russia's surreal 'justice' \\"It also runs counter to Russia's international obligations as regards respect for freedom of expression.\\" Urging Russia to reverse the sentence, Ashton said the case \\"adds to the recent upsurge in politically motivated intimidation and prosecution of opposition activists in the Russian Federation, a trend that is of growing concern to the European Union.\\" Rights group Amnesty International said that the court's decision was \\"a bitter blow for freedom of expression in the country\\" and that the women were now \\"prisoners of conscience.\\" Amnesty believes that the women's conduct \\"was politically motivated, and that they were wrongfully prosecuted for what was a legitimate -- if potentially offensive -- protest action,\\" it said in a statement. Supporters vent anger on Twitter. John Dalhuisen, director of Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia Program, urged Russian authorities to overturn the sentence and release the trio unconditionally. He also highlighted recent measures \\"restricting the freedom of expression and association\\" introduced after a wave of popular protests that accompanied elections earlier this year. \\"This trial is another example of the Kremlin's attempts to discourage and delegitimize dissent. It is likely to backfire,\\" he said. Human Rights Watch also said the women should never have been prosecuted for a hate crime. \\"The charges and verdict against the Pussy Riot band members distort both the facts and the law,\\" Hugh Williamson, the rights group's Europe and Central Asia director, said in a statement. Band member's husband condemns Pussy Riot's prison sentences. Earlier, a number of arrests were made outside the court, where protesters gathered as the verdict was read, RIA Novosti reported. The women are expected to appeal the court's decision. The charge of hooliganism aimed at inciting religious hatred carried a potential sentence of up to seven years in prison. None of the three women is older than 30. They have been in custody since their arrest shortly after the unexpected performance. They looked calm and occasionally smiled and exchanged remarks as they stood, sometimes in handcuffs, behind a glass wall in the court, listening to the lengthy ruling. Moscow district court heard that the three worked together to carry out their \\"criminal act which violated public order\\" -- in an action that \\"went against tradition and is a great insult to the church and people.\\" The three wore revealing, brightly colored clothing and covered their faces with balaclava-style masks in a style \\"inappropriate\\" for a church before making use of a microphone and electric guitar, the court was told. Video footage of the \\"punk prayer\\" protest song was placed online, although the judge said it was not clear who had posted it. Sirovaya said that the apologies by the defendants \\"were not sincere\\" and described their conduct as \\"an unprecedented act of hooliganism by women.\\" Celebrities back Pussy Riot. Evidence from character witnesses for the three women was also read out. Alyokhina was described as being a writer of poetry, a vegan and a good mother, RIA Novosti said. Pop star Madonna last week performed Pussy Riot-style in a face mask and with the group's name on her back during a packed Moscow gig. She's one of a number of celebrities to back the women's cause. \\"Everyone has the right to free speech, everywhere in the world. Maria, Katya, Nadia, I pray for you,\\" Madonna said at Tuesday's concert, according to RIA Novosti. \\"They did something brave with their action. And I am praying for their freedom.\\" Rallies in support of Pussy Riot were also organized Friday outside Russian embassies around the world, including in London and Washington. Pussy Riot and Putin's iron fist. Putin criticized the women's action this month but said they should not be judged \\"too harshly,\\" RIA Novosti said. He added that he hoped the court makes \\"the right decision.\\" Pussy Riot specializes in sudden, often illegal public performances, including one in Moscow's Red Square. The \\"punk prayer\\" was inspired by the women's anger about the relationship between the Russian government and the Orthodox Church, according to the band's manager, who is married to one of the women. The Orthodox leader Patriarch Kyril has been widely reported as saying Putin's years in power have been a miracle from God. Putin won reelection to the presidency in March in a vote that international observers said did not meet international standards. The presidential election came just months after allegations of fraud in parliamentary elections prompted the largest anti-government demonstrations Russia had seen in two decades.

They were found guilty of hooliganism, which means behaving in a loud and rough way, and were sentenced to spend two years in prison. They sang, \\"Mother Mary, please drive Putin away,\\" as a way to protest inside a big beautiful church in Moscow. Some people in Russia were very angry with their actions, but others around the world were worried about their rights to free speech being taken away. The band members plan to appeal the court's decision and ask to be let out of prison.

Passage:Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993. The IIHF recognized the Czech Republic as the successor to Czechoslovakia, allowing the team to retain its position in the top World Championship division, while Slovakia started in the lowest division (Pool C) in 1994 and was forced to work its way up. Both nations competed in the tournament at the 1994 Winter Olympics, as did Russia. Slovakia and Finland both finished the preliminary round undefeated. Slovakia lost their medal round quarter-final game to Russia 2–3 OT, who later lost to Sweden 3–4 in the semi-final and Finland (who was defeated by Canada in the another semi-final) 0–4 in the bronze medal game. In the gold medal game between Sweden and Canada, both teams finished regulation and overtime play with a 2–2 tie. In the resulting shootout, the first in Olympic competition, both nations scored two goals, which resulted in a sudden death shootout. Peter Forsberg of Sweden scored one of the most famous goals in Olympic history by faking a forehand shot, then sliding a one-handed backhand shot past goaltender Corey Hirsch.

Write an article based on this summary: – A New York teenager has learned an anti-vaping lesson in the most painful of ways: An e-cigarette exploded in his face. Leor Domatov, 14, took a bus to the Kings Plaza mall in Brooklyn with friends last week and stopped at a vaping kiosk near the mall's entrance, where a clerk allowed the minor to handle products, reports the New York Daily News. But when the Plaza Vapes kiosk clerk connected the wrong battery to a vaporizer cartridge, it exploded—partially blinding the young teen as it pierced his corneas in both eyes and burned his hands, leaving a \\"large gash\\" in one of them, as the Daily News puts it. The eighth-grader tells the paper that he can't see out of his left eye and has a \\"little bit\\" of vision in his right. \\"The duty falls on Kings Plaza and the kiosk owner to make sure there are signs in place to warn the children,\\" the family's attorney tells Pix11. It's illegal in New York state for kids under 18 to buy e-cigarettes; New York City is even stricter, with the ban extending to anyone under 21. (Here's why vaping is illegal on US flights.) Article:","completion":"Title: The Harsh Reality of Vaping: New York Teenager Suffers Severe Injuries from E-Cigarette Explosion In what could be described as a terrible turn of events, a New York teenager, Leor Domatov, aged 14, faced a horrifying anti-vaping experience and learned a life-altering lesson. An e-cigarette exploded in Domatov's face, causing devastating injuries, exposing the hazards of vaping and the risks associated with e-cigarettes. Leor Domatov and his friends took a bus to the Kings Plaza Mall in Brooklyn to spend some time engaging in leisurely activities. However, the events that transpired changed Domatov's life forever. Upon entering the mall, the group of friends stopped at a vaping kiosk called Plaza Vapes, situated near the mall's entrance. Shockingly, there was no restriction on the teenager handling the products, with the kiosk clerk permitting him to access and experiment with them, as reported by the New York Daily News. Unbeknownst to them, this decision would have disastrous consequences. As the kiosk clerk connected the wrong battery to a vaporizer cartridge, the device exploded. The explosion partially blinded Domatov, inflicting severe eye injuries, piercing his corneas in both eyes. Moreover, the young teenager sustained burns to his hands, with one of them having a large gash as described by the Daily News. Currently, Domatov has no visibility in his left eye, only retaining a minimal amount of vision in his right eye. The incident has raised numerous questions on the regulations and safety measures surrounding vaping kiosks and e-cigarette usage in the state of New York. The family's attorney highlighted the responsibilities that fall on both the mall and the kiosk management, stating, \\"The duty falls on Kings Plaza and the kiosk owner to make sure there are signs in place to warn the children.\\" It is critical to note that it is illegal for individuals under 18 to buy e-cigarettes in New York state, with New York City enforcing an even stricter policy banning e-cigarette usage for anyone under 21. Despite such regulations being in place, the Plaza Vapes kiosk negligently allowed the young teenager to handle their products, leading to this tragic incident. Unfortunately, Domatov's case is not the first instance where e-cigarette users have faced severe health hazards due to device explosions. As vaping continues to gain popularity, particularly amongst young adults, the risks associated with e-cigarette usage must be taken seriously. E-cigarettes have been under scrutiny for their overall safety, chemical composition, and the claims surrounding them being a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes. Notably, vaping has been made illegal on all US flights to curb the potential risks it may pose during air travel. This incident serves as a stark reminder to be cautious while handling e-cigarettes and to spread awareness about the dangers of vaping. Furthermore, it should prompt kiosk owners and mall managements across the country to ensure strict adherence to regulations, preventing minors from purchasing and handling potentially hazardous vaping products. It is essential to strike a balance between enjoying leisure activities and considering the risks associated with those activities. For young teenagers like Leor Domatov, this lesson has come at an incredibly high cost. The increasing importance of awareness and education surrounding vaping cannot be emphasized enough to safeguard the well-being of unsuspecting individuals in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lola Wang, a 28-year-old marketing officer in Shanghai, makes a six-hour trip to Shandong province in eastern China to see her parents twice a year -- once during the Lunar New Year and again during the National Day holiday in October. \\"I feel like I should visit my parents more but having a job in the financial industry means I have to work long hours and sacrifice some of my personal time for work,\\" Wang, an only child, tells CNN. Wang's dilemma is faced by many young people in China, where a one-child policy and three decades of economic reforms have accelerated the decline of the traditional extended family. It's also a matter of concern for China's new leaders as they grapple with the burden of supporting the growing number of elderly people. New law. A new national law introduced this week requires the offspring of parents older than 60 to visit their parents \\"frequently\\" and make sure their financial and spiritual needs are met. \\"People are accusing young people of not visiting their parents enough,\\" says Wang, adding she agrees with the aims of the law. \\"Admittedly, some of them use their career and long working hours as an excuse.

The \\"Law of Protection of Rights and Interests of the Aged\\" was amended by China's legislature in December after a spate of reports about elderly parents neglected by their children. In one particularly horrific case in China's eastern Jiangsu province, a local television station reported that a farmer had kept his 100-year-old mother in a pigsty with a 440lb sow. Chen Shoutian told the station his mother had been happy to live there: \\"She wants to stay here because she feels it is convenient,\\" he said. A modest pension and social welfare system, particularly in rural areas, means elderly people are usually dependent on their children for support. More than a fifth live below the poverty line, according to figures from the National School of Development at Peking University. Changing values. Although respect for the elderly is still deeply engrained in Chinese society, traditional values like filial piety have been weakened by the country's rush to modernity. \\"The traditional family support system is eroding for many reasons and I think the government would like to slow this process down,\\" said Albert Park, the director of the Emerging Markets Institute at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The law stipulates that children cannot give up their inheritance rights in attempt to evade their duty to take care of their parents. It adds that children should pay a monthly allowance to their parents if they refuse to take care of them. The legislation also allows for the elderly to sue their children but does not specify the process or what penalties they might face. It may also prove difficult to enforce, says Ding Yiyuan from Beijing Yingke Law Firm. He told the Guangzhou Daily newspaper the law fails to qualify the word \\"frequently.\\" He added that few elderly people were likely to sue their own children. First case. On Tuesday, XInhua reported that a 77-year-old woman from Jiangsu city of Wuxi sued her daughter for neglecting her.

Instead, the text states that \\"Detroit is rearing to go on that,\\" where \\"that\\" likely refers to enacting pollution controls. The phrase \\"rearing to go\\" implies eagerness or readiness to proceed with something, so it shows that Detroit is keen on implementing pollution control measures, not hesitant. However, the text does suggest there are disagreements about how the pollution controls should be structured or implemented. It mentions a disagreement about whether pollution controls should be voluntary. But this doesn't necessarily imply hesitancy on the part of Detroit to enact pollution controls overall. It's more of a disagreement on the method and procedure of implementing these controls. Therefore, based on the provided context, it's safe to say that the statement is incorrect. Detroit is not hesitant about enacting pollution controls but is, instead, actively ready to do so.

If \\"A smiling man in a dark shirt is playing on a' Guitar Hero' controller.\\", can we conclude \\"The man is smiling.\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the given statement, \\"A smiling man in a dark shirt is playing on a 'Guitar Hero' controller,\\" we can indeed conclude that \\"The man is smiling.\\" The statement provides us with three distinct pieces of information: 1. The man is smiling. 2. The man is wearing a dark shirt. 3. The man is playing on a Guitar Hero controller. To break down the sentence, let us analyze each component. \\"The man\\": This is the primary subject of the statement. All additional descriptors in the sentence pertain to the man. \\"A smiling man\\": The word \\"smiling\\" is an adjective and suggests that the primary attribute of the man in the statement is that he is expressing happiness through a smile. From this part of the sentence alone, we can already determine that the man is smiling. \\"In a dark shirt\\": This part of the sentence illustrates that the man is wearing a specific color of shirt, dark. While this descriptor helps paint a more vivid image, it does not impact the information about the man smiling. \\"Is playing on a 'Guitar Hero' controller\\": The final portion of the statement explains what the man is doing, specifically that he is using a Guitar Hero controller. This tells us about the man's activity during the time in which he is smiling. However, like the earlier shirt color detail, this does not have any effect on whether or not he is smiling. When piecing these elements together, the initial information about the smiling man is not contradicted anywhere else in the statement. Therefore, given the statement, \\"A smiling man in a dark shirt is playing on a 'Guitar Hero' controller,\\" we can confidently conclude that \\"The man is smiling.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: go to work B: needed to pick up the papers for their paper route C: needed to learn to ride a bike Answer:","completion":"Answer: B: needed to pick up the papers for their paper route According to the context provided, Kendall was riding their bicycle on the street at 7 AM on Monday morning. While we don't have explicit information about Kendall's motivations or actions, we can analyze each of the options given and determine the best answer based on the context. Option A: go to work While it is possible that Kendall was riding their bicycle to work, the context does not provide any information connecting Kendall's early morning bike ride to a job or workplace. Without any reference to work in the context, it is difficult to conclude that this is the best answer. Option B: needed to pick up the papers for their paper route This option is a plausible explanation for Kendall's actions at 7 AM on Monday morning. Historically, paper routes have been a popular task for early risers, and paper deliveries typically occur in the early hours of the morning in order to reach recipients before they start their day. Given the context of Kendall riding their bicycle at this early hour on a weekday, it is likely that they were picking up papers for their paper route before making deliveries to customers. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that no other contextual information contradicts or conflicts with this possibility. Option C: needed to learn to ride a bike The context does not imply that Kendall needed to learn how to ride a bike, as they were already riding on the street at 7 AM. Furthermore, learning to ride a bike at that early hour on a Monday does not seem like a likely explanation for their actions. Based on the analysis of the given context and answer options, the best answer according to the context is option B: needed to pick up the papers for their paper route. This explanation takes into account the early morning timing and weekday occurrence, as well as the typical schedule and requirements of a person with a paper route. Additionally, it does not introduce any conflicting information or assumptions that would make it less likely to be true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
