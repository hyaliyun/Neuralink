Revolving around the fictional character and family of New Jersey-based Italian American mobster Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), the show portrays the difficulties he faces as he tries to balance the conflicting requirements of his home life and his criminal organization. These are often highlighted during his therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco).

On a television program, for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in dramas than in comedies, especially in soap operas. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format. Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics, as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on.

(Associated Press) The border collie inspired a traffic scare and social media gold after he plunged down a hill and onto a highway in his master's vehicle. Wednesday's incident near Abington, Scotland, began when farmer Tom Hamilton left Don sitting in his utility vehicle as he inspected lambs. He insists the parking brake was on. Not strongly enough. The vehicle rolled through a fence, down a steep hill and across the M74 motorway, missing other vehicles and hitting a security barrier. Onlookers presumed the dog was driving, and that inspired an online joke-fest. Some wondered if police had collared Don and put him in the doghouse, whether he was licensed to drive, or might have been barking mad. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A dog named Don accidentally drove a small tractor onto a highway in Scotland.

The incorrect answer should not be trivial, in the sense that they should not be easily eliminated without reading the paragraph. Q: Paragraph- Sent 1: The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. Sent 2: The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. Sent 3: One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. Sent 4: On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Sent 5: This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. Sent 6: But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. Sent 7: In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Sent 8: Here, OFAC had more success. Sent 9: It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Sent 10: Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. Sent 11: After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Sent 12: Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Sent 13: Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Sent 14: Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Sent 15: Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. Sent 16: This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. Sent 17: As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Sent 18: Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.

The film flashes back to the morning of June 6, 1944, the beginning of the Normandy Invasion, as American soldiers prepare to land on Omaha Beach. They suffer heavily from their struggle against German infantry, machine gun nests, and artillery fire. Captain John H. Miller, a company commander of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, survives the initial landing and assembles a group of his Rangers to penetrate the German defenses, leading to a breakout from the beach. After the battle, the body of a dead soldier lying face down on the beach, with \\"S. Ryan\\" inscribed on the back of his uniform, is shown. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C, at the U.S. War Department, General George Marshall is informed that three of the four brothers of the Ryan family were killed in action and that their mother is to receive all three telegrams in the same day. He learns that the fourth son, Private First Class James Francis Ryan, is a paratrooper and is missing in action somewhere in Normandy. Marshall, after reading Abraham Lincoln's Bixby letter, orders that Ryan must be found and sent home immediately.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Where is Camp Humphreys located?

When Daniel is abducted by Pinochet's secret police DINA, Lena tries to find and save her boyfriend. She tracks him to a sealed-off organization called \\"Colonia Dignidad\\", which presents itself as a charitable mission run by a lay preacher, Paul Schäfer. Lena joins the organization to rescue her boyfriend, only to learn it is a cult from which no one has ever escaped. She later finds Daniel, who acts disabled to be overlooked. Daniel discovers the organization is also an illegal operations center for DINA. Lena and Daniel attempt to escape from Colonia Dignidad along with Ursel, a pregnant nurse.

The family of ISIS hostage and U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig released a YouTube video Saturday asking his captors to show mercy and free him.

Despite the adversity they faced, their spirits could not be broken. This resilience left a profound impact on Peter, as he continued to extend his help to those affected by the war. In an unexpected turn of events, Peter's captors began to see the humanity in him, as they remembered friends and family who had suffered the same pain and loss at the hands of war. They couldn't ignore the positive influence Peter had on the very people they were fighting to protect. A discussion went on amongst Peter's captors, as they weighed the potential consequences of releasing him. A contentious debate took place, with some fearing the repercussions from their higher-ups, while others argued that sparing Peter's life would send a message of peace and hope. Eventually, they came to a decision – they would let him go. Against all odds, Peter was released. By showing compassion, the captors demonstrated unity, hospitality and mercy - something all had thought was unimaginable. They had been touched by the genuine compassion Peter had shown Syrians, and his selflessness in providing aid and comfort during their time of need. Peter's return was a heartening sight for his devastated family, who had made countless appeals to secure his release. It served as a beacon of hope for others in similar predicaments and those still advocating for peace. The Kassig family continued their humanitarian work, focusing their efforts on helping the people in the Middle East, constantly inspired by the resilience they had witnessed in those they sought to help. Peter shared his story and experience, highlighting the importance of not allowing the actions of few to represent the collective beliefs and actions of a nation or its people. In this moment, two vastly different worlds were able to find a common ground. It signified that even in the midst of war and chaos, love and compassion could prevail. The world would learn a valuable lesson from Peter's ordeal and the actions of his captors that eventually set him free: the transformative power of mercy and empathy. This story ends on a hopeful note, with the message that even in the darkest of times, human connections can cut across boundaries, ultimately prevailing over hatred, terror, and violence."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer:","completion":"Himalayacalamus and Pterocarya are two distinct genera of plants that belong to different plant families. Himalayacalamus is a genus of bamboo plants that primarily grow in the Himalayan regions, while Pterocarya is a genus of walnut trees found throughout Asia and Europe. To combine the facts and answer the question, let's explore the natural habitats of both these plant genera individually and identify the areas where their distributions overlap. Himalayacalamus, a type of mountain bamboo, belongs to the Poaceae family and is native to the eastern part of the Himalayas. This region spans across several countries, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet (Autonomous Region of China). These bamboos are typically found in high-altitude forests, growing at elevations of up to 3600 meters in moist environments. They thrive in shady and cool environments and can be seen in diverse ecosystems, such as alpine meadows, montane forests, and along streambanks. On the other hand, Pterocarya, a genus of the Juglandaceae family, consists of deciduous trees commonly known as wingnuts. They are native to Asia and Europe, with their distribution ranging from eastern, central, and western Asia, reaching as far as the southeastern parts of Europe. These trees grow in river valleys, floodplains, wetlands, and other riparian habitats. One prominent species of Pterocarya, Pterocarya stenoptera or the Chinese wingnut, is a widely cultivated ornamental tree species native to eastern and central China. Considering the natural habitats of both Himalayacalamus and Pterocarya, it is possible to find both of these genera in some regions of China, specifically in the provinces adjoining the Himalayas and nearby low-lying areas, where the habitats of these plant genera overlap. Both bamboos and wingnut trees can be found in temperate forest ecosystems and riparian zones of this region, where the environmental conditions like temperature, elevation, and moisture content support the growth of both Himalayacalamus and Pterocarya. In conclusion, both Himalayacalamus and Pterocarya can be found in certain areas of the Himalayan regions in China, where their geographical distributions intersect. It is in these overlapping regions where one can witness the unique combination of these mountain bamboos and walnut trees, showcasing the remarkable diversity of plant life in this part of the world."},{"prompt":"Valea Scurtă River (Criș) - The Valea Scurtă River is a tributary of the Crişul Repede River in Romania Given a choice of categories company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, the text refers to which one?

You will need to create a free account before you can ship the cigarettes. A few cities now offer recycling programs of their own. Check with your local government and trash disposal service to see if this is an option. First, get a cardboard box from an office supply store or ground shipping company. Fold and tape the bottom end to prepare the box. Once the filters are loaded into a durable plastic bag or container, tie the bag shut and set it in the box. Make sure the bag is tied tightly. If it is wet or leaking, the shipping company may reject it.. Fold the box’s flaps shut, making sure the bag fits firmly inside the box. When you’re done, tape all the way around each fold. Pick up the box to make sure the top and bottom hold tight and won’t open in transit. You have to get a shipping label from the website you signed up for earlier. Return to the website and indicate that you have a package to ship. They will email you a pre-paid label. Print the label, place it on the box, and tape it down. You will need to get a unique label from the recycling service for each shipment. The label usually goes on top of the box. Consult the shipping company’s rules to clear up any confusion. Take the box to a shipping center or call the shipping company to come retrieve the box. The recycling company will tell you what shipper to contact, which can be seen on their website and on the shipping label. Follow the recycling company’s instructions in order to avoid shipping costs. For example, TerraCycle will have you call 1-800-PICK-UPS and tell UPS you have a package with a prepaid return shipping label.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Kashmiri Pandits (also known as Kashmiri Brahmins) are a Brahmin community from the Kashmir Valley, a mountainous region in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. They are the only remaining Hindu community native to the Kashmir Valley. - Kashmir is the northernmost geographical region of the Indian subcontinent. Until the mid-19th century, the term \\"Kashmir\\" denoted only the valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal mountain range. Today, it denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir (subdivided into Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh divisions), the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract. - Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit (18 August 1900 1 December 1990) was an Indian diplomat and politician, the sister of Jawaharlal Nehru, the aunt of Indira Gandhi and the grand-aunt of Rajiv Gandhi, each of whom served as Prime Minister of India. Pandit was sent to London, as India's most important diplomat, after serving as Nehrus envoy to the Soviet Union, the USA and the United Nations. Her time in London offers insights into the wider context of changes in IndoBritish relations. Her High-Commissionership was a microcosm of inter-governmental relations. - Rajiv Ratna Gandhi (20 August 1944 21 May 1991) was the Prime Minister of India, serving from 1984 to 1989. He took office after the 1984 assassination of his mother, Prime Minister Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi, to become the youngest Indian Prime Minister at the age of 40. - The Prime Minister of India (Hindi: , \\"Bhrat k Pradhnamantr\\") is the Head of Government and leader of the executive branch of the Government of India. The Prime Minister is also the chief adviser to the President of India and head of the Council of Ministers. He or she can be a member of any of the two houses of Parliament (the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha), but has to be the leader of the political party, having a majority in the Lok Sabha. - Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 30 January 1948) was the preeminent leader of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahatma (Sanskrit: \\"high-souled\\", \\"venerable\\")applied to him first in 1914 in South Africais now used worldwide. In India, he is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for \\"father\\", \\"papa\\") and Gandhiji. He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation. - Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi (Nehru; 19 November 1917 31 October 1984) was an Indian politician and central figure of the Indian National Congress party, and to date the only female Prime Minister of India. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. She served as Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984, making her the second-longest-serving Prime Minister of India after her father. Gandhi served as her father's personal assistant and hostess during his tenure as prime minister between 1947 and 1964. She was elected Congress President in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964, Gandhi refused to enter the Congress party leadership contest and instead chose to become a cabinet minister in the government led by Lal Bahadur Shastri. In the Congress Party's parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966, upon the death of Shastri, she defeated her rival, Morarji Desai, to become leader, and thus succeeded Shastri as Prime Minister of India. - Jawaharlal Nehru (14 November 1889 27 May 1964) was the first Prime Minister of India and a central figure in Indian politics before and after independence. He emerged as the paramount leader of the Indian independence movement under the tutelage of Mahatma Gandhi and ruled India from its establishment as an independent nation in 1947 until his death in 1964. He is considered to be the architect of the modern Indian nation-state: a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. He was also known as Pandit Nehru due to his roots with the Kashmiri Pandit community while many Indian children knew him as \\"Uncle Nehru\\" (\\"Chacha\\" Nehru). - The Indian independence movement encompassed activities and ideas aiming to end the East India Company rule (17571858) and the British Indian Empire (18581947) in the Indian subcontinent. The movement spanned a total of 190 years (1757-1947). - Krishna Nehru Hutheesing ( 1907 -- 1967 ) was an Indian writer , the youngest sister of Jawaharlal Nehru and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit , and part of the Nehru - Gandhi family . What is the relationship between 'krishna hutheesing' and 'london'? Answer:","completion":"Krishna Hutheesing, born as Krishna Nehru, was the youngest sister of Jawaharlal Nehru and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, both key figures in the Indian independence movement and Indian politics. While there is no direct relationship between Krishna Hutheesing and London, her family connections and her status as a part of the influential Nehru-Gandhi family provide indirect links. Her sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, served as India's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in London from 1954 to 1961. During this time, she played a critical role in solidifying Indo-British diplomatic relations in the years following India's independence. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit's tenure as High Commissioner to the UK would likely have connected Krishna Hutheesing to London through her sister's diplomatic activities and involvement in the Indian diaspora community in the United Kingdom. Moreover, the broader Nehru-Gandhi family, including Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, and Rajiv Gandhi, each served as Prime Minister of India at different points in time, engaging in international diplomacy and state visits, some of which likely involved trips to London for high-level talks and diplomatic engagements. As a writer, Krishna Hutheesing also traveled to various countries and interacted with international intellectuals and political figures. While it is unclear whether her travels brought her specifically to London, the possibility remains given her family's deep involvement in Indian politics and diplomacy and their frequent interactions with the United Kingdom and other global powers. To summarize, although there is no direct relationship between Krishna Hutheesing and London, her connection to the influential Nehru-Gandhi family, especially her sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit's role as India's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, establishes an indirect link between Hutheesing and the British capital."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a beautiful place that I would highly recommend. I told my family that I was going to go find a port-a-pot. So I head off by myself. I’m in the port-a-pot, i’m in there for roughly 10 minutes. (you can assume what I was doing) I wash my hands and get ready to leave the port-a-pot, and I tried to open the door and it was locked. I’m claustrophobic, so I start to FREAK OUT. I started banging on the door, running into the door with all of my weight. Nothing was helping. I then start crying, I thought for sure that I was going to die. I knew it was the end, at the age of 14, locked in a port-a-pot, in 95 degree weather in the middle of a beach in Georgia. Looking back, i’m curious as to why my family never came to look for me, I was gone for like 30 minutes. So I’m banging on the door continuously, bawling my eyes out. Then a man opened the door for me, from the outside. He was about 6’3 with dreads about 12 inches long and weighed about 280 pounds. I ran out of the port-a-pot and jumped on the guy and gave him a hug and told him that I loved him and that he saved my life. I don’t know how he managed to open the door for me, but I definitely know that my 14 year old self owes that man my life. I’m not sure where he is in life, or what he’s doing, but I hope God is blessing him abundantly. It is definitely a funny story to tell my friends. After the author found her parents, they were probably: - Happy to see her back after 30 minutes - Angry at her for taking so long - Confused about why she was with the man in dreads - not enough information","completion":"Your story of getting locked in a port-a-pot at Tybee Island, Georgia, during a family vacation is certainly an unforgettable experience. Being in that confined space for around 30 minutes and fearing for your life must have been extremely distressing, especially since you are claustrophobic. It is natural that you felt a surge of relief and gratitude when the tall man with dreads managed to unlock the door and set you free. It's interesting to think about how your family must have felt during that time, not knowing exactly where you were or why it was taking so long. When you finally found them and returned, they were likely experiencing a mix of emotions. They may have been happy and relieved to have you back after being gone for half an hour, but at the same time, also slightly angry or irritated due to the unexpected long wait. They could have been understandably confused about why you were with the man in dreads, considering they had no knowledge of the situation you were in. It's possible that they were initially concerned about your safety and may have been protective when they noticed you with a stranger. Alternatively, they might have been surprised or even amused to see you clinging to this person, carrying a story they couldn't have anticipated. Regardless of their reactions, your experience was a unique one that demonstrates the importance of staying calm and composed in challenging situations. It also serves as a vivid reminder that unexpected help can and does appear in various forms when we need it the most. You realized the value of kindness and how it affected your life, and in turn, learned to appreciate and cherish the random acts of kindness from strangers. While you're unsure of the man's current situation, his actions will always have a lasting impact on your life. This story remains a valuable lesson about overcoming fear, accepting help from others, and appreciating the valuable life-saving opportunities provided by strangers. Moreover, it's a heartwarming and humorous tale you can share with your friends and family, making them reflect on the unpredictability of life and appreciate the kindness of others."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Last year, I rented a small house on Vega IV, a sea world, all islands and reefs and archipelagos, turquoise waters and aquamarine skies, sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernova. There's only one city: called Nuevo Acapulco in La Enciclopedia del Empirio de la Humanidad, it's N'apulco to the locals. The N'apulcans are mostly emigrants from Polaris II; the only difference between them and their Carribbean ancestors is that the ancestors fleeced NorAm tourists.

I suppose I wish to show that I'm still capable of a certain authorial distance, a semblance of dispassionate observation. The following events may indicate otherwise. In fine tourist tradition, most homes on Vega IV are named. Mine was The Sleeping Flamingo, and its outer walls were coral pink. Were they mood-sensitive, they would have changed as I first viewed them. The rental agent, an attractive N'apulcan named Tasha Cortez, was not mood-sensitive either. She said, \\"It's beautiful, isn't it, Señor Flynn?\\" My instinct was to gesture curtly with a cupped hand that she lift the wind boat and take me elsewhere. But she was young and attractive (as I have said and may say again) and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous Bernardo Flynn that I merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism.

Article: The average British 22 year-old has more than 1,000 online friends on sites like Facebook, compared to those in their fifties who have fewer than 20, according to a new study. The \\"Facebookgeneration gap\\" has been highlighted in a new piece of research which shows that the average 22 year-old claims to have 1,000 or more friends on sites like Facebook. People in their twenties have more than 50 times as many digital friends as those who are over 50 years old, despite the popularity of sites like Facebook with the older generations, says a study conducted by consumer research group Intersperience. The news comes during the same week Facebook's second-in command, Sheryl Sandberg, is visiting the UK to deliver a speech at the London School of Economics. Facebook's chief operating officer is going to speak about how the social web has transformed people's friendships and relationships. The survey found that there was a clear link between people's age and the number of online friends they have.The researchers found that those aged 13 to 16, have an average of 450 friends on social networks, with girls having slightly more friends that boys.People in their thirties tend to have between 100 and 200 friends, while those in their forties have between 50 and 100. However, those using sites such as Facebook over the age of 50, tended to have 20 or less friends.The oldest person surveyed was 70 years old. Paul Hudson, Intersperience's chief executive, said: \\"Our research underlines fundamental changes taking place in British society as a result of finally entering the digital age.Half of the UK population are on Facebook now.In a social media context, a 'friend' means something different to a 20 year old than to a 50 year old.\\" He added: \\"Social networking activity is just one example of how different groups are adapting to the digital age at different paces.In this case, age is the determining factor - however in other instances it is not.\\" Question: What's the main idea of the passage?

Movie title: Clash of the Titans Movie plot: In ancient times, after defeating their predecessors, the Titans, the gods divided the Universe among themselves. Zeus took the skies, Poseidon took the seas, and Hades was left with the Underworld upon being tricked by Zeus. The gods created the mortals, whose faith and prayers fueled the gods' immortality. As time passed, however, mortals began to question and soon resist their creators, angering the Olympians. A fisherman named Spyros finds a coffin adrift in the sea, discovering a baby, Perseus and his mother DanaÃ«. Spyros and his wife, Marmara, raise Perseus as their own son, alongside their daughter, Tekla. One day, an adult Perseus and his family watch soldiers from the city of Argos destroying the statue of Zeus. Infuriated at this, the Gods unleash the Furies who attack the soldiers and destroy the family's fishing vessel. Only Perseus survives and is found by a group of the soldiers. Perseus is brought before King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia, who are celebrating their campaign against the gods. Queen Cassiopeia compares her daughter Andromeda to the gods and boasts that she is more beautiful than Aphrodite. The revelry is cut short by the arrival of Hades, who has been given leave by Zeus to punish the mortals for their defiance. Hades threatens to unleash his monster, the Kraken, against Argos, unless Andromeda is offered as a sacrifice. Before leaving, he reveals that Perseus is a demigod and the son of Zeus. Perseus meets Io, who confirms his origin. According to Io, a king of Argos named Acrisius defied the Gods and laid siege on Olympus. Zeus wanted to teach him a lesson, but he could not kill the humans because he loved them so much. Instead, he decided to make an example out of Calibos and disguised himself as the king, and then made love to his wife. When Calibos realized this, he executed his wife and son, while cursing Zeus and denying him their bodies. Zeus punishes him further by deforming him. Though Queen Danae dies, her son, who turns out to be Perseus, survives. Perseus leads the... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Clash of the Titans,\\" it is Perseus, the demigod son of Zeus and Danaë, who kills Medusa. Perseus, after learning about his true lineage and the threat of the Kraken that looms over Argos, takes on the dangerous task of defeating the monster. To do this, he must first kill Medusa and use her severed head to turn the Kraken to stone. Perseus, alongside a team of warriors from Argos and guided by Io, embarks on a perilous journey to seek out the Gorgon Medusa, whose gaze has the power to turn anyone who looks at her directly into stone. Medusa is one of the three Gorgon sisters, but unlike the other two, she is mortal and can be killed. She resides in the Underworld, making it a treacherous quest that tests the skills and bravery of Perseus and his comrades. Upon arriving at the lair of Medusa, the team faces various obstacles and dangers. They must navigate through the treacherous environment while avoiding the deadly gaze of the Gorgon. Although some members of the team fall victim to Medusa's power, Perseus manages to develop a strategy to confront her. Using his wits, sharp reflexes, and the assistance of a reflective shield gifted by the gods, Perseus is able to look at Medusa's reflection in the shield without turning to stone. This allows him to approach her safely and engage her in combat. After a fierce and intense battle, Perseus manages to decapitate Medusa while avoiding her petrifying stare. With Medusa's severed head in hand, Perseus returns to Argos to face the Kraken. As the massive creature emerges from the sea and prepares to destroy the city, Perseus presents the head of Medusa to the monster. The Kraken gazes upon Medusa's lifeless, yet still potent, eyes and is instantly turned to stone, saving the city of Argos from destruction. In conclusion, Perseus, the demigod son of Zeus and protagonist of the movie, is the one who ultimately defeats and kills Medusa in \\"Clash of the Titans.\\" This act sets the stage for the eventual defeat of the Kraken and illustrates the power of resilience in humanity's struggle against seemingly insurmountable obstacles."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I remember having glow in the dark stars on my ceiling as a kid so I figured I'd get these for my nephew.

We arrived around 530 and the place wasn't packed but there were already a number of diners seated. The restaurant is much larger than expected and I enjoyed the ambiance quite a bit. It's on the darker side and makes you feel like you're the only people in the place. We were seated quickly and perused the menu.

The human hand is a complex and versatile structure made up of numerous parts that work together to perform a wide range of functions. These parts can be divided into different categories: bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels. Here is an overview of the main parts: 1. Bones: There are 27 bones in each hand, which can be divided into three main groups: the carpal bones (in the wrist), the metacarpal bones (in the palm), and the phalanges (in the fingers). Each finger has three phalanges, while the thumb has only two. 2. Joints: The joints in the hand are the points where the bones meet and allow for movement. They include the wrist joint, the metacarpophalangeal joints (connecting the fingers to the palm), the proximal interphalangeal joints (connecting the first and second sections of the fingers), and the distal interphalangeal joints (connecting the second and third sections of the fingers). 3. Muscles: Hand muscles are divided into extrinsic muscles (located in the forearm and responsible for the finger and wrist movement) and intrinsic muscles (located within the hand and responsible for the fine motor skills of the fingers). 4. Tendons: Tendons are strong, fibrous cords that connect the muscles to the bones, allowing for the movement of the hand. 5. Ligaments: Ligaments are tough, flexible bands of tissue that connect the bones of the hand and maintain stability of the joints. 6. Nerves: The three main nerves of the hand are the radial, median, and ulnar nerves, responsible for transmitting signals between the brain and the hand, allowing for movement, sensation, and touch. 7. Blood vessels: The hand has an extensive network of blood vessels, including arteries and veins, that provide oxygen and nutrients to the tissues as well as remove waste products. To further elaborate on the fingertips, which are an essential part of the hand, they consist of the distal phalanges (the third bone segment in each finger), the nails, and the skin. Fingertips have highly sensitive skin, which enables them to be the primary source of our sense of touch. The dense concentration of nerve endings in the fingertips allows for precise tactile feedback and impressive positioning capabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: I normally want neighbours to resolve conflict among ourselves. The history My neighbour downstairs bangs on my floor aka his ceiling once or twice a month presumably because I’m making too much noise. My neighbour also smokes cigarettes. It’s unclear whether he’s allowed to, I choose to give him the benefit of the doubt as it’s possible he was grandfathered in before the no smoking policy. Whenever I smell smoke wafting up into my suite I simply close my patio door or bedroom window and it prevents stinking up my suite. The incident I was assembling IKEA furniture at 5PM. I hear a ton of banging on the floor. I adjust to work more quietly and finish entirely within 20 minutes. The fallout The next day I come home to a mild smell of cigarette smoke in the entrance to my apartment. I see an envelope on the floor under my doors mail slot, and when I pick it up it reeks of cigarette smoke. I open it and read a strongly word letter from the tenant downstairs, complaining of loud banging at 5PM the day before, threatening to contact the tenancy board and pursue further action of this nature. I put the letter in a zip lock to contain the smell. My apartment smells nice and my air freshener doesn’t need competition. My take This dude is over sensitive to noise, irritable in general and gross. I wait on it a few days and think on how to respond. I decided: - I really don’t want to interact with this person. It will be very very unpleasant between the predictable stink and the likelihood of a unpleasant exchange. - instead, after a week, I wrote a note to the landlord saying I normally ignore the eccentric irritability of the person downstairs but now that they are leaving stinky letters in my entrance I have to address it. - I included the stinky letter in the ziplock bag for the landlord to read and presumably smell. - I told the landlord I will be ignoring this tenant going forward as best I can. I also mentioned that my neighbour to my right has never complained of noise and even told me he likes living next to me because I’m not loud or obnoxious and as a bonus I’m not a smoker. - my call to action with the landlord was that he simply ask the tenant downstairs to be more tolerant of noise during daytime hours and to cease putting anything in my mail slot. Judge me Am I the asshole for: - avoiding the tenant downstairs entirely and just tattling to the landlord - avoiding conflict not because I’m afraid but because I just genuinely think the tenant downstairs is stinky and passive aggressive and his letter gave me all the insight I needed on both.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. and the situation: Two groups of scientists examined two fires. Group A put a large log on it, and group B made a fire with small twigs. They wanted to see which fire would last longer. Answer the following question: Which group had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Group B, which used small twigs, had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction. The key factor influencing the intensity of the reaction in this scenario is the surface area of the wood being burned. As explained in the background information, an increase in the surface area of a reactant results in an increased rate of reaction. When the same mass of wood is present in the form of smaller particles, such as the twigs used by Group B, the surface area is significantly larger compared to a single large log used by Group A. The larger surface area of the twigs allows for greater contact with oxygen, which is necessary for combustion to occur. As a result, the combustion process is accelerated, leading to a more intense reaction in the fire created by Group B. This means that the fire would burn hotter and more vigorously, but also more quickly, when compared to the fire created with a large log by Group A. In contrast, the large log used by Group A has a lower surface area, which limits the contact between the wood and oxygen. Thus, the combustion process is slower, and the fire will burn less intensely. However, this also means that the fire would last longer due to the slower consumption of the available fuel. In conclusion, Group B's fire, which was created with small twigs, provoked a more intense reaction compared to the fire built with a large log by Group A. This is because the increased surface area of the twigs enabled a faster and more vigorous combustion process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Next question: where does most digestion in the small intestine take place?","completion":"To answer the question, I will consider the three main parts of the small intestine and determine where the majority of the digestion takes place. Step 1: Identify the main parts of the small intestine The small intestine consists of three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Step 2: Analyze the role of duodenum in digestion The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine. In the duodenum, chyme (partially digested food) from the stomach mixes with digestive enzymes and bile. The enzymes come from the pancreas, and the bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder before being released into the duodenum. In this section, most of the chemical digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats occurs. Step 3: Analyze the role of jejunum in digestion The jejunum is the middle part of the small intestine. The primary function of the jejunum is to continue the digestion process that began in the duodenum and to absorb nutrients. Many enzymes from the brush border (microvilli) of the jejunum's lining further break down the food particles. The nutrients are then absorbed into the bloodstream through the jejunum's lining. Step 4: Analyze the role of ileum in digestion The ileum is the last part of the small intestine. While some digestion may still occur in the ileum, its primary function is to absorb nutrients, such as vitamin B12, bile salts, and any remaining nutrients not absorbed earlier. Step 5: Determine where most digestion occurs in the small intestine Based on the analysis, the majority of digestion takes place in the duodenum, where many enzymes and bile break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said wants to hit better-off homeowners with the mansion tax in the next financial year. Labour has asked the Treasury to start drawing up plans to levy its mansion tax on 100,000 expensive homes from day one of regaining power. Despite a revolt from some Labour MPs over the annual levy, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said he aimed to hit better-off homeowners in the next financial year. Although it is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year, Mr Balls said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough it into the NHS as quickly as possible. He said Treasury officials were already working on the proposals, in line with the civil service practice of making plans to implement the policies of parties that could win a forthcoming election. Labour and Liberal Democrat plans for a mansion tax had been in doubt after George Osborne’s dramatic reform of stamp duty at the Autumn Statement, which have made buying a home worth £1million or more far more expensive. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party would stick with its policy of an annual levy – but suggested it may have to be amended following the Chancellor’s changes. Labour opponents of the party’s own mansion tax scheme have also stepped up their campaign to persuade Mr Balls to shift his position. But the Shadow Chancellor insisted in an interview with the Independent: ‘Saving the NHS will be at the heart of our first Budget. I would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a Labour government, before the end of the financial year. We will have to see the practicalities.’ Mr Balls denied charges could be imposed retrospectively. ‘A charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year. No one will have any doubt about our intentions,’ he insisted. The Coalition has sought to undermine Mr Balls’s pledge to raise £2.5billion for the NHS through a combination of the mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds by announcing its own £3billion boost. Critics also pointed out that revenues from these measures were unlikely to start flowing in until the middle of the next Parliament. However, Mr Balls said Labour could legislate for the mansion tax to start in the following financial year of 2016-17 ‘as a backstop’. Labour’s mansion tax will be about £3,000 a year for homes in the £2million to £3million bracket. Experts say an average charge of £11,000 a year will need to be levied to raise the £1.2billion a year Labour predicts. The Conservatives claim it will be extended to cover cheaper properties.

Background: Anggun Cipta Sasmi (Indonesian pronunciation: [aNG'gun 'tSipta 'sasmi]; born 29 April 1974) is an Indonesian and French-naturalised singer-songwriter. Born in Jakarta, she began performing at the age of seven and recorded a children's album two years later. With the help of famed Indonesian producer Ian Antono, in 1986 Anggun released her first rock-influenced studio album, Dunia Aku Punya. Context: Anggun was born and raised in Jakarta to a native Indonesian family. She is the second child and first daughter of Darto Singo, a Javanese writer, and Dien Herdina, a housewife from the Yogyakartan royal family. Her full name means \\"grace born of a dream\\" in Balinese. Despite being a Muslim, Anggun was sent to a Catholic school to receive a better elementary education. At the age of seven, Anggun began receiving highly disciplined instruction in singing from her father. She trained daily, learning various vocal techniques. To help further develop her career, her mother began serving as her manager, accepting singing offers and handling business concerns. At the age of nine, Anggun began to write her own songs and recorded her first children's album. As a preteen, Anggun was influenced by Western rock music artists. At the age of twelve, she released her first official studio album, Dunia Aku Punya (1986). The album was produced by Ian Antono, an Indonesian rock musician. However, the album failed to establish her popularity. Three years later, Anggun achieved some fame after the release of the single \\"Mimpi\\"; the song was later ranked by the Rolling Stone Indonesia magazine as one of the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time. Anggun's fame continued to increase with the release of subsequent singles, most notably \\"Tua Tua Keladi\\" (1990), which became her most popular hit in Indonesia. After a string of successful singles, Anggun released the studio albums Anak Putih Abu Abu (1991) and Nocturno (1992). The former earned her the Most Popular Indonesian Artist 1990-1991 award. In 1992, Anggun began a relationship with Michel de Gea, a French engineer, whom she had met the year before in Kalimantan while touring. The couple married, despite a rumoured objection by Anggun's family, reportedly because they felt Anggun was too young . Georgea later became Anggun's manager. The following year, Anggun became the youngest Indonesian singer to found her own record company, Bali Cipta Records, and took complete creative control over her work. She produced her final Indonesian studio album, Anggun C. Sasmi... Lah!!! (1993), which yielded the number-one single \\"Kembalilah Kasih (Kita Harus Bicara)\\". By age nineteen, Anggun had sold over four million albums in Indonesia. She began to feel dissatisfied with her success in her country and began considering an international music career. Anggun later recalled: \\"[By the time] I was 20, I'd made five albums. I'd built my own record company. I'd produced my last album and produced some Indonesian acts as well. And I said to myself: 'I'm tired! I cannot achieve more than I already have. There's no challenge anymore'.\\" Question: Did she have any siblings?.

The thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy, shaky, camera-work and the fast, confusing cutting. I am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their movies, but in this case there was WAY too much. It seems like the jump-cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. For a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development. That is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to watch an over the top action flick I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of Denzel Washington's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances. The first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichés are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens. So the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama/thriller , nor as a pure action movie. Of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years, but I absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool.

However, in this context, it is used to identify strong traits about Matze, so \\"strength\\" is the preferred translation. - ist: This straight up translates to \\"is\\" in English. - seine: This translates to \\"his\\". - Spontanität: This translates to \\"spontaneity\\". - und: This translates to \\"and\\". - sein: This also translates to \\"his\\". - Wortwitz: Wortwitz can be directly translated as \\"word wit\\" but in English, it's more accurately translated as \\"wit\\" or \\"wordplay\\".

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The given data provides information about a dish named Bacon Explosion, which appears to be a culinary creation that revolves around the use of bacon and sausage primarily. In this description, we will delve into the components of the dish, potential methods of preparation, and the significance of the ingredients mentioned. First, let's discuss the two main ingredients that are mentioned in the data: bacon and sausage. Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork, which is typically prepared from various cuts of meat, predominantly from the pork belly or back cuts. It has a rich, savory, and slightly smoky flavor profile that makes it a popular food item, particularly in American and European cuisines. Sausage, on the other hand, is a meat product made from ground or minced meat, typically seasoned with various spices and flavorings, and stuffed into a casing that is usually made of animal intestines or synthetic materials. Sausages can be made from a wide variety of meats, such as pork, beef, or chicken, and come in numerous flavors and styles, depending on the spices used and the cooking methods applied. Given that both bacon and sausage are the main ingredients in the Bacon Explosion dish, it is evident that this dish is a celebration of meaty flavors and an indulgent creation designed to cater to those who enjoy dishes with intense, savory flavors. This combination of ingredients suggests that the Bacon Explosion could be a hearty, protein-rich dish perfect for serving at gatherings or special occasions, particularly to those who appreciate bacon and sausage as staple food items. While we do not have a detailed recipe for the Bacon Explosion in the provided data, we can make some educated guesses based on the core ingredients and the name of the dish. The term \\"explosion\\" implies that this dish could be a larger-than-life presentation, possibly featuring generous amounts of bacon and sausage combined and cooked together in a visually appealing and appetizing manner. One potential method of preparation could involve weaving the bacon slices together to form a lattice-like structure, which would then be used to wrap around a filling made from the seasoned sausage meat, adding extra flavor and moisture to the final dish. To create a highly flavorful and enjoyable eating experience, additional ingredients might be incorporated into the Bacon Explosion. For example, a mixture of BBQ sauce, spices, and brown sugar could be utilized as a glaze or marinade to add sweetness, tanginess, and depth of flavor to the dish. Furthermore, finely chopped onions, garlic, and other herbs could be added to the sausage filling, enhancing the overall savory profile of the dish while providing an aromatic element that balances the richness of the bacon and sausage. In conclusion, the Bacon Explosion is a meat-centric dish that celebrates the combination of bacon and sausage, creating a hearty, indulgent, and flavorful meal option. Although the specific recipe and preparation methods are not given in the data, the name of the dish and the core ingredients suggest that this culinary creation is designed to provide an unforgettable, rich, and savory taste experience for bacon and sausage enthusiasts. With the potential addition of supplementary ingredients and seasonings, the Bacon Explosion could be an eye-catching and satisfying addition to any table that appreciates meaty flavors and impressive presentations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the answer you found does not provide the correct information regarding when the Titanic sank. The Titanic, a British passenger liner, sank on April 15, 1912, after it struck an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City. The collision occurred on the night of April 14, and the ship sank approximately two hours and forty minutes later, in the early hours of April 15. The wreck of the Titanic does lie on the seabed, split in two, at a depth of about 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) in the North Atlantic Ocean. The exact location is approximately 370 miles (600 kilometers) southeast of the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The wreckage is indeed gradually disintegrating due to factors such as ocean currents, corrosion, and the presence of microorganisms that consume the iron in the ship's structure. It is estimated that the wreck may completely vanish within the next few decades. In summary, while the information provided about the state of the wreck on the seabed is correct, it does not accurately answer when the Titanic sank.

Unfortunately, my experience was nothing short of a catastrophe, and I felt compelled to share my thoughts on this establishment. Upon arrival, the first thing that struck me was how chaotic the parking situation was. There were barely any spots available, and it seemed as if the management had not planned for the maximum occupancy they so often advertised. After circling the parking lot for nearly 20 minutes, I finally found a spot, but it was quite a distance from the entrance. This was not a great start to what was supposed to be a calming weekend getaway. As I walked towards the entrance, I noticed that the landscaping was poorly maintained. The grass overgrown in parts, and there were dead flowers in the planters. For a place that boasted its beautiful gardens, I was less than impressed. Once inside, the reception area was cramped and understaffed, with only one employee to attend to the line of unhappy guests. It took almost an hour to finally check in, and the employee's attitude left much to be desired. When I complained about the parking and wait time, she brushed off my concerns with an air of indifference. The room itself was just as disappointing. The linens appeared worn and had a musty odor, while the furnishings were dated and uncomfortable. Not to mention the noise--it was intolerable! Guests were congregating in the hallways, and the walls seemed paper-thin as I could hear every word from the room next door. The dining options on-site were underwhelming at best. The menu was limited and overpriced, while the quality of the food did not match the price points. I could forgive such a menu if the service was excellent, but that was not the case. The waitstaff seemed overworked, and their frustration showed through their interactions with diners. I had also been looking forward to treating myself to a pampering session at the on-site spa, but my experience there proved to be equally frustrating. There was a complete lack of communication between staff members, leading to confusion over my appointment. When I finally received my treatment, it did not live up to the decadent descriptions on their website. The massage felt rushed and uninspired, with the therapist barely exerting any pressure. Overall, my stay at \\"The Heavenly Retreat\\" was a nightmare of an experience, and I cannot recommend it to anyone seeking a peaceful and rejuvenating getaway. The poor customer service, disappointing accommodations, and subpar amenities left me feeling not just frustrated, but compelled to share my experience in hopes that others will think twice before wasting their time and money here."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The passage discusses an anecdotal situation that occurs in Italy, specifically in Rome, where a lot of people claim to be a \\"dottore\\" or doctor when called upon in a movie theater. The term \\"dottore\\" is commonly used to address anyone who has completed a university degree and not just those within the medical profession. This phenomenon is not limited to Rome; it is relatively widespread in Italy as a whole, where titles play a significant role in social interactions and conventions. This topic falls under the \\"World\\" category, as it concerns a cultural observation in a specific country (Italy). The passage is neither talking about sports, business, nor science/tech. Instead, it provides an insight into the social structure, traditions, and customs unique to Italy. It highlights the importance Italians place on educational achievements and the respect accorded to those with a degree. This observation can be further understood in the context of Italian society, where the \\"dottore\\" title is often used to describe lawyers, architects, and engineers, in addition to those within the medical profession. It is indicative of the weight Italian individuals place on professional achievements and qualifications, as well as the deference given to those who have obtained such accomplishments.

The answer is:","completion":"Xavier Saint-Just is renowned for his exquisite illustrations in a children's book written by Felix Salten. This book would eventually lay the groundwork for an influential 1942 animated film. To provide a comprehensive answer to this question, we need to explore who Felix Salten was, identify the book in question, as well as reveal the animated film's producer. Felix Salten was an Austrian author and critic best known for his work in children's literature. Born as Siegmund Salzmann in 1869, he went on to adopt Felix Salten as his pen name. With a successful career spanning several decades, Salten's most famous work, \\"Bambi, a Life in the Woods,\\" featured the tale of Bambi, a young deer that endures various life experiences, learning about love, loss, and survival. This novel was first published in 1923 and captured the hearts of readers worldwide. Xavier Saint-Just, the illustrator, brought life to the characters in Salten's \\"Bambi, a Life in the Woods\\" through his artistic expertise. His illustrative style captured the essence of Bambi's journey, allowing readers to engage more profoundly with the narrative. The synergy between Salten's storytelling and Xavier Saint-Just's illustrations contributed to the book's massive popularity, eventually garnering the interest of the entertainment industry. The prominent 1942 animated film adaptation of Felix Salten's \\"Bambi, a Life in the Woods\\" was produced by none other than Walt Disney. After discovering Salten's enchanting tale, Disney saw the story's potential and purchased the film rights in 1937.

Monro's assistant Charles Darwin arrives with a forged letter directing that all corpses thenceforth must be sent to Monro. Angus tells Knox's assistant, Patterson, the news. Patterson delivers the message to Knox. William Burke and William Hare, immigrants from Ulster, attempt to sell cheese mould as a patent medicine. When their fraud is discovered, they flee to an inn owned by Hare's wife, Lucky. She tells them that one of the lodgers has died. Burke and Hare decide to sell the corpse to Knox. They are forced to break the corpse's spine to fit it into a barrel in order to smuggle it through the city. They stop at a pub along the way, where a young former prostitute, Ginny Hawkins, loudly performs an excerpt from Macbeth. The patrons ignore her. Burke asks her why she did this, and she says that it is her ambition to become an actress. They share a drink; Hare reminds Burke that they must continue to Knox's house. Burke and Hare present the now-mangled corpse to Knox. After some negotiation, Knox agrees to pay them a good sum of money for each corpse they bring him for dissection. Burke plans to use his money to finance Ginny's theatrical ambitions, and Hare decides to open a funeral parlour. Returning to the inn, they find Lucky drunk and barely conscious. Lucky says she is drinking because Joseph, another lodger at the inn, is near death. Not willing to wait for the outcome, Burke and Hare suffocate Joseph and take the body to Knox. Afterward, Burke tells Ginny about the money. She allows him to take her home. Hare meets Fergus, the henchman of villain Danny McTavish, at a bar.

Q: At an early meeting of the British Sociological Association’s “Activism in Sociology Forum” members met to discuss how we might play a more campaigning role in the world outside the academy. Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda? I learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda? Because of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the “impact industry”; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study...

Replication is a technique widely employed in distributed computing systems, where multiple copies of the same data or application are duplicated on different servers or devices. It serves multiple purposes, such as increasing fault tolerance, improving availability, and enhancing performance. In modern multi-user environments, conflicting requirements and variations in user needs are inevitable, and replication can effectively address these issues. By having multiple copies distributed across various locations in the network, the system can efficiently manage conflicting requirements by directing user requests to the most appropriate replica. This way, each user can enjoy tailored services and personalized experiences based on their specific needs. Consequently, replication ensures an optimal balance between the demands of different users, resulting in improved overall system performance. When a user interacts with an application, they expect timely responses. This becomes challenging when there is a significant geographical distance between the user and the server hosting the application. By using replication, multiple copies of the application can be placed closer to the users, reducing the latency that results from the physical distance between them. This technique of replicating content, called edge computing or content distribution, ensures faster access to data and improved user experience. Furthermore, since each replica can bear some of the load, replication can efficiently distribute the workload among multiple servers. This approach, known as load balancing, prevents overloading any single server and ensures that the system can continue to function even during periods of increased demand, ensuring smooth performance for the end-users. In addition to reducing the workload, replication also helps with the availability of the data in case of server failure or maintenance. When a replica fails or goes offline, the requests can be automatically rerouted to the nearest available replica, ensuring minimal service disruption for the users. This increased redundancy and fault tolerance further contribute to the overall performance of the system. Considering all these factors—conflicting requirements, varying user needs, reduced latency, load balancing, and fault tolerance—it is evident that replication plays a crucial role in enhancing performance. It caters to specific needs, making the system more versatile while maintaining a high level of efficiency and reliability, ultimately ensuring a seamless experience for end-users."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington (CNN) -- The prospect of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell resigning as he copes with a federal investigation into the nearly 150,000 worth of lavish gifts the Republican and his family received from a wealthy executive is unlikely, people close to the governor insist. Yet the topic remains a tantalizing conversation piece around Richmond these days, mainly because it would be an act without modern precedent. While Virginia has had its fair share of tumultuous politics over the years, not since Reconstruction has the commonwealth been forced to grapple with a question of succession. No Virginia governor has resigned, or been impeached, in the last century. Here's the backstory: OPTIONS: - Bill Bolling has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. - Bob McDonnell has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. - Bolling has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. - CNN has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. - Cuccinelli has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. - Ken Cuccinelli has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. - Reconstruction has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. - Republican has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. - Richmond has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. - Virginia has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. - Washington has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor.","completion":"To determine the correct option, let's analyze each option separately: 1. Bill Bolling: He is a possible candidate, as he is part of Virginia politics. 2. Bob McDonnell: He is the current governor mentioned in the paragraph, so he cannot be the lieutenant governor. 3. Bolling: This refers to Bill Bolling, so it is a possible candidate. 4. CNN: This is a news network, not a person, so it cannot be the lieutenant governor. 5. Cuccinelli: This refers to Ken Cuccinelli, another politician, so he is a possible candidate. 6. Ken Cuccinelli: A possible candidate, as stated above. 7. Reconstruction: A historical time period, not a person, so it cannot be the lieutenant governor. 8. Republican: This is a political party, not a person, so it cannot be the lieutenant governor. 9. Richmond: This is a city in Virginia, not a person, so it cannot be the lieutenant governor. 10. Virginia: This is the state in question, not a person, so it cannot be the lieutenant governor. 11. Washington: This is a city in the USA, not a person, so it cannot be the lieutenant governor. After evaluating all options, the possible candidates are Bill Bolling and Ken Cuccinelli. Among these two options, the one that better fits the context where it mentions \\"lieutenant governor since 2006\\" is: - Bolling has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: The church at the north end of the village of Skenfrith, Monmouthshire, Wales is named for what patron saint of Ireland? Answer:","completion":"The church at the north end of the village of Skenfrith, Monmouthshire, Wales, is named after St. Bridget, also known as St. Brigid of Kildare. St. Bridget is an important figure in Irish history and is considered one of the patron saints of Ireland, alongside St. Patrick and St. Columba. Born in the 5th century, St. Bridget was the daughter of a pagan Irish chieftain and a Christian slave. Despite her father's disapproval, she decided to follow the Christian faith from an early age. She dedicated her life to helping the poor, and as her influence grew, she established several monasteries, with the most famous one being in Kildare. St. Bridget became an essential figure in the early Irish church, and her reputation for holiness and compassionate work spread throughout the British Isles. The church in Skenfrith was constructed during the 13th century, a time when the Normans held power in the region. It is likely that the church was named after St. Bridget because of the strong connections and shared religious history between Wales and Ireland at that time. The story of St. Bridget specifically resonated with the people of Wales, who would have admired her for her emphasis on community service, education, and spiritual growth. Furthermore, St. Bridget's strong connection with women and her role as a powerful female saint in the predominantly male-dominated world of medieval Christianity would have been appealing to the local population. The church of St. Bridget in Skenfrith is not only an architectural marvel but also a repository of Wales' medieval history. It showcases the relationship between Wales and Ireland, and how the saints and religious figures of Ireland inspired and shaped the spiritual landscape of Wales. In conclusion, the church at the north end of the village of Skenfrith, Monmouthshire, Wales is named after St. Bridget of Kildare, one of the patron saints of Ireland. This connection is emblematic of the strong cultural and religious ties between Wales and Ireland during the 13th century, and St. Bridget's values and works continue to inspire and resonate with the people of Wales to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Conservative MP Scott Reid attacked Canada's election watchdog Tuesday, calling him \\"overly aggressive\\" and arguing it was \\"inappropriate\\" to notify the House Speaker about a dispute with an MP. Marc Mayrand, the chief electoral officer who oversees Elections Canada, appeared before the procedure and House affairs committee to discuss the dispute between Elections Canada and Manitoba Conservative MP James Bezan. Bezan has gone to court to fight the agency over whether he overspent in his 2006, 2008 and 2011 election campaigns. Elections Canada says the MP re-used signs and assessed them at a lower value because they were used, when the law requires the signs to be assessed at their purchase value. The law's intent is to ensure incumbents don't have a financial advantage over new candidates. Under the Canada Elections Act, MPs who don't comply with the rules for filing expenses can be barred from sitting or voting in the House. Mayrand wrote to House Speaker Andrew Scheer last May to tell him about the dispute with Bezan, MP for Selkirk-Interlake, Man., as well as with Shelly Glover, MP for Saint Boniface, Man. Glover's campaign reached a compliance agreement with Elections Canada shortly before she was appointed to cabinet. MPs can go to court and ask to be relieved of the requirement to update their filings, something Bezan has done. Reid attacked Mayrand for writing the letters to Scheer. \\"You think that you are obliged to act before the courts have been consulted?\\" Reid asked Mayrand during the committee meeting. \\"I feel that I need to alert the Speaker. I'm not taking a position on the right[s] of the member, simply advising the Speaker of the situation,\\" Mayrand said. Reid pointed out that meant they differ on whether Mayrand was wrong to do so. \\"I think you acted in a manner the act does not require you to act and I think it was an overly aggressive manner which was frankly inappropriate. You disagree with that, which is cool. I would hope that you would be supportive of your own position of this,\\" Reid said. Reid asked Mayrand whether he felt the agency should investigate previous campaign overspending even if an MP won a subsequent election, essentially rendering moot the earlier result. Mayrand referred to the section of the Canada Elections Act that applies to maintaining accurate campaign spending records. \\"Section 463 doesn't make a difference between how long [ago] the election took place,\\" Mayrand said. \\"It's not because an election is gone that there's no longer a duty to account for that,\\" he added. \\"The whole purpose of the legislation is to ensure that there be accurate returns [filings]. And it's all about transparency and accountability for the expenditures and the transactions that occur during the campaign. And again, from time to time, information may require that returns be amended to reflect accurately what happened during that campaign.\\" Mayrand suggested MPs need a court decision before they can continue to do their work. \\"They have to apply to a court to be relieved and until they’ve obtained this relief, they can’t sit,\\" Mayrand said, speaking to reporters outside the committee room. In most cases where the election agency threatened an MP's ability to vote, he said, the MPs \\"were very diligent, went right to the court right away and got relief from the deadline.\\" Mayrand said the threat of losing the ability to vote is a very effective tool in the election agency's arsenal. He said it's been used repeatedly over the years and \\"only very, very few cases have gone to the Speaker,\\" he said. \\"The vast majority of candidates, when they’re brought to this situation, will correct their return or [in a] timely [way] seek a court order to be relieved of a deadline... Because candidates understand the importance of those provisions and they act accordingly.\\" It's also possible to file the return under protest and still pursue relief in court, he added. Mayrand said lawyers for Elections Canada and for Bezan are in \\"very active discussion\\" over how to resolve the situation without having a court hearing. Bezan, in a June 4 statement, referred to the dispute as an accounting disagreement and said he had complied with the law. Mayrand reiterated a call for Elections Canada to be given more power because witnesses in a number of cases are refusing to speak to them. \\"What we’ve seen in the cases where there is an investigation triggered, it’s getting difficult for the commissioner to gather the evidence. He doesn’t get necessarily all the time the co-operation that he would reasonably expect from parties who have information on a file,\\" Mayrand said. Commissioner of Canada Elections Yves Côté is responsible for enforcing the Canada Elections Act. The Conservatives have been promising to introduce an update to Canadian election law. Last April, then-minister of state for democratic reform Tim Uppal said he would introduce legislation that week. The next day, the government cancelled the bill's introduction, and won't say when they will bring it back. They also wouldn't explain why they yanked it. Mayrand says he hasn't been consulted on the legislation. Ontario MP Jeff Watson is facing a similar complaint by Elections Canada over his 2011 election spending. This isn't the first time Conservative MPs have faced corrections to their campaign files, or even allegations of wrongdoing. Last year, Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Peter Penashue stepped down to run in a byelection after CBC News revealed his campaign had dramatically overspent and taken corporate donations, which aren't allowed under Canadian law. Penashue lost his re-election bid. Conservative MP Dean Del Mastro has been charged with intentionally overspending in his 2008 campaign and trying to cover it up. Del Mastro maintains he ran a clean campaign.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Compliments are one of the most important parts of romantic relationships. They show your partner that you appreciate their efforts and make you two grow closer. Don’t hold back on the compliments. If your partner does something that impresses you or looks especially good, tell them! Be specific with your compliments. Rather than saying, “You look nice,” say “That dress looks amazing on you.” This shows that you’re being observant. Remember that compliments don’t just have to be about looks. Saying, “You’re such a great cook” after dinner is another flattering compliment. This is another way to show your appreciation for what your partner does. People love feeling appreciated, and knowing that you notice the things your partner does for you will bring them closer to you. Don’t hesitate to thank your partner whenever they do something for you. Even thanking your partner for mundane tasks like taking out the garbage works to show appreciation. Always make your appreciation genuine, without any sarcasm or sounding like a backhanded compliment. Don’t say something like, “I’m glad you finally remembered to do the dishes after dinner tonight.” This sounds sarcastic. Simply say, “Thank you for doing the dishes.” Physical touch is a huge part of attraction. Take as many opportunities to build this attraction as you can. Hold their hand when you’re walking together. Give them arm touches when you’re talking. Kiss their forehead randomly. These little touches help build the intimacy between you two. When you start off, don’t make any of your touches sexual. You can build to that. Start by just establishing a physical connection between you and your partner. Remember that if your partner ever tells you to stop touching them, listen to them. Sometimes being straightforward is the best approach. Don’t make your partner guess what your feelings are. Tell them directly that you love them. Hearing that will bring your partner closer to you. Find creative ways to tell your partner you love them. Leave little love notes around your home for them to find. Send a random text message. Change it up to keep them guessing. Follow up saying, “I love you” with a kiss or a good hug.

In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: \\"The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.\\" He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature.

The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

After a few threats and some fighting he collects the debt.

There are several factors in this review that contribute to this negative impact on my purchasing decision: 1. The reviewer's strong dissatisfaction: The reviewer states that if they could give the product a zero-star rating, they would. This intense level of dissatisfaction is an immediate red flag and raises concerns regarding the quality and value of the product. 2. Negative comparison to previous versions: The reviewer mentions that this \\"remaster\\" is terrible compared to the previous Virgin remasters done by Bob Ludwig, implying a decline in quality. As a potential buyer, I would naturally want to invest in a product that is considered better or at least equal to its previous versions; this review suggests that this release fails to meet that expectation. 3. Loss of dynamic range: The reviewer claims that the remaster has had all the dynamic range taken out of it in an effort to optimize it for iPod use. This suggests that the product may lose essential qualities or might not deliver the intended experience, which could be discouraging for potential buyers. 4. Apprehension about other re-issues: The reviewer expresses their suspicion that other re-issues might have similar issues. This raises concerns for potential buyers as it might indicate a pattern of poor quality across a range of related products. 5. Link to technical analysis: The reviewer provides a link to a technical analysis on a professional forum (Gearslutz), which could further validate their negative opinion on the product. By sharing an external source that discusses the issues in detail, the reviewer gives potential buyers more reason to question the product's quality. In conclusion, this review would decrease the chances of me buying the product as it highlights serious concerns about the remaster's quality, loss of dynamic range, and potential issues with other related re-issues.

Prosecutors allege that Gordillo used union funds to buy two homes near San Diego and transferred 2.1 million to a Neiman Marcus account. These transactions reportedly took place between 2008 and 2012. Additionally, an estimated 2 million of union money was funneled into accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Given the question: This article: After the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\" He said he was told his songwriting was \\"not up to par\\", the sound was \\"unlistenable\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\\" However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. According to Cobain, \\"Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that. This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\\"The band members began to have doubts about the record's sound. During this time, Cobain admitted, \\"The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong. The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\\" The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. The producer declined; as he recalled, \\"[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.'

It rises at an altitude of on Plynlimon, close to the Ceredigion/Powys border near Llanidloes, in the Cambrian Mountains of mid Wales. It then flows through Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, with the county towns of Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester on its banks. With an average discharge of at Apperley, Gloucestershire, the Severn is the greatest river in terms of water flow in England and Wales. - Shrewsbury (or ) is the county town of Shropshire, England. It is on the River Severn and has a population of approximately 72,000. - Aston Pigott is a hamlet approximately 12 miles west of Shrewsbury within the parish of Worthen and Shelve . The current population stands at around 50 . The hamlet is situated on a small rise giving many of the properties an outstanding view across the Rea Brook valley to the Stiperstones . It contains three working farms that are mainly dairy and lamb farms . The hamlet is served primarily by Worthen which is 1 mile to the west . It adjoins Aston Rogers . The name Aston Pigott probably evolved from East Tun or Town and from the name of the Picot family of Norman descent . In 1180 Ralph Fitz Picot was granted lands by the Corbets , and it was Ralph 's descendants , notably Robert Pigot in 1255 followed by Howel Pigot who established the modern village name .

It borders Powys and Wrexham in Wales to the west and north-west, Cheshire to the north, Staffordshire to the east, Worcestershire to the south-east and Herefordshire to the south. Shropshire Council was created in 2009, a unitary authority taking over from the previous county council and five district councils. The borough of Telford and Wrekin has been a separate unitary authority since 1998 but continues to be included in the ceremonial county. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. - The name Rea Brook can refer to either of two brooks (a local term for a small river) in Shropshire, England. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Worthen is a village in Shropshire, England approximately 13 miles west of Shrewsbury. The village forms part of the Worthen with Shelve civil parish, which includes the hamlet of Little Worthen immediately to the north-east and the villages of Brockton and Pennerley, in addition to several smaller settlements. It sits in the Rea Brook valley. To the south are the Stiperstones and the Bromlow Callow, known for the small clump of trees on top. To the north is Long Mountain. - The Stiperstones is a distinctive hill in the county of Shropshire, England. It is a quartzite ridge formed some 480 million years ago. During the last Ice Age the summit stood out above the glaciers and was subject to constant freezing and thawing which shattered the quartzite into a mass of jumbled scree surrounding several residual rocky tors. At above sea level it is the second-highest hill in the county, surpassed only by Brown Clee Hill.

The gruesome details divulged in the courtroom sent shockwaves through those in attendance, painting a disturbing picture of a man seemingly contemplating the violent crime just hours before it occurred. Details of the Testimony: The suspect, whose identity has not been disclosed due to legal restrictions, has been accused of brutally stabbing a 75-year old man in what prosecutors have described as a \\"random and unprovoked\\" attack. The elderly victim, who also remains unnamed, was found dead in his home with multiple stab wounds, including a fatal slash across his neck. The tragic incident has left a community in fear and sorrow as they continue to grapple with the senseless loss of a beloved member. In the courtroom, the prosecution stated that the suspect had been consuming drugs and alcohol throughout the day before the alleged murder. Friends of the accused testified that the suspect had been behaving erratically, with one friend recalling the suspect's chilling statement about his desire to slit someone's throat. The testimony indicates that the suspect seemed to have been fixated on carrying out a heinous crime, with the defense arguing that the suspect had been acting under the influence of a cocktail of intoxicants that impaired his judgment. Furthermore, earlier that day, the suspect was seen loitering outside the victim's property, arousing suspicion from neighbors and passersby. The prosecution argues that the murder was a premeditated act, with the suspect staking out the victim's home before launching his brutal attack. Community Impact: The brutal nature of this crime has deeply shocked the community. Neighbors have spoken about their fears for their own safety, with some expressing concerns about the general decline in security and an increase in violent crime in the area. Local leaders have stressed the importance of working together to prevent and resolve criminal activity while maintaining close communication with law enforcement. Efforts to Secure Justice: Meanwhile, the investigation into the murder continues as authorities seek to establish concrete evidence and resolve any remaining gaps in the case. Detectives have been scouring CCTV footage, collecting witness statements, and piecing together the chain of events leading up to the harrowing incident. The prosecution and the defense have been working diligently to present their respective cases, with the defense questioning the reliability of the suspect's alleged admission due to his impaired state during the period in question. As the trial progresses, the jury will be tasked with deciding whether the suspect's chilling remarks were merely the ramblings of an intoxicated individual or a genuine expression of violent intentions that culminated in a horrific crime. Conclusion: This shocking case, underscored by the suspect's chilling statement about his desire to commit an undeniably heinous act, brings to light the grim reality of increasing acts of violence in society. As the community mourns the loss of an innocent life, the trial serves as a reminder of the importance of remaining vigilant against the threat of violent crime. Authorities and the public alike must remain proactive in their efforts to ensure justice is served and that communities are protected from senseless acts of aggression. The hope for a safer future is not unattainable, but it requires collective action, compassion, and dedication to overcome the darkness that casts shadows of fear and despair."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Is Terry Lynch Washington’s most annoying man? You decide. At his office the next day, he listens to each of his 48 messages. He scribbles down the details he then reports on the District’s non-emergency Web site or in e-mails to bureaucrats, most ending with “Respectfully” or “Respectfully yours” or “Just wanted to bring these to your attention.” He repeats this ritual several times a week, not because it’s his job, per se, but because he cannot help himself. Washington is a city of professional nags, many of them migrating from across the country to agitate, lobby, champion and nudge on such high-minded issues as health care and Social Security. Lynch, 52, the head of a coalition of religious organizations, is perfectly capable of opining about the state of District school reform (“Stalled,” he says.) or the spate of scandals laying waste to the city’s elected leaders (“Tragic.”). He can see the proverbial forest through the trees. But that dead maple at 15th and Irving? Or those missing crosswalk stripes at 11th and Columbia? Or the streetlight on New York Avenue that’s on during the day? “Look at this!” he says with each new discovery, his small frame stiffening as if he hadn’t just seen something very similar moments before. After one of Lynch’s many notes, his D.C. Council member wrote back and dismissed his reports as “armchair emails.” His wife, far more charitable, rejects the suggestion that she might be married to Washington’s Most Annoying Man. But she acknowledges that she will not join him for a stroll from their Mount Pleasant rowhouse to Dupont Circle because he will stop every 10 feet to record another outbreak of urban blight. “The town should be green, clean and safe,” he says. “First class. Why not?” Every community seems to have at least one: the citizen activist, the gadfly, someone like Robert Atkins, 67, a retiree who considers it his civic duty to attend every meeting of the Arlington County Board and pronounce its members thoroughly incompetent. Or Montgomery County’s Robin Ficker, a lawyer who for years has given county officials fits in forcing anti-tax and term-limit referendums. What distinguishes Lynch is that he doesn’t stick to his block or even his neighborhood. Anywhere he happens to be in the District — the streets around RFK Stadium, Tenleytown, Anacostia — is fair game. As executive director of the Downtown Cluster of Congregations, Lynch considers it part of his mission to ensure that public streetscapes are well maintained. But his passion for perfectly appointed tree boxes and graffiti-free mailboxes extends well beyond his job. Nights, weekends, holidays — Lynch won’t let it go. He registers his complaints whether he agrees with the policies of the mayor in power (Adrian Fenty) or disagrees with them (Vincent Gray).

DVDs are generally considered to provide a sharper and clearer image than LaserDiscs. Comparing and contrasting LaserDiscs and DVDs could provide a better understanding of why the latter is said to appear better. LaserDisc, which debuted in 1978, was the first optical disc format used for home video. It was a substantial improvement over videotapes in terms of video and audio quality. However, LaserDisc has some limitations when compared to DVD, which was introduced later in 1997. Here are a few key differences between LaserDiscs and DVDs that highlight why the DVD format appears sharper and clearer to most viewers: 1. Video resolution: LaserDiscs use analog video with a resolution of around 425 vertical lines, whereas DVDs use digital video with resolutions of 720 x 480 pixels (NTSC) or 720 x 576 pixels (PAL). The increased resolution of DVDs results in a clearer and more detailed image. 2. Video compression: DVDs use the MPEG-2 video compression standard, which enables them to store and efficiently deliver high-quality video. LaserDiscs, on the other hand, use composite video (a lesser quality analog video signal) that is uncompressed, leading to a less sharp video quality. 3. Video Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): DVDs have a higher SNR than LaserDiscs, which means they provide a more accurate and less noisy video signal. A higher SNR leads to better image quality and less distortion in the displayed video. 4. Storage capacity: DVDs have a much larger storage capacity compared to LaserDiscs, allowing them to store more data in the form of higher-quality video and audio. A single-sided, single-layer DVD can store up to 4.7 GB of data, while a LaserDisc can hold approximately 60 minutes of analog video on each side. This extra capacity for DVDs allows for more detailed visuals, better audio, and supplementary material. 5. Error correction: DVDs incorporate advanced digital error correction technology, resulting in fewer errors during playback and a better overall viewing experience. LaserDiscs, as an analog format, are more prone to visible distortions and disturbances in playback, due to surface flaws or dust on the disc. In summary, while both LaserDiscs and DVDs had their own advantages when introduced, it is the DVD format that provides a sharper and clearer image quality due to its higher video resolution, improved video compression, better signal-to-noise ratio, increased storage capacity, and advanced error correction technology. Consequently, LaserDiscs' lower performance in these areas makes DVDs the superior choice concerning image quality and overall viewing experience for most viewers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The end of Patience Camp was signalled on the evening of 8 April, when the floe suddenly split. The camp now found itself on a small triangular raft of ice; a break-up of this would mean disaster, so Shackleton readied the lifeboats for the party's enforced departure. He had now decided they would try, if possible, to reach the distant Deception Island because a small wooden church had been reportedly erected for the benefit of whalers. This could provide a source of timber that might enable them to construct a seaworthy boat.At 1 p.m. on 9 April, the Dudley Docker was launched, and an hour later all three boats were away. Shackleton himself commanded the James Caird, Worsley the Dudley Docker, and navigating officer Hubert Hudson was nominally in charge of the Stancomb Wills, though because of his precarious mental state the effective commander was Tom Crean.The boats were surrounded by ice, dependent upon leads of water opening up, and progress was perilous and erratic. Frequently the boats were tied to floes, or dragged up onto them, while the men camped and waited for conditions to improve. Shackleton was wavering again between several potential destinations, and on 12 April, rejected the various island options and decided on Hope Bay, at the very tip of Graham Land. However, conditions in the boats, in temperatures sometimes as low as −20 °F (−29 °C), with little food and regular soakings in icy seawater, were wearing the men down, physically and mentally. Shackleton therefore decided that Elephant Island, the nearest of the possible refuges, was now the most practical option.On 14 April, the boats lay off the south-east coast of Elephant Island, but could not land as the shore consisted of perpendicular cliffs and glaciers. Next day the James Caird rounded the eastern point of the island, to reach the northern lee shore, and discovered a narrow shingle beach. Soon afterwards, the three boats, which had been separated during the previous night, were reunited at this landing place. It was apparent from...

Today, we are going to learn about the early migration in New Zealand in 1858 and the differences in the number of males and females who went there. Back in those days, many people decided to move to faraway lands, like New Zealand, in search of new opportunities and adventures. In 1858, a big wave of migration, which is when people move from one place to another, happened in New Zealand. Now, let's talk about the number of boys and girls, or men and women, who moved to New Zealand during that time. Just like in a classroom, there can be more boys or more girls; the same thing happened during this migration. In 1858, there were more males, which means boys and men, than females, or girls and women, that moved to New Zealand. So, how many more males than females were there? Well, there isn't an exact number we can give you because, back then, people didn't keep track of everything like we do today. But we know for sure there were more males than females in New Zealand during the early migration in 1858. Why were there more males than females? One possible reason is that many men went to New Zealand to find work, especially in tough jobs like farming, building, and mining. It was more common for men, rather than women, to do these difficult tasks in those days. In conclusion, during the early migration in New Zealand in 1858, there were more males than females. Think of it like a big group of people moving to a new place, and there were more boys and men compared to girls and women within that group. It's important to remember that people from the past had different ideas and reasons for doing things than we do now.

In the paragraph, the author is discussing the perception of their country in terms of freedom and the ability to succeed irrespective of one's background. They mention that the way other countries view them does not necessarily stem from envy but is based on how their nation conducts itself in foreign policy - namely, this refers to the interactions and relationships maintained with other countries, as well as international agreements and alliances they may partake in.

When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done.

In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti).

His refusal and subsequent actions are attributed to have ignited the flames of what later became known as the First War of Indian Independence or the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, which was a significant event in Indian history. To understand the context of his refusal, we need to look at the backdrop of the situation in India during that period. The British East India Company had been gradually expanding its territories and exercising control over various parts of India. By the mid-19th century, the Indian troops (sepoys) serving in the Company's army faced multiple issues, including discriminatory treatment and cultural insensitivity, that led to their dissatisfaction and resentment. In 1856, the British introduced a new rifle called the Pattern 1853 Enfield rifled musket, which used cartridges greased with a mixture of tallow (derived from beef fat) and lard (from pork fat). These cartridges needed to be bitten at one end to release the gunpowder before they could be loaded into the rifle. For the Hindu soldiers, this was potentially a violation of religious beliefs as cows are considered sacred in Hinduism. Likewise, for the Muslim soldiers, the use of pig fat was offensive as it went against their religious beliefs, where the consumption of pork is strictly forbidden. On March 29, 1857, Mangal Pandey, a 29-year-old sepoy, took a stand against the use of these cartridges. At the Barrackpore parade ground near Calcutta (now Kolkata), Pandey refused to use the greased cartridge and rebelled against his British officers. He encouraged his fellow sepoys to do the same, leading the way in open defiance. It is said that Pandey was intoxicated at that time and tried to attack Lieutenant Henry Baugh, the Adjutant of his regiment. Baugh managed to escape his initial attack, and other sepoys intervened to hold Pandey back. Although Pandey’s direct actions were suppressed, his defiance and resistance resonated with the sepoys who were uneasy with the British rule, and ultimately led to a much larger uprising in the form of the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. Mangal Pandey was apprehended and court-martialed on charges of treason. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. On April 8, 1857, Mangal Pandey was hanged, marking the beginning of a series of revolts and uprisings across northern and central India. Mangal Pandey's refusal to use the greased cartridge served as a catalyst for the First War of Indian Independence, which profoundly impacted the course of India's history. The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 eventually led to the dissolution of the British East India Company's rule in 1858, and the subsequent establishment of direct British Crown control over India, known as the British Raj. Mangal Pandey's legacy lives on, as he is considered a prominent figure in India's struggle for independence, and his refusal to compromise his beliefs and values paved the way for future generations to continue fighting for their freedom."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Associated Press) IDYLLWILD, Calif. (AP) — A fast-moving wildfire — believed to have been sparked by arson — tore through trees, burned five homes and forced evacuation orders for an entire forest town as California sweltered under a heat wave and battled ferocious fires at both ends of the state. The so-called Cranston Fire, which erupted Wednesday in the San Jacinto Mountains east of Los Angeles, turned into a wall of flame that torched timber and tinder-dry brush. In a matter of hours it grew to 7 1/2 square miles (19 square kilometers). It was threatening an estimated 600 homes, authorities said. The fire was the largest of at least five that police believe were purposely set Wednesday by a man whose car was reportedly spotted at the starting point of the blaze in Riverside County, officials said. Brandon N. McGlover, 32, of Temecula was booked on suspicion of five counts of arson, state fire officials said. It wasn't clear whether he had an attorney. Authorities ordered residents to leave Idyllwild and several neighboring communities, home to about 12,000 people. William Blodgett of Idyllwild said he couldn't get home because of the fire and had to wait along with others at a gas station in nearby Mountain Center — until the fire hopped a highway and began to move in his direction. \\"We were all peeling out of there as fast as we could,\\" he told KNBC-TV. \\"It was apocalyptic.\\" Horses and other animals were taken to shelters as were several hundred children who were evacuated from summer camps. About 200 were at a local high school serving as a shelter, KCAL-TV reported. The fire in the San Bernardino National Forest sent up a cloud 50,000 feet high that was so enormous it created its own weather in the form of lightning, the National Weather Service reported. Throughout the day, helicopters and planes dumped water and fire retardant that turned swathes of land and homes pink. Fire engines also were stationed to protect homes. The fire is one of several across California amid a heat wave that has seen days of triple-digit temperatures. To the north, in the San Francisco Bay Area, at least one home burned in a fast-moving blaze in Clayton, where houses are spread out around windy roads. Yosemite Valley, the scenic heart of the national park, was closed at noon Wednesday during the height of tourist season as smoke cast a pall on the region from a fire in the Sierra Nevada. The closure was heartbreaking for travelers, many of whom mapped out their trips months in advance to hike and climb amid the spectacular views of cascading waterfalls and sheer rock faces. \\"We had one guest who planned a weeklong trip,\\" said Tom Lambert, who owns a vacation rental property near Yosemite Valley. \\"It was a father-daughter trip, for her high school graduation ... Now it's done. It's sad.\\" Another guest had to delay plans to climb Half Dome. Officials emphasized that Yosemite wasn't in imminent danger from the fire. Authorities decided on the shutdown to allow crews to perform protective measures such as burning away brush along roadways without having to deal with traffic in the park that welcomes 4 million visitors annually. Yosemite Valley will be closed until at least Sunday, along with a winding, mountainous, 20-mile (32-kilometer) stretch of California's State Route 41 that leads into the area, Gediman said. At least 1,000 campground and hotel bookings were canceled — to say nothing of the impact on day visitors, park workers and small businesses along the highway, Gediman said. The last time the 7.5-mile-long (12-kilometer-long) valley was closed because of fire was 1990, he said. Over nearly two weeks, flames have churned through 60 square miles (155 square kilometers) of timber in steep terrain of the Sierra Nevada just west of the park. The fire was just 25 percent contained. More than 3,300 firefighters are working the fire, aided by 16 helicopters. One firefighter was killed July 14, and six others have been injured. In the state's far north, a 7-square-mile (18-square-kilometer) wildfire has forced the evacuation of French Gulch, a small Shasta County community that dates to the Gold Rush. ___ Noah Berger reported from Yosemite; Chris Weber from Los Angeles.

An enforcement stop was conducted by the CHP, Riverside County Sheriff's Department and Hemet Police Department and the driver was arrested. Authorities had not yet confirmed whether the man captured on video being detained by officers was McGlover. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered for residents of Idyllwild, Mountain Center along McGaugh and McCall Park roads and the communities of Pine Cove and Fern Valley. Cranston Fire Rips Through Homes (Published Wednesday, July 25, 2018) \\"Leave the area immediately,\\" a USFS Twitter post advised. At least 110 homes in southwest Idyllwild have been evacuated, and officials said at least 600 more structures were threatened by the blaze. Television news footage showed at least a few homes going up in flames. Authorities have established an evacuation center for residents and campers at Banning High School, 100 W. Westward Ave. Small animals can also be evacuated to Banning High School, while animals of all sizes can be taken to the San Jacinto Valley Animal Campus at 581 S. Grand Ave. Road closures include state Route 74 between the Cranston Fire Station and Lake Hemet, as well as state Route 243 between the communities of Pine Cove and Mountain Center, where authorities say flames jumped the highway near the Idyllwild Grinding Facility. The fire has also taken out power to more than 7,700 Southern California Edison customers in the Idyllwild area, according to an SCE online outage map. Full restoration was expected at around 2 a.m. Thursday. Authorities have also issued a smoke advisory for the region, advising that winds could bring smoke into various parts of Riverside County, including the Coachella Valley, Banning Pass, the Hemet/San Jacinto Valley, Perris Valley and Anza. The advisory will be in effect through Thursday morning. McGlover was also accused of setting several other fires Wednesday in the southwest Riverside County area and along Highway 74. A fire information call center for the public has also been established at (909) 383-5688. |||||Summary:","completion":"A big fire called the \\"Cranston Fire\\" started in a place called Idyllwild, which is in the state of California. The fire grew very big, very fast and burnt through trees and houses. People who live in the area had to leave their homes to stay safe. The person who started the fire did it on purpose, and he is now in trouble with the police. This is one of many fires happening in California right now because the weather is very hot, which makes it easier for fires to start and spread."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By creating a series of visually striking and informative posters, Kennedy aims to dismantle widespread misconceptions about chemicals being innately dangerous or artificial. His overarching goal is to demonstrate that chemistry is not only a natural science, but also an omnipresent part of everyday life. Step 1: Introducing James Kennedy and His Motivation James Kennedy, an experienced chemistry teacher from Australia, observed that many people harbor irrational fears and prejudices towards chemicals. He realized that this fear stemmed from a lack of understanding and a tendency to view chemicals as purely artificial and harmful substances. To combat this issue, he began creating posters that illustrated the importance and omnipresence of chemistry in the world around us. Step 2: The Posters and Their Purpose Kennedy's posters are designed with the purpose of dispelling the myth that all synthetic substances are harmful while natural substances are inherently safe. By incorporating vivid imagery and detailed information about common items and their chemical components, his posters educate viewers about the complex relationships between chemicals, nature, and human society. Step 3: The Posters' Reception and Impact Kennedy's posters have garnered a significant following and received praise for their effectiveness in communicating complex information in a visually appealing and accessible manner. Teachers, students, and science enthusiasts have found them to be a valuable resource for promoting a better understanding of chemistry and its applications. Step 4: Quotes From the creator In discussing the motivation behind his posters, Kennedy has expressed a desire to \\"erode the fear that many people have of 'chemicals'.\\" He further elaborates on his intentions by stating, \\"These posters aim to show that chemistry isn't artificial and dangerous; but that chemistry is natural and everywhere.\\" Step 5: Conclusion James Kennedy's innovative posters serve as a prime example of the power of creative education and communication in breaking down barriers to understanding complex subjects such as chemistry. By tackling misconceptions head-on and presenting information in an easily digestible format, he has not only raised awareness about the true nature of chemicals but also highlighted the importance of embracing science as a vital and enriching aspect of our lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10 Hz to 3×10 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German (German-Dutch to be precise) scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it \\"X-radiation\\" to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of \\"X-ray(s)\\" in the English language includes the variants \\"x-ray(s)\\", \\"xray(s)\\", and \\"X ray(s)\\". - A brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is defined as the brightest galaxy in a cluster of galaxies. BCGs include the most massive galaxies in the universe. They are generally elliptical galaxies which lie close to the geometric and kinematical center of their host galaxy cluster, hence at the bottom of the cluster potential well. They are also generally coincident with the peak of the cluster X-ray emission. - A light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances. It is about 9 trillion kilometres or 6 trillion miles. As defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days). Because it includes the word \\"year\\", the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time. - A potential well is the region surrounding a local minimum of potential energy. Energy captured in a potential well is unable to convert to another type of energy (kinetic energy in the case of a gravitational potential well) because it is captured in the local minimum of a potential well. Therefore, a body may not proceed to the global minimum of potential energy, as it would naturally tend to due to entropy. - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown. - IC 1101 is a supergiant elliptical galaxy at the center of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster, approximately 320 megaparsecs (1.04 billion light-years) from Earth. - A galaxy cluster, or cluster of galaxies, is a structure that consists of anywhere from hundreds to thousands of galaxies that are bound together by gravity with typical masses ranging from 1010 solar masses. They are the largest known gravitationally bound structures in the universe and were believed to be the largest known structures in the universe until the 1980s, when superclusters were discovered. One of the key features of clusters is the intracluster medium (ICM). The ICM consists of heated gas between the galaxies and has a peak temperature between 215 keV that is dependent on the total mass of the cluster. Galaxy clusters should not be confused with star clusters, such as open clusters, which are structures of stars \\"within\\" galaxies, or with globular clusters, which typically orbit galaxies. Small aggregates of galaxies are referred to as groups of galaxies rather than clusters of galaxies. The groups and clusters can themselves cluster together to form superclusters. - An elliptical galaxy is a type of galaxy having an approximately ellipsoidal shape and a smooth, nearly featureless brightness profile. Unlike flat spiral galaxies with organization and structure, they are more three-dimensional, without much structure, and their stars are in somewhat random orbits around the center. They are one of the three main classes of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work \\"The Realm of the Nebulae\\", along with spiral and lenticular galaxies. Elliptical galaxies range in shape from nearly spherical to highly flat and in size from tens of millions to over one hundred trillion stars. Originally Edwin Hubble hypothesized that elliptical galaxies evolved into spiral galaxies, which was later discovered to be false. Stars found inside of elliptical galaxies are much older than stars found in spiral galaxies. - Abell 2029 or A2029 is a large cluster of galaxies 315 megaparsecs ( 1,027 million light - years ) away in the constellation Virgo . A2029 is a Bautz - Morgan classification type I cluster due to its large central galaxy , IC 1101 .

Our goal is to find the value of 'q' in the equation -55*q + 2703 = 19*q + 1149. Step 1: Since we want to find 'q,' we need to get all the 'q' parts together on one side of the equation. So let's move '19*q' from the right side to the left side: (-55*q - 19*q) + 2703 = 1149 Step 2: Now we can add -55*q and -19*q together: -74*q + 2703 = 1149 Step 3: To find the value of 'q,' we need to move the numbers that don't involve 'q' to the other side. So, we'll subtract '2703' from both sides of the equation: -74*q = 1149 - 2703 Step 4: Let's do the subtraction we just set up: -74*q = -1554 Step 5: Finally, to find 'q,' we need to divide both sides by '-74': q = -1554 / -74 Step 6: Do the division: q = 21 So, the value of 'q' in this equation is 21."},{"prompt":"If someone is fiddling with something what skill do they likely have?

Question: Process: - Thunderstorms form over the ocean - An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating - When the wind speeds reach 74 mph the storm is considered a hurricane. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Bad weather occurs happens, how will it affect MORE POWERFUL hurricanes. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that bad weather might have an effect on the development of more powerful hurricanes. In this case, if bad weather occurs during the processes involved in forming a hurricane, it could potentially have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effect: Bad weather events such as increased precipitation or changes in temperature may affect the initial thunderstorms forming over the ocean. This could lead to either an increase or decrease in the intensity of these storms, depending on the specific weather conditions. As several thunderstorms come together around an area of low pressure, the intensity of these combined storms might be altered due to the bad weather conditions, potentially resulting in more powerful hurricanes. Indirect effect: Bad weather could affect ocean conditions, such as sea surface temperature and the distribution of warm ocean water. Since hurricanes are fueled by warm ocean water, changes in these ocean conditions may impact the strength of developing hurricanes. For example, if bad weather leads to increased sea surface temperatures, it may provide more energy for the storms, ultimately leading to more powerful hurricanes. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that bad weather can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of hurricane formation.

Q:- Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the process after waste and excess fluid have been separated from the filtered blood is urine formation and excretion. This involves the following steps: 1. Collection of filtered waste and excess fluid: The waste and excess fluid that have passed through the kidneys' filtering system ultimately form urine. This urine is collected in tiny tubules called collecting ducts present in the kidney's functional units, the nephrons. 2. Urine concentration: As the urine passes through the collecting ducts, the kidneys adjust the concentration of water and solutes, ensuring the body maintains proper fluid balance. This regulation is primarily carried out by a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which controls the permeability of the collecting ducts. 3. Transport to the bladder: Once the urine is formed and concentrated in the collecting ducts, it moves into larger tubes called the renal pelvis, which is present in each kidney. From the renal pelvis, the urine is transported through long tubes called ureters that connect the kidneys to the urinary bladder. 4. Urine storage and excretion: The urinary bladder serves as a storage organ for urine until it is ultimately removed from the body. When the bladder is full, nerve signals trigger the need to urinate. During urination, the bladder muscles contract, and the urinary sphincter muscles (located at the bladder's exit) relax, allowing the urine to pass through the urethra and exit the body. In summary, the last step of the process involves urine formation through the collection and concentration of waste and fluid, followed by its transport to the bladder and ultimately its excretion from the body."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 3: Making the comparison - The first sentence says '...with Sarath Babu, Sujatha, and Saritha.', while in the second sentence states 'starring Saritha, Sujatha, and Sarath Babu'. The difference here is simply a matter of word choice and order, with no impact on the overall conveyed information. Therefore, despite the slight differences in word choice and sentence structure, both sentences convey the same essential information about the movie, its release year, the language, and the list of actors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yes. 20 years ago. When I was a lot younger. I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live.

In a news release reported by the AP, two 18-year-olds, Robert Yaskell and Riley Borello-Poythress, were said to have accidentally burned down a playground while attempting to dispose of a love letter from one of their ex-girlfriends. The incident took place on Monday at the playground of Bowman Elementary School. As stated by the police, the teens chose the location to light up a piece of paper, which contained the remnants of past emotions. Following the act, they left the playground. However, the flames from the burning paper continued to spread, causing elements of the playground to catch fire, including highly flammable rubber mulch and two pieces of playground equipment. It wasn't long before firefighters were alerted and dispatched to extinguish the blaze, which they successfully managed to do around 8 pm. According to the authorities, the flames caused significant damage, with the estimated cost of repairs and replacement of the burnt playground structures amounting to 21,000. In the aftermath of the incident, the two teens were identified, and reports indicate that they cooperated with the police during the investigation. However, they failed to report the fire to the authorities themselves, despite being well aware of the unfolding situation. As a consequence of their misguided actions, both Yaskell and Borello-Poythress are now facing charges that include criminal mischief, criminal negligent burning, and failure to control or report a fire. The events in Anchorage demonstrate that even the simplest acts of emotional closure or catharsis can have unintended repercussions that go beyond one's own personal sphere. While dealing with a breakup and letting go of lingering emotions is a taxing process, it is essential to consider the consequences of one's actions, especially when those actions result in fiery forms of release."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

McDonald's customers aren't lovin' the fact the price of their favourite breakfast treat has gone up by 25 cents GETTING your first job at Macca’s is a snap. The fast-food giant has teamed up with Snapchat to launch a McDonald’s-themed filter for the photo messaging app, with jobseekers invited to try on the uniform and send a 10-second video application. Launching on today, the “Snaplications” campaign is being billed as a first for both companies. Once the application is reviewed, McDonald’s will send users back to the digital careers hub where they can download an application form. McDonald’s employs about 106,000 Australians, with 65 per cent under the age of 18. In Australia, Snapchat has more than four million daily users, 82 per cent of whom are young people. “I’ve learnt a lot about Snapchat recently from my 14-year-old daughter,” said Shaun Ruming, chief operating officer of McDonald’s Australia. “We think this is actually a world first. Snaplications is basically a Snapchat ‘lens’ that gives users the ability to apply for a job — or at least commence that process — by sending a 10-second snap. “We’re the largest employer of youth in the country, so we’re trying to look for new and innovative ways to recruit crew people.” Mr Ruming said while the 10-second video wouldn’t replace the traditional hiring process, it would form part of the application. “It certainly won’t replace a thorough face-to-face interview, but we’ll obviously take it into account,” he said. “We’re looking for that positivity, bubbly personality, someone we think would be good in a customer service role. Based on what my daughter sends to her friends, you do get a bit of a glimpse [from a 10-second video].” Mr Ruming said McDonald’s and Snapchat “reached out to each other at a similar time”, after the fast-food chain noticed how many of its crew were using the app. “Snapchat are quite interested to see what the result will be,” he said. “Obviously they’re driven by trying to encourage users onto their platform. We presume when someone applies via Snapchat, when their friends ask them how they got the job, they’ll talk about it.” McDonald’s doesn’t have any firm targets for the experimental campaign. “When we first started talking about it that was one of my questions — how much are we trying to drive recruitment?,” he said. “We’ve been really fortunate with the brand campaign last year, so we’re not in desperate need for hiring, we’re just trying to look for new and innovative ways to complement our existing hiring process.” And the firm doesn’t yet have any plans for other platforms such as Facebook, like pizza chain Domino’s which last month announced it was launching a Facebook Messenger bot to interact with customers. “We just wanted to start with Snapchat and see what reaction we get,” Mr Ruming said. The Snaplications filter will be ‘live’ to all Snapchat users on Friday, after which jobseekers will be able to access it by following a link on the McDonald’s website which will take them back to the app. McDonald’s did not disclose how much it paid for the campaign. Snapchat has been tipped as the new favoured platform among advertisers, with its ads, including sponsored filters, forecast to bring in more than 4 billion (US3 billion) in annual revenue by 2019. Nevertheless, shares in Snap Inc have had a rocky ride since the company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange last month, closing at US20.70 on Wednesday — nearly 30 per cent below their all-time high of US28.84 on March 3. The company currently has a market capitalisation of US24 billion (32 billion). Snapchat, which only began monetising its platform in 2015, generated US404.5 million (536.6 million) in revenue in 2016, with a net loss of US514.6 million (682.6). While expected this early on, some analysts have raised concerns about the rate of losses. This week, former employee Anthony Pompliano claimed Snapchat’s valuation was “built on a house of cards”, in a lawsuit alleging the company misrepresented various metrics including user numbers. Snapchat said the claims were the ramblings of a “disgruntled former employee”. frank.chung@news.com.au ||||| McDonald’s is using a new, social method for attracting employees. The global fast-food titan has started a new “Snaplications” campaign in Australia that uses Snap’s Snapchat (SNAP) app to attract applicants. According to Australian news site News.com.au, which earlier reported on the feature, applicants send a 10-second video to McDonald’s , which functions as a preliminary application. McDonald’s (MCD) then reviews the video and sends the person a link to the company’s careers page, where he or she can fill out an application form. “We think this is actually a world first. Snaplications is basically a Snapchat ‘lens’ that gives users the ability to apply for a job —or at least commence that process—by sending a 10-second snap,” McDonald’s Australia chief operating officer Shaun Ruming told the Australian outlet. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter The Snapchat lens also lets applicants place virtual hats and nametags on their heads and chests to digitally see what it might look like to be one of the company’s 106,000 Australian employees. With more than 160 million active users around the world, Snapchat has become one of the more popular apps for users to share photos and videos with others. Snap, which went public last month and has yet to generate a profit, has been eyeing ways to boost the company’s advertising appeal with big brands. Part of that effort has centered on attracting companies to the service’s relatively young audience. Since McDonald’s still sends applicants to a traditional application form, the Snapchat integration is little more than a different take on a branding campaign aimed at finding younger employees. Ruming, in fact, said that McDonald’s is looking for “new and innovative ways” to find employees and decided to start with Snap’s social app. McDonald’s hasn’t disclosed how much it paid for the Snaplications campaign and whether a similar application process might come to other countries around the world. For those interested in landing a McDonald’s gig through Snapchat, those ten seconds need to count. “We’re looking for that positivity, bubbly personality, someone we think would be good in a customer service role,” Ruming said of the 10-second snap. ||||| Want to work at McDonald's?

Capricorns are naturally ambitious, hard-working people. Most will enjoy discussing their professional goals and the progress they've made toward them. Try talking to her about whatever she's doing to get ahead in life — whether this includes a nine-to-five job or personal projects like art, writing, etc. — and don't be surprised if she's ready to talk about these things at great length. Work may be a topic that you find boring, but don't have to sound like you're asking her robotic questions at a job interview when you talk to her about hers. In fact, with some creativity (and an air of gentle mischief), you can add a little flirty zest to these normally dry questions. Here are just a few examples: Bland questions: \\"Where do you work?\\" \\"What do you do?\\" \\"Do you enjoy that?\\" \\"Where do you see yourself in five years?\\" Zesty questions: \\"So, what's your plan for making your first million?\\" \\"What's your next step in life?\\" \\"Are you more of a Gordon Gekko person or a Lorenzo Anello person?\\" Because they value ambition and determination, most Capricorns respect someone who's worked hard and achieved big successes. However, Capricorns are modest and conservative at heart, so they're unlikely to respond well to extravagant boasting. Instead, try dropping subtle hints about your accomplishments by working them into the conversation naturally. See below for a few examples: Blunt brags: \\"You see these shoes? These are real alligator skin.\\" \\"We should go cruising in my new Bugatti this weekend.\\" \\"I just won employee of the month at my dad's real estate business for the fifth time in a row!\\" Subtle sweet-talking: \\"I'm hoping to use my signing bonus to do something nice for us.\\" \\"I only wear this watch on special occasions — I bought it for myself when I got my Master's.\\" \\"I don't usually do this, but I like to enjoy something nice after things go well at work.\\" Capricorns aren't generally people who will shy from a little friendly sparring. Planning dates that involve some degree of competition can lead to great fun and some serious romantic sparks. However, intense, heated competition is a no-no. Too much competition can lead to resentment and, in addition, Capricorns aren't likely to enjoy the embarrassment of losing at a high-stakes game. Good date ideas: Bowling, cards, mini golf, shooting/archery, arcade games, board games with drinks. Bad date ideas: Street racing, one-on-one street rules basketball, high-stakes poker. If you're dominating at your competition, it may be a good idea to let your date win at least once at whatever you're doing to prevent embarrassment. Try not to make it too obvious that you're letting her win — this can be more embarrassing than losing in the first place. Most Capricorns are practical people that are likely to appreciate a gift a little more for its value and usefulness than for its symbolic meaning. While a piece of jewelry or a bouquet of some fragrant flowers is almost always a sweet gesture, you'll want some of your gifts to be a little more down-to-earth. Try to get her things she'll get continued, long-lasting use and enjoyment out of, rather than one-time thrills. The ideal practical gift for a Capricorn woman depends on her personal hobbies and interests. For instance, if she enjoys drawing, try getting her a high-quality sketch pad and a set of professional pencils. If she's a natural-born athlete, get her a membership to an exclusive gym with the finest exercise equipment. There's no \\"right\\" answer here — it all depends on the woman. While Capricorns are unlikely to appreciate gaudy, ostentatious displays of wealth, they are naturally status-conscious and will enjoy sampling the finer things in life every once in a while. To celebrate special occasions (and sometimes \\"just because\\"), make an effort to treat your Capricorn lover to a fancy time out. Good date ideas: Museums, operas, fancy restaurants, film festivals, art shows, weekend getaways, wineries, etc. Short on cash? It's possible to enjoy the finer things in life on the cheap if you're creative. For instance, try checking a local university's \\"events\\" website — it will usually be possible to see traveling speakers, attend book signings, and more for very cheap or even free.","completion":"To woo a Capricorn woman, engage in ambitious conversations, subtly share accomplishments, plan friendly competitive dates, give practical gifts, and enjoy high-class outings occasionally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Homogenic is the third international solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on One Little Indian Records. The music of \\"Homogenic\\" was a new style for Björk, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. \\"Homogenic\\" was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain. \\"Homogenic\\" marked the first of several production collaborations between Björk and Mark Bell, whom Björk would cite as a major influence on her musical career.

Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean.

Everyone seemed to enjoy talking about other people and their lives. I also didn't like the fact that people seemed very close-minded. I felt trapped. I felt like I was missing out on opportunities.

However, when I arrived in the Big Apple, it wasn't at all what I had imagined. I knew it was home to thousands of people, but I hadn't had the least expectation to see so many people on the street at one time. All the streets were filled with people. I also felt a little surprised to see that everyone was in a hurry and everything moved at such a fast pace.

Article: Media ‘Megyn Kelly Today’ Ratings Not All Sunshine for NBC’s New Morning Host Image Megyn Kelly drew 2.9 million viewers on her first day as host of the 9 a.m. hour of NBC’s “Today” show. By the end of her first week, the number had fallen to 2.3 million. Credit Chad Batka for The New York Times Megyn Kelly, the new host of the 9 a.m. hour of NBC’s “Today” show, is off to a soft start in the ratings. In her first week as a cheerful morning personality, Ms. Kelly, a former Fox News anchor, drew an average of 2.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen, with 765,000 of them in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic prized by advertisers and network executives. The total audience for “Megyn Kelly Today,” Ms. Kelly’s portion of the show, was roughly in line with what “Today” was reaching in the same hour before making the change, when it was hosted by Al Roker, Dylan Dreyer and Sheinelle Jones. In the coveted age bracket, the show’s audience for Ms. Kelly was 5 percent smaller than it was the previous week. NBC hired Ms. Kelly, 46, in January. She had spent 12 years as part of the 21st Century Fox family and was a popular figure among the cable network’s conservative viewers. In an effort to keep her from leaving, Fox reportedly offered her an annual salary of 20 million, but to no avail. Ms. Kelly’s first “Today” hour, which featured as its main guests the cast of the rebooted NBC sitcom “Will & Grace,” had an audience of 2.9 million viewers. The next day, 2.6 million viewers tuned in. By week’s end, the number had fallen to 2.3 million. With its host reportedly making a salary of 17 million a year and a new set having been constructed within NBC’s Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, “Megyn Kelly Today” is more costly than the previous 9 a.m. segment of “Today.” Losing viewers, in the long run, would be a problem. Ms. Kelly’s first week was highly scrutinized, and the early reviews for the show were brutal. She addressed them at the end of her hour on Sept. 29, saying, “It’s been very exciting, it’s been so educational, I’ve been just so delighted by the media response, which is really” — she shook her head before continuing — “no.” After a breath, she added, “The viewer response has been awesome!” As Ms. Kelly moved away from the sometimes prosecutorial persona she inhabited during much of her tenure at Fox, there were a few bumpy moments. The “Will & Grace” star Debra Messing said after appearing on the show that she regretted having done so. Jane Fonda blanched when Ms. Kelly asked her to talk about plastic surgery procedures she has had. And a vulgarity uttered by a cameraman who inadvertently walked into a shot went viral. Another awkward moment came on Oct. 3, two days after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, when Ms. Kelly cut off Tom Brokaw, the former longtime NBC anchor and network eminence, as he went into a lengthy discourse on gun rights and the National Rifle Association. “Got it,” Ms. Kelly said, adding that she had to “leave it at that, Tom,” before shifting to a commercial break. (Mr. Brokaw later told The Washington Post that he was having problems with his hearing aid. “I’m a Kelly fan,” he added.) Ms. Kelly has said that the show would be a mix of a talk show and a news show, and it has moved in both directions, from typical morning fare — celebrity interviews, a segment involving an adorable crime-fighting dog — to gritty discussions of the O. J. Simpson and Menendez brothers cases. NBC has said from the start that it would be patient with the show. Andrew Lack, the network’s news chairman, told affiliates months ago that he did not expect things to be “perfect” with both of Ms. Kelly’s new programs — she also hosts a Sunday evening show, which is on hiatus — in the early going. At least for now, it appears that Ms. Kelly’s main competitor, ABC’s “Live with Kelly and Ryan,” will maintain a lead in the ratings. In the top 56 media markets, “Live” beat “Megyn Kelly Today” by 21 percent in households last week, according to Nielsen. Exact audience figures for last week’s episodes of “Live,” a syndicated show featuring Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, will not be available until next week. It averaged an 2.8 million viewers in the week before Ms. Kelly’s debut, with 915,000 in the 25-to-54 age range. For Ms. Kelly and NBC executives, there was one hopeful nugget buried in the Nielsen data: The number of viewers in the 25-to-54 demographic was 755,000 on Sept. 29, after having fallen to roughly 649,000 the day before.

She tells the live studio audience “I’m kind of done with politics for now,” talks about her family and describes events that have shaped her. NBC News’ Megyn Kelly TODAY Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly prepares for her morning debut on NBC's 'Megyn Kelly Today.' (Photo: Peter Kramer, NBC) Megyn Kelly called her new morning show a work in progress, but she may need to show marked improvement to justify her NBC price tag. The former Fox News anchor's Megyn Kelly Today, which premiered Sept. 25, averaged 2.5 million viewers for her first full week, according to Nielsen estimates. That's down 12% from results for Today's 9 a.m. ET/PT hour in the same week last year, in the midst of the election campaign — when Al Roker, Tamron Hall and Billy Bush were anchoring — and down a steep 24% among core news viewers ages 25 to 54. The good news: After starting with 2.9 million on Monday and dipping to 2.3 million by Wednesday, she leveled off there for the remainder of the week. More: 'Megyn Kelly Today': 'It's not going to be the Trump channel,' she promises Premiere-week ratings for the syndicated Live with Kelly and Ryan, which airs opposite Megyn on many ABC stations, are not yet available. But Megyn Kelly Today's lead-in, the 8 a.m. hour of Today, was off a smaller 8%, to 3.7 million, ranking second to ABC's Good Morning America (also down), after tying it in the same week last year. And Today's 10 a.m. hour, starring Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb, was down 7%, to 1.8 million. NBC will be hard-pressed to justify Kelly's estimated 17 million salary when her lesser-paid predecessors had more viewers, and her summer magazine series regularly ranked third in its time slot behind repeats of 60 Minutes and America's Funniest Videos. But NBC News president Noah Oppenheim told USA TODAY, before the morning show premiered, that he'd exhibit patience: \\"Launching a TV show is a hard thing to do, and we're certainly not naïve about that.\\" Critics pounced on what they called Kelly's missteps in her first days on the air. 'Will & Grace' star Debra Messing, center, says she was \\"dismayed\\" by a question host Megyn Kelly asked a gay fan of the show. (Photo: Nathan Congleton/NBC) She cheerily told a Will & Grace fan on Monday's premiere that \\"the gay thing is going to work out great\\" for him, leading the NBC comedy's star Debra Messing to later say she regretted agreeing to appear on the show with her castmates. On Wednesday, Kelly asked Jane Fonda about her plastic surgery, as the flummoxed 79-year-old actress, sitting next to Robert Redford, said, \\"We really want to talk about that now?\\" And this week, she generated more headlines after she cut off Tom Brokaw mid-sentence during his impassioned speech about the National Rifle Association, in a panel discussion that followed the Las Vegas gun massacre, blaming a \\"hard break\\" for a commercial. Critics also took issue with her transformation from a sharp-elbowed interviewer on Fox News' The Kelly File — where she frequently echoed right-wing talking points about gay marriage and other social issues — to her new role as a warm, touchy-feely morning-show host, for which empathy is part of the job description. In an earlier interview with USA TODAY, Kelly said she's not a fan of politics and has long wanted to do the type of show she has now. She also said she isn't concerned about the weak track record of daytime hosts such as Katie Couric, Meredith Vieira and Jane Pauley after their Today tenures. \\"The more time you spend looking over your shoulder, at your competitor or someone that came prior to you, the more you fail.\\" CLOSE The critics have spoken and Megyn Kelly's debut on 'Today' was super awkward.

Read this: In sheer numbers, Kerry had fewer endorsements than Howard Dean, who was far ahead in the superdelegate race going into the Iowa caucuses in January 2004, although Kerry led the endorsement race in Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico and Nevada. Kerry's main perceived weakness was in his neighboring state of New Hampshire and nearly all national polls. Most other states did not have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for the Kerry campaign before Iowa. Heading into the primaries, Kerry's campaign was largely seen as in trouble, particularly after he fired campaign manager Jim Jordan. The key factors enabling it to survive were when fellow Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy assigned Mary Beth Cahill to be the campaign manager, as well as Kerry's mortgaging his own home to lend the money to his campaign (while his wife was a billionaire, campaign finance rules prohibited using one's personal fortune). He also brought on the \\"magical\\" Michael Whouley who would be credited with helping bring home the Iowa victory the same as he did in New Hampshire for Al Gore in 2000 against Bill Bradley.

While the location of Spittal is clearly stated to be in East Lothian, Scotland, UK, there is no direct mention of the language spoken by its inhabitants. However, considering that Spittal is located within the United Kingdom where English is the predominant language, one could make an educated assumption that English is likely spoken in the village. Scotland, as a part of the UK, has English as its official language, although there are also Scottish Gaelic and Scots languages spoken by some proportion of the population. In conclusion, while there isn't enough information in the text to definitively determine if English is the most likely language spoken in Spittal, it would be reasonable to assume that English is spoken there due to the geographical location and the prevalence of English as the official language in Scotland."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, you can validate this answer, but it's important to note that the exact origins of wine are still debated among experts, and it is difficult to pinpoint one specific country as the origin.

In addition to Greece, other regions, such as modern-day Georgia and Iran, have also been suggested as possible origins for wine production, with archaeological evidence dating back to around 6000-5000 BC. It is essential to recognize that winemaking may have independently developed in different regions around the same time.

Choices: - bus depot - train station - beach - bridge - taxi The rationale to choose \\"train station\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the given choices - Bus depot: A place where buses are stored and maintained. A bum might not necessarily get a free ride, as buses may not be in service. - Train station: A location where trains pick up and drop off passengers. This might be a place where bums can sneak onto a train for a free ride. - Beach: A natural area consisting of sand and water. Bums might not find a free ride here, as it's not a means of transportation. - Bridge: A structure that allows passage over an obstacle, such as water or a road. It is not a place to find a free ride. - Taxi: Taxis usually require payment before or after riding; it's not a likely place for a bum to catch a free ride. Step 2: Eliminate less likely options Remove less likely choices such as beach and bridge, as they don't offer means of transportation. Step 3: Compare the remaining choices We are left with bus depot, train station, and taxi. Buses at the bus depot might not be in service, taxis need payment, while trains at a train station are more likely to be in service and offer opportunities to sneak on for a free ride. Step 4: Select the most likely option Based on the above analysis, a train station seems the most likely place for a bum to find a free ride. In conclusion, the rationale to choose \\"train station\\" as the answer is that it is a location where active transportation is available, and it offers the opportunity for a bum to potentially sneak onto a train for a free ride, while other options either do not provide transportation or require payment in most cases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire to find a way out of trouble. Question: Why don't schools try to encourage creativity? Answer: Answer:","completion":"Schools don't try to encourage creativity because they often focus more on test results and the development of reading, writing, and mathematical skills. Many educators prioritize correct answers and traditional learning methods over creativity, which leads to children being able to regurgitate information but not effectively applying it in new situations or solving practical problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would region B be near or further from a plate boundary? Answer:","completion":"Region B would be further from a plate boundary. Earthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates, which are large pieces of the Earth's crust and upper mantle. These plates interact at their boundaries, causing stress and the release of energy in the form of earthquakes. In Region A, where many earthquakes happen, it is likely close to a plate boundary where tectonic activity is more frequent. In contrast, Region B experiences no earthquakes, which suggests it is further away from a plate boundary, where tectonic activity is minimal or absent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To understand this, we must first define entailment and then analyze the two sentences individually and collectively. Entailment, in the context of linguistics and logic, refers to the relationship between two statements, where if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true. In other words, if statement A entails statement B, then it is logically or necessarily implied that whenever A is true, B is true as well. Now, let's examine the sentences: Sentence 1: \\"Okay, good luck in your car hunting, uh-huh, bye-bye.\\" This sentence conveys a tone of support and well wishes, as the speaker is wishing the recipient of the message good luck in searching for a car. The use of \\"uh-huh\\" and \\"bye-bye\\" makes the sentence informal, but its overall intention is positive. Sentence 2: \\"I hope you will be fleeced in your car deals.\\" This sentence has a completely different tone and intention compared to the first sentence. Here, the speaker expresses a hope for the recipient of the message to be 'fleeced,' meaning to be deceived or cheated, especially in a financial context. This sentiment is clearly negative and malicious, wishing misfortune upon the recipient. Given the differences in tone and intention between the two sentences, there is no logical or necessary implication that if the first sentence is true, the second sentence must also be true. The supportive sentiment of Sentence 1 does not entail the malicious sentiment expressed in Sentence 2. In conclusion, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as the two statements do not share a consistent relationship where the truth of the first statement necessitates the truth of the second statement."},{"prompt":"Combine facts and answer this: Ben Klassen, a self-described white separatist and an American religious leader who founded the Church of the Creator, founded what pantheistic white separatist new religious movement which has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center?

Methodism or the Methodist movement is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant leaders in the movement. It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley's death. The movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States, and beyond because of vigorous missionary work, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide. Wesley's theology focused on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian. Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include an assurance of salvation, imparted righteousness, the possibility of perfection in love, the works of piety, and the primacy of Scripture. Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all; in theology, this view is known as Arminianism. This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people. However, Whitefield and several others were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinistic position. Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the works of mercy. These ideals are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals, orphanages, soup kitchens, and schools to follow Christ's command to spread the gospel and serve all people.

Ever since their college days, the two friends had shared a passion for creative storytelling and had always dreamt of collaborating on a project that would captivate the imaginations of readers worldwide. With Dennis' impressive background in literature and Brett's exceptional skills in crafting believable characters and twisty plots, the duo seemed like an unstoppable force in the literary world. As they embarked on their journey to create a modern day mystery, they agreed to infuse the story with elements that would resonate with contemporary audiences while paying homage to the great detective novels of the past. Their aim was to not only entertain their readers, but to also challenge and inspire them with thought-provoking themes and multidimensional characters. The novel, titled \\"Echoes in the Shadows,\\" would center on a renowned but reclusive detective named Edward Marlowe, who is jolted out of his self-imposed retirement to help solve a series of bizarre and seemingly unconnected murders that have been plaguing the city of Newbridge for months. A mysterious figure, known only as The Composer, has been leaving a trail of dead bodies, each accompanied by a cryptic note filled with literary and musical references. To assist Marlowe in his investigation, Dennis and Brett developed a strong supporting cast, including a tenacious and resourceful rookie cop named Lila Martinez, and an enigmatic author turned amateur sleuth named Oliver Hamilton, who possesses an uncanny knack for connecting the dots and anticipating the killer's moves. Along the way, the trio would form an uneasy alliance, as they all have their unique motivations for wanting to unmask The Composer. As they delved deeper into the case, they uncovered dark secrets hidden within the city's darkest corners, paving the way for shocking revelations and unexpected twists. Through their shared passion for solving the case, the main characters would also confront their own personal demons, resulting in a journey of self-discovery and an understanding that the path to the truth is sometimes paved with moral ambiguity. Throughout the writing process, Brett and Dennis meticulously researched modern crime-solving techniques, using cutting-edge technology and forensic science to add a layer of authenticity to the story. They also studied the works of legendary mystery authors like Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Raymond Chandler, incorporating elements from these masters to create a wholly unique and refreshing spin on the classic detective tale. \\"Echoes in the Shadows\\" would ultimately become a critical and commercial success, thanks in large part to the creative synergy between Brett and Dennis. The duo remained committed to the project, pooling their unique skillsets and talents to create a thrilling, emotionally rich mystery that stayed true to their original vision.

The sunken place contained buildings similar to the new floor buildings of West Stow in England .","completion":"While the two sentences convey a similar idea, there are slight differences in their meanings largely due to the different words used to describe the location, namely \\"site\\" and \\"place.\\" 1. The sunken site contained buildings similar to the new floor buildings of West Stow in England. 2. The sunken place contained buildings similar to the new floor buildings of West Stow in England. In the first sentence, the word \\"site\\" refers to a specific area or piece of land, suggesting that there is an identifiable location with a geological or archaeological significance. When using the term \\"site,\\" it indicates a more formal context and implies that there has likely been some form of exploration or excavation carried out at this location. Furthermore, it suggests that professionals, like archaeologists or historians, have been involved in studying this particular area and its contents. In comparison, the second sentence uses the word \\"place,\\" which is a more general term for a location. Unlike \\"site,\\" \\"place\\" does not necessarily imply any specific geological or archaeological qualities. It tends to lean towards a more casual context and does not immediately suggest any professional study or intervention. By using \\"place,\\" the sentence becomes less precise, as it merely describes a general area. In summary, although both sentences are alike in that they refer to a sunken location with buildings similar to those at West Stow in England, there is a slight difference in the level of specificity and context suggested by the terms \\"site\\" and \\"place.\\" The first sentence (with \\"site\\") likely indicates an area with a well-defined archaeological or geological significance, while the second sentence (with \\"place\\") is more general and informal in its description of the location."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what track and field event for me? Suggested answer: Track and field events are generally individual sports with athletes challenging each other to decide a single victor. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, you should validate this answer as it provides a general understanding of track and field events. However, it can be made more comprehensive by discussing the various types of events within track and field and offering guidance on how one might choose the best event for themselves. Here is a more detailed and long answer to help you with the validation process: Track and field is a diverse sport that encompasses various individual competitions, including running, jumping, and throwing events. Athletes challenge each other to determine a single victor based on their performance in the chosen event. Choosing the right track and field event depends on an individual's athletic abilities, preferences, and goals. 1. Running events: These competitions involve running various distances on a track or cross-country course. Running events in track and field are known as sprints, middle distance, long-distance, and relays. a. Sprints - These short, fast races typically include the 100m, 200m, and 400m. Sprinters should have excellent speed, strength, and explosive power. b. Middle-distance - These races, such as the 800m, 1500m, and 3000m, require a balance of speed and endurance. Middle-distance runners should have good aerobic and anaerobic fitness levels. c. Long-distance - These events extend beyond 3000m, including 5000m, 10000m, and marathon races. Long-distance runners should possess strong endurance levels and mental fortitude. d. Relays - Relay races involve teams of runners, each of whom completes a specific portion of the race before passing the baton to the next teammate. Relay events require teamwork, speed, and efficient baton passing. 2. Jumping events: Jumping events test an athlete's ability to propel themselves into the air, aiming for height or distance. Some common jumping events include: a. Long jump - A horizontal leap into a sand-filled pit, with the top of the running board acting as the takeoff point. b. Triple jump - A combination of three leaps: a hop, a step, and a jump. This event demands strength, coordination, and explosiveness. c. High jump - An event where athletes must clear a horizontal crossbar by jumping over it without knocking it off its supports. d. Pole vault - Athletes propel themselves over a high crossbar using a long, flexible pole. 3. Throwing events: In these events, athletes throw various objects to achieve the greatest distance. The main throwing events include: a. Shot put - Competitors throw a heavy metal ball using a pushing motion from the neck. b. Discus throw - Participants throw a round disc by spinning and releasing it from the palm of their hand. c. Javelin throw - Throwing a long, spear-like object with an overhand motion. d. Hammer throw - Participants spin in a circle while holding onto a wire attached to a heavy ball before releasing it for distance. To identify the right event, individuals should consider their physical attributes, such as speed, strength, endurance, and agility, and their personal interests. It is advised to try several events and consult with experienced coaches to help determine which event best aligns with their abilities and goals. In conclusion, the suggested answer provides an accurate overview of track and field events.

Of this group, the focus is on Jack Kelley (Christian Bale),who one day dreams of heading out west to the wide-open spaces of Santa Fe.One day, Jack meets Les Jacobs (Luke Edwards) and David Jacobs (David Moscow), two brothers who've turned to selling newspapers to support their family, after their father was fired when a machine accident left him unable to work. Jack soon teaches Les and Jacobs some interesting lessons about how to sell papers (such as sensationalizing headlines).Shortly afterwards, the boys are challenged when the 'World' newspaper's owner, Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall), raises their purchase rate by 1/10 of a cent. Though seemingly a drop in the bucket for Pulitzer (who hopes to use the added funds to keep competing with his closest competitor, William Randolph Hearst), the increase is a significant price gouge for the Newsies. With David supplying input and ideas, Jack becomes the leader of the group. The boys then go to other parts of New York to rally other newsboy groups, with Jack and David going to Brooklyn to recruit Spot Conlon (Gabriel Damon) and his group. Even with David's enthusiasm, Spot is still doubtul about joining them.At the same time, the boys catch the eye of Bryan Denton (Bill Pullman), a reporter for the 'New York Sun.' Denton soon becomes the boy's champion, making the 'Sun' the only newspaper in New York covering the newsboy strike.In one incident that gets Pulitzer's attention, the boys cause havoc at a newspaper distribution center, that calls the police to the scene. One of the newsboys, Crutchy (Marty Belafsky), is captured and taken to a place called 'The Refuge,' which is operated by Warden Snyder (Kevin Tighe). While told to be a place to rehabilitate young boys, it is actually a place where its keepers take advantage of the system, pocketing extra money for every boy they bring in, as well as not allowing the boys to partake in more nourishing food.

Q:Question: What could happen when beginning work after it is too late? Options: - panic - deadlines - accomplishing - momentum - sitting down Explain why a human would choose \\"panic\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"When beginning work after it is too late, a human might choose \\"panic\\" as the answer to describe the resulting emotions and state of mind they would experience, and there are several reasons why. 1. Time pressures: When starting work at a later time than initially planned, the individual will likely face increased time pressures and a reduced timeframe within which to complete the task. This can lead to a sense of panic as the individual feels the need to rush to complete the work, and may be overwhelmed by the looming deadline. 2. Decreased quality: Beginning work too late might result in compromises in the quality of work produced. As time becomes a limiting factor, individuals might panic because they can no longer devote ample attention to detail, thorough research, or thoughtful analysis. In turn, they may start doubting themselves and their ability to satisfactorily complete the project, increasing their anxiety. 3. Higher stress levels: Starting work too late can create a stressful situation, and for those with a propensity for anxiety, this can easily escalate into full-blown panic. The mental and emotional strain associated with trying to catch up on lost time can make it difficult for an individual to maintain a calm and composed state of mind. 4. Fear of consequences: The consequences of submitting work late or not being able to complete it within the expected timeframe can be severe. Depending on the importance of the task, potential consequences might include damage to one's reputation, strained relationships with colleagues or supervisors, or even job loss. These high stakes can make someone more prone to experiencing panic in the face of impending deadlines. 5. Interruption of momentum: The act of sitting down late to start work can disrupt the individual's workflow and negatively impact their momentum. As they scramble to immerse themselves in the task at hand, they may find their concentration hampered by panic, stress, and the constant awareness of how behind they are compared to their initial plans. In conclusion, when beginning work after it is too late, the natural response for many humans is panic. This feeling originates from the sudden time pressure, decreased work quality, heightened stress levels, fear of consequences, and interruption of momentum. In such cases, panic serves as a manifestation of the individual's worry and anxiety about their ability to manage and complete the task at hand."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised 4,000 (108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \\"God gave me money\\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \\"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\\" At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from .35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water. In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \\"The Flats\\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed. While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost 2.50 each ended up only .96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself. In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \\"critical\\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for 72,500 (equivalent to 1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \\"It was the day that determined my career.\\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry.

Before engines produce carbon dioxide and living things produce waste, there are specific human activities and natural processes that generate these emissions and contribute to the greenhouse effect. The first step can be described as follows: A: Human activities and natural processes generate greenhouse gas emissions. This step comprises various activities, both anthropogenic (human-induced) and natural, that increase the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Some major contributors include: 1. Burning of fossil fuels: This is the primary source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity generation, transportation, and industrial processes releases large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. 2. Deforestation: The cutting and burning of forests releases stored carbon dioxide, while also reducing the ability of forests to absorb CO2 through photosynthesis. Deforestation is responsible for up to 20% of global CO2 emissions. 3. Agriculture: Livestock farming produces significant amounts of methane, mainly through enteric fermentation in the digestive systems of ruminants like cows and sheep. Nitrous oxide, another potent greenhouse gas, is released from agricultural soils due to the use of synthetic fertilizers and the decomposition of animal waste. 4. Industrial processes: Various industries emit greenhouse gases through chemical reactions, such as the production of cement, steel, and aluminum. These processes can release CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gases. 5. Natural processes: Greenhouse gases are also produced by various natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and the Earth's own carbon cycle. While these processes contribute to the overall greenhouse effect, human activities have significantly increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. By understanding the sources and processes that generate greenhouse gas emissions, we can better understand the subsequent steps in the process you identified, including the production of carbon dioxide by engines, the decomposition of waste, and the resulting contributions to the atmospheric greenhouse effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A group of four boys walk up to Bleek Gilliam's brownstone and ask him to come out and play baseball with them. Bleek's mother insists that he continue his trumpet lesson, to his chagrin. His father becomes concerned that Bleek will grow up to be a sissy, and a family argument ensues. In the end, Bleek continues playing his trumpet, and his friends go away. The next scene brings us to the present (over twenty years later), with an adult Bleek (Denzel Washington) performing on the trumpet at a busy nightclub with his jazz band, The Bleek Quintet (Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts, Wesley Snipes, Giancarlo Esposito and Bill Nunn). Giant (Spike Lee, one of his boyhood friends from the previous scene and current manager of Bleek's band), is waiting in the wings, and advises him to stop allowing his saxophone player Shadow Henderson (Snipes) to grandstand with long solos. The next morning Bleek wakes up with his girlfriend, Indigo Downes (Joie Lee). She leaves to go to class, while he meets his father by the Brooklyn Bridge for a game of catch, telling him that while he does like Indigo, he likes other women too and is not ready to make a commitment. Later in the day while he is practicing his trumpet, another woman named Clarke Bentancourt (Cynda Williams) visits him. She suggests he fire Giant as his manager; he suggests that they make love (which he refers to as \\"moâ better\\").

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Recognize the warning signs. Re-establish safety. Contact the authorities.","completion":"Title: The Importance of Recognizing Warning Signs, Re-establishing Safety, and Contacting Authorities Introduction Safety is not something to be taken for granted. It is our responsibility to recognize warning signs, re-establish safety, and contact the authorities when necessary. When we observe any potential risks, it is crucial to be vigilant and act accordingly to prevent harm to ourselves and others. This article aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the importance of recognizing warning signs, re-establishing safety, and contacting authorities when necessary. By cultivating mindfulness and awareness, we can contribute to a more secure society. Section 1: Recognizing Warning Signs Warning signs can come in various forms - physical, emotional, social, or even environmental. It is essential to be aware of these indicators to mitigate risks and maintain a safe environment. Some warning signs to look out for include: 1. Physical signs: Unusual objects, abandoned bags, or suspicious individuals lurking around can serve as a warning of a possible threat. It is essential to keep a keen eye on anything out of the ordinary. 2. Emotional signs: If you or someone you know exhibits signs of distress, anxiety, or fear, it might be indicative of an unsafe situation. 3. Social signs: A sudden change in social behavior or avoidance of certain people, places, or events can also be warning signs. Stay alert to any significant deviations from the norm. 4. Environmental signs: Unusual weather conditions, structural damages, or hazardous materials can pose potential safety threats. It is crucial to be aware of one's surroundings and act accordingly. Section 2: Re-establishing Safety Once warning signs are recognized, it is essential to act quickly to re-establish safety by doing the following: 1. Remove yourself or others from danger: If an immediate physical threat exists, move away from the area or advise those affected to do the same. This may involve evacuating a building, leaving a gathering, or seeking shelter. 2. Communicate concerns: Share your observations regarding any warning signs with someone you trust, like a friend, family member or co-worker. Sharing your concerns can create a collective awareness to address potential dangers. 3. Support your emotions: Recognize your emotions and seek support from loved ones, counseling services, or support groups. If you are affected by the situation, addressing your emotional needs is an essential aspect of re-establishing safety. 4. Implement changes: Address the situation by implementing changes that can improve safety. This may involve setting boundaries, creating safety plans, or securing your environment. Section 3: Contacting the Authorities Contacting authorities is crucial in certain situations to ensure the proper response and resources are deployed. When calling the authorities: 1. Be specific about the situation: Provide detailed information about the incident, including a description of warning signs, people involved, location, and any other necessary details for the authorities to assess the situation correctly. 2. Maintain composure: Despite the possible urgency and anxiety of the situation, speak calmly and clearly to improve communication with the authorities. 3. Follow instructions: Listen attentively to the instructions provided by the authorities and follow them accordingly. They are trained professionals who are equipped to handle a wide range of situations. 4. Cooperate with the investigation: Be prepared to provide any additional information or assistance that the authorities may require. Your cooperation will help to expedite the resolution of the situation. Conclusion: In an increasingly complex and unpredictable world, it is more important than ever to recognize warning signs, re-establish safety, and contact the authorities when necessary. By fostering a culture of proactivity and vigilance, we can ensure that our homes, workplaces, and communities remain safe for all. Staying alert, communicating concerns, and seeking support can make a significant difference in preventing potential harm and maintaining a secure environment for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which parent had more cholesterol deposits on the arterial wall? Bob's parents were in their early 60's. He sent them to the doctor's for a routine check up. Dan, his dad, had very high cholesterol, while Mary, his mom , had normal levels in her blood. Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph, Bob's dad, Dan, had more cholesterol deposits on the arterial wall.

John offers few advice.","completion":"To determine whether the sentence \\"John offers few advice\\" would be considered correct by a linguist, I will analyze it step-by-step: 1. Identify the subject, verb, and object: In this sentence, \\"John\\" is the subject, \\"offers\\" is the verb, and \\"advice\\" is the object. 2. Check for subject-verb agreement: The subject \\"John\\" is singular, and the verb \\"offers\\" is also in the singular form, so they agree. 3. Analyze the object and its modifier: The object \\"advice\\" is an uncountable noun, which means it cannot be counted or used with a singular or plural form (i.e., we cannot say \\"one advice\\" or \\"two advices\\"). The modifier \\"few\\" is used to indicate a small number of countable items (e.g., \\"few suggestions\\" or \\"few friends\\"). 4. Assess the compatibility of the modifier and the object: Since \\"few\\" is used for countable nouns and \\"advice\\" is uncountable, they are not compatible in this sentence. Based on this analysis, a linguist would consider the sentence \\"John offers few advice\\" incorrect by the strictest standards. A more appropriate alternative can be either \\"John offers little advice\\" (using \\"little\\" as the uncountable modifier) or \\"John offers a few pieces of advice\\" (using \\"a few\\" and \\"pieces\\" to make the expression countable)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Work and Pensions Secretary. accused Labour and the BBC of fuelling a ‘stunt’ after he suggested in a. radio interview that if necessary, he could get by on the amount a. benefit claimant said he had to subsist on. An online petition calling on Mr. Duncan Smith to live for a year on £53 a week, which has been seized on. by Labour MPs opposing cuts to the vast welfare budget, had last night. attracted almost 300,000 signatures. Iain Duncan Smith, seen here with his wife Betsy, insists he has lived on the breadline before. Back at work: David Bennett leaving home in Hunwick, County Durham, yesterday. But the minister insisted yesterday. that the Left had ‘lost the argument’ on reform of a welfare state that. kept people ‘trapped into dependency’ and was now trying to ‘set up a. stunt’. He said he would not agree to the. demands to show he could exist on the same income as market trader David. Bennett because he had ‘been there, done that’. ‘I’m not going take any lectures from. these people because the Left has opposed everything that we’ve done,’ Mr Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail. ‘What’s going on here is a campaign. by the Left to distract from the reality of our changes. My personal. details are quite simple. When I came out of the Army I was unemployed. I. lived in a bedsit and I had to look for work. ‘I left the Army at 26, 27. I went off. and did a heavy goods vehicle drivers’ course. I know what it’s like to. live on a low income. ‘I didn’t claim unemployment benefit –. I lived off the savings I had – but I went to the job centre. Later on. in life when I worked my way up I was made redundant, I again had to. start all over again from scratch and this time I had kids. I didn’t. have any financial backing and I had to pick up the pieces, find another. job and get back to work. ‘The honest truth is I don’t need any. lessons from these people. I have worked hard all my life for what I’ve. achieved and nobody has given me a damn penny. My earnings are what I. live on.’ Mr Duncan Smith, who earns £134,000 a. year and lives in a £2million Tudor country house with wife Betsy, a. member of the aristocratic Fremantle family, said he had lost his job at. a property company when interest rates soared after Black Wednesday in. 1992. David Bennett, working on his market stall yesterday, challenged Iain Duncan Smith to live on £53 a week. ‘The company literally stopped working. and like a number of people I was made redundant. I was shocked, but I. had to go home and tell my wife that the wheels had come off the bus,’ he said. ‘It took about three months to find a. job. I picked up the paper every day, put a ring round all the job ads. I. went to the library, looked up the stock market yearbook, wrote blind. letters to people, used my Amstrad computer every day to look for work. Every bloody day I had to look for work. One of those blind letters got. me in to an interview. ‘So I don’t need any lessons from. people about living on a low income and making ends meet. I have done it. twice and I know what it’s like to have to been made unemployed and to. struggle. I’ve been there, done it. ‘I have never taken anything from. anybody else. I’m proud enough to believe I get on and make my own. bloody way in the world. I don’t believe in having anyone else do it for. me. ‘That’s why I want to reform the. system because it leaves people feeling helpless. This ridiculous. nonsense is a stunt, and it’s a stunt to avoid the reality that we. inherited a bust system – financially bust and morally bust.’ The Mail revealed yesterday that Mr. Bennett, who challenged Mr Duncan Smith to live on £53 a week, is a. regular gambler who lists his hobbies as ‘football, poker and beer’. Challenge: Market trader David Bennett, left,. asked Tory minister Iain Duncan Smith, right, if he could survive on the. new housing benefit level of £53 in a charged interview on Radio 4. Iain Duncan-Smith's Buckinghamshire home. He is paid £1,581 a week but said he cwould be able to live on £7.57 per day if he had to. Tory MPs were furious the BBC allowed. him to confront the Work and Pensions Secretary apparently without. making the most cursory checks on his income, which is nearer £150 a. week. Conservative MP for Esher, Dominic. Raab, wrote to new BBC director-general Lord Hall, saying he was. concerned that the interview with Mr Bennett not only lacked accuracy. but ‘may well have failed in its duty of care towards Mr Bennett’. ‘What background checks were made by. the BBC to ensure the veracity of Mr Bennett’s claims?’ he asked. ‘Mr. Bennett claims that he “put a comment on [the BBC website] saying David. Cameron can stick his Big Society where the sun doesn’t shine”. Why did. the BBC not take this as an indication that his claims merited deeper. examination? ‘The BBC has persistently used highly politicised and partisan language in its coverage of the Government’s welfare reforms.’ Chancellor George Osborne said. yesterday: ‘I don’t think it’s sensible to reduce this debate to an. argument about one individual’s set of circumstances. ‘We have a welfare system where there. are actually lots of benefits available to people on very low incomes,. there’s jobseeker’s allowance, income support, working tax credit,. council tax benefit, housing benefit, if they have children, child tax. credit. ‘What this debate is about, it’s not. about any individual, it’s about creating a welfare system that rewards. work, supports people who do the right thing, helps people who want to. get on in life and has a regard for the many millions of people who work. hard and pay their taxes and expect them to be well spent.’ Mr Duncan Smith once stayed on a tough housing estate for a Channel 4 documentary.

Try an exfoliating body scrub in the shower and a deep pore cleansing clay mask for your face and neck. Be sure to moisturize! If you don’t have a body scrub, try mixing brown sugar with any body lotion for a homemade exfoliant. Apply to your skin in a circular motion and then rinse off in a warm shower. Be sure to exfoliate 24 hours before the beach to give your body time to recover from potential inflammation. Getting a wax or shaving at home will eliminate body hair to get you looking great in a bikini. If shaving at home, be sure to lather up on shaving cream and use a good, 3-4-blade razor to avoid unsightly cuts or razor burn. For those opting for a wax, be sure to book an appointment a few days before you hit the beach to give inflammation time to heal. Use sunscreen all over your body and face to avoid a burn. Sun damage also can cause wrinkles, so it’s important to lather up even if you’re working on a tan. Look for moisturizers, make up, and lip balm with a little added SPF to get some extra protection. Sweat and dirt in your pores can easily turn into unwanted pimples and blackheads. If you struggle from body or facial acne, use a body wash that contains salicylic acid to maintain blemish free skin. This should be applied after you moisturize. It usually takes between 5-7 days for skin to peak, so plan accordingly. There’s no need to use a self-tanner, but many find it boosts confidence in the early beach season when skin is still lighter from winter. Remember, pale skin is beautiful too!

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the last names of the two individuals who were convinced to purchase Spring Ice?, using the article: In March 1916, Thomson exhibited four canvases with the OSA: In the Northland (at that time titled The Birches), Spring Ice, Moonlight and October (then titled The Hardwoods), all of which were painted over the winter of 1915–16. Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the National Gallery of Canada wanted to purchase In the Northland, but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to purchase Spring Ice instead. The reception of Thomson's paintings at this time was mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the Toronto Daily Star wrote, \\"Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper.\\" A more favourable take came from artist Wyly Grier in The Christian Science Monitor: Tom Thomson again reveals his capacity to be modern and remain individual. His early pictures—in which the quality of naivete had all the genuineness of the effort of the tyro and was not the counterfeit of it which is so much in evidence in the intensely rejuvenated works of the highly sophisticated—showed the faculty for affectionate and truthful record by a receptive eye and faithful hand; but his work today has reached higher levels of technical accomplishment. His Moonlight, Spring Ice and The Birches are among his best. In The Canadian Courier, painter Estelle Kerr also spoke positively, describing Thomson as \\"one of the most promising of Canadian painters who follows the impressionist movement and his work reveals himself to be a fine colourist, a clever technician, and a truthful interpreter of the north land in its various aspects\\".In 1916, Thomson left for Algonquin Park earlier than any previous year, evidenced by the many snow studies he produced at this time. In April or early May, MacCallum, Harris and his cousin Chester Harris joined Thomson at Cauchon Lake for a canoe trip. After MacCallum and Chester left,..., what would be the answer ?

Effect on cotton production and expansion of slavery Cheap cotton textiles increased the demand for raw cotton; previously, it had primarily been consumed in subtropical regions where it was grown, with little raw cotton available for export. Consequently, prices of raw cotton rose. Some cotton had been grown in the West Indies, particularly in Hispaniola, but Haitian cotton production was halted by the Haitian Revolution in 1791. The invention of the cotton gin in 1792 allowed Georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable, leading to the widespread growth of cotton plantations in the United States and Brazil. In 1791 world cotton production was estimated to be 490,000,000 pounds with U.S. production accounting to 2,000,000 pounds. By 1800 U.S. production was 35,000,000 pounds, of which 17,790,000 were exported. In 1945 the U.S. produced seven-eights of the 1,169,600,000 pounds of world production. Answer this question: How many more pounds did U.S. cotton production increase in 1800 from 1791?","completion":"Okay kiddo, let's talk about cotton production. In 1791, the United States made 2,000,000 pounds of cotton. But in 1800, they made 35,000,000 pounds of cotton. So, to find out how many more pounds of cotton were produced in 1800 compared to 1791, we can subtract the smaller number (2,000,000) from the bigger number (35,000,000). Here's the math: 35,000,000 (the cotton production in 1800) - 2,000,000 (the cotton production in 1791) = 33,000,000 So, the United States made 33,000,000 more pounds of cotton in 1800 than they did in 1791. That's a lot of cotton!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Process: - Coal is burned in a boiler - Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins - Creates electricity. Question: suppose there will be less pressure happens, how will it affect MORE electricity being produced. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"B: less When there is less pressure in the system, it will negatively affect the electricity production. Here's a detailed explanation of why this occurs: 1. Coal is burned in a boiler: In the first phase of the process, coal is burned in a boiler. The burning of coal releases heat, which is further used to heat water within the boiler. When the water absorbs enough heat, it turns into steam. 2. Steam is produced under pressure: The steam produced inside the boiler is maintained under high pressure. This pressure allows the steam to carry a significant amount of energy, which is essential for the next phases of the power generation process. 3. Steam flows into a turbine: The high-pressure steam created in the boiler flows into a turbine. The turbine holds a series of blades that are specifically designed to capture the energy from the steam and convert it into mechanical energy. The steam's energy causes the turbine blades to rotate, turning the turbine at high speeds. 4. The turbine spins: The spinning of the turbine generates the mechanical energy that is required to turn the generator, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. 5. Creates electricity: With the help of a generator, the mechanical energy obtained from the spinning turbine is converted into electricity, which can then be distributed to consumers via electrical grids. Now, let's assume that there is less pressure in the system. When the steam produced in the boiler is not under sufficient pressure, it carries less energy than it would under ideal conditions. Steam with lower energy will be less effective at causing the turbine blades to rotate, which in turn will result in less mechanical energy being generated. Consequently, the generator will produce a lower amount of electrical energy. In summary, if there is less pressure in the system, the entire process of electricity generation becomes less efficient, resulting in less electricity being produced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Algeria is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia, to the east by Libya, to the west by Morocco, to the southwest by the Western Saharan territory, Mauritania, and Mali, to the southeast by Niger, and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. The country is a semi-presidential republic consisting of 48 provinces and 1,541 communes (counties). Abdelaziz Bouteflika has been President since 1999. - Ahmed Ouyahia (born 2 July 1952) is an Algerian politician who was Prime Minister of Algeria from 1995 to 1998, from 2003 to 2006, and from 2008 to 2012. A career diplomat, he also served as the minister of justice, and was one of the founders and former secretary general of the National Rally for Democracy party.

They were followed by the Movement of Society for Peace ( as Hamas had been required to rename itself ) with 69 seats , the FLN ( 62 ) , and the Islamist Ennahda ( 34 ) . The two Berberist parties , FFS and RCD , got 20 and 19 seats respectively .

What is the relationship between 'algerian legislative election' and 'prime minister of algeria'?","completion":"The relationship between the Algerian legislative election and the Prime Minister of Algeria lies in the formation of the government following the results of the legislative elections. In Algeria, the legislative elections are held to elect members of the People's National Assembly (the lower house of the Parliament). Based on the outcomes of these elections, political parties with majority representation or coalitions of parties come together to form a government. Once a coalition or majority party is established, they nominate a candidate for the position of Prime Minister. While the President of Algeria has the authority to appoint the Prime Minister, the choice is generally influenced by the results of the legislative elections and the parties in power. This makes the Algerian legislative elections a significant event in the selection and appointment of the Prime Minister, as the chosen candidate represents the leading political party or coalition in the government.

But six-month-old Emily Scott may not agree - the youngster burst into tears when she met Charles as he continued his visit to Yorkshire. The Prince admitted that he toasted the. birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's child by opening a bottle. of champagne last night - however, he told well-wishers he had 'no idea' what his grandson would be called. Scroll down for video. Better luck with the grandson! The Prince of Wales with a weeping six-month-old, Emily Scott, during his trip to Bugthorpe in Yorkshire today. On duty: The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall continued their scheduled engagements today. Sunshine: The Royal couple enjoyed pleasant weather as they talked to villagers in Bugthorpe. The Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall were met by cheering crowds as the visited an East Yorkshire village. Locals. queued up to congratulate the couple as they walked around the green in. Bugthorpe, which was decked out with Union flags and bunting. Resident Alex Dale told Charles: 'We popped a bottle of bubbly last night at our house - I hope you did too.' The Prince replied: 'Yes. But just a little bit.' He also told locals he was 'thrilled and very excited' by the news that his daughter-in-law had given birth. Happy day: Prince Charles appeared to be in very high spirits the day after his grandson's birth. Anticipation: The Prince told Isla Lister, pictured, that he couldn't wait to meet the new arrival. One member of the crowd, Robert Barrett, raised a chuckle from Charles by greeting him, 'Morning grandad!' Mr Barrett later said, 'He obviously likes being a grandad.' And a little boy asked the Prince: 'When's the little baby coming?' to which Charles replied: 'We haven't been able to bring him yet.' Camilla said her husband would make a 'brilliant' grandfather as she spoke to crowds during the visit. 'I think it's wonderful news. I think mother, son and father are all well,' she told the BBC. Placing an order: The Duchess of Cornwall approaches the counter in a fish and chips restaurant. Meal: The Duchess of Cornwall enjoyed a snack of fish and chips during a visit to Bridlington.

And Isla's grandmother, Judy Willis, said Charles told her: 'Grannies are getting younger, you know.' Camilla later enjoyed a lunch of 'celebration fish and chips' in Bridlington, described the meal as 'the best thing I have eaten in an awfully long time'. She ate the takeaway from the box it came in - but declined an offer of batter 'scraps' on her meal and opted instead for a healthy slice of lemon. However, while she might have enjoyed the experience, she was unwilling to reward the proprietor with a sneak peek at the name of the Royal baby. The Prince also enjoyed a nautical snack, when he was given a portion of Bridlington crab cakes by local chef David Nowell. He. spoke to Holderness Fishing Industry Group about how offshore wind. farms affect the fishing industry, and was offered the chance to hold a. live lobster but politely declined. During. the trip to Bridlington harbour, Geraldine Kynaston asked the Prince if. she could give him a cuddle to congratulate him on becoming a. grandparent.

I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses.

Article: The curtain on the 2008 US presidential election finally rose last month as John McCain and Barack Obama were formally nominated as candidates of the two major parties. This may be one of the hardest decisions voters have to make between two appealing candidates. The big question for voters, as they face both an economic downturn and international threats, is: who will they elect? A young first-term senator promising change and new ideas, or a longtime senator with strong military experience and a reputation as a maverick ? American voters have never seen a candidate quite like Obama. He has a white mother from theprefix = st1 /USand a black father fromKenyawho left the family when Obama was very young. He spent part of his youth inIndonesia. His supporters say Obama's childhood gives him the advantage to repair the recent damage done toAmerica's image abroad. His opponents focus on his inexperience, noting he hasn't finished his first term in the Senate. However, McCain has a very different life story. He grew up in a Navy family and was a pilot during the Vietnam War in the 1960s. When Obama was in kindergarten in Indonesia, McCain's plane was shot down overVietnamand he became a prisoner of war. McCain could have been released if he _ Americabut he refused and so was held for five years. So in the end, the election may hinge on (...) several factors that are hard to judge: Will Obama's race matter to a significant number of voters? Will working-class whites who tended to support his primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, vote for Obama? And perhaps most important of all, will swing voters be more drawn to Obama's vision or to McCain's experience? Whatever happens, one thing is clear: Whoever walks into the White House on January 20, 2009, will find enormous challenges waiting for him in the Oval Office, both at home and abroad. Question: _ makes the result of the election hard to predict. Options: A: Whether working class whites care about Obama's inexperience B: The economic trouble the country now faces C: Who swing voters will finally decide to vote for D: McCain's being too old to govern the country The answer to this question is:","completion":"C: Who swing voters will finally decide to vote for"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who was last seen at an archaeological dig? Two young American couples — Jeff and Amy, and Eric and Stacy — enjoy their vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias, a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri, Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

(D). by eliminating the possibility of accidents.","completion":"To answer this question, let's evaluate each option and its impact on society: (A) Transit systems, like buses, benefit society by reducing the amount of pollution. This is true because public transportation is more energy efficient and can transport more people at once compared to single-occupant vehicles. This reduces the overall number of cars on the road, thus lowering CO2 emissions and air pollution. (B) Transit systems benefit society by increasing the number of car sales. This is not accurate since public transportation tends to reduce the reliance on personal vehicles. People who use public transit regularly are less likely to buy or need a car, so this option does not benefit society. (C) Transit systems benefit society by increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the air. This is incorrect because public transportation is a more environmentally friendly option compared to personal vehicles. By using public transit, people can reduce their carbon footprint and lower CO2 emissions generated from the transportation sector. (D) Transit systems benefit society by eliminating the possibility of accidents. This statement is not entirely accurate.

Each sub-list consists of multiple integers which can be positive, negative or zero. Part #2: Identifying odd numbers in each inner list Usage: A number is considered odd if it's not divisible by 2. For example, in the list [23, -11, -37, -26], 23, -11, and -37 are all odd numbers because when divided by 2 they don't result in an even quotient. Part #3: Multiplication of odd numbers Usage: Once we have found the odd numbers in each list, we multiply them. For instance, in [23, -11, -37, -26], the product of 23, -11, and -37 would be -9383. Part #4: Handling lists with no odd numbers Usage: Some inner lists may not contain any odd numbers, like [8, -20] for instance. For these lists, because there are no odd numbers to multiply, the instruction implies an output of 0 for that list. Part #5: Output format Usage: The output should be a list of integers, with each integer position corresponding to an inner list in the initial input list. For example, for the input [[23, -11, -37, -26], [8, -20]], the multiplication of odd numbers in the first list is -9383 and there are no odd numbers in the second list, so the expected output would be [-9383, 0].

It won the 2002 ARIA Music Award for Best Group and Best Rock Album. The album was co-produced by Daniel Johns and David Bottrill. While Bottrill had worked on albums for a variety of other bands, Diorama marked the first production credit for lead singer Johns. Johns wrote most of the album at the piano instead of his usual guitar, while the band took a 12-month break following their previous studio album, Neon Ballroom. Silverchair worked with composer Van Dyke Parks on Diorama; the album contains numerous orchestral arrangements and power ballads, a change from the post-grunge music typical of their earlier work, but consistent with the band's previous orchestrations on Neon Ballroom. The album's title refers to \\"a world within a world\\". Five singles were released: \\"The Greatest View\\", \\"Without You\\", \\"Luv Your Life\\", \\"Across the Night\\" and \\"After All These Years\\". All except \\"After All These Years\\", a promotional single, appeared on the Australian singles chart. Diorama was successful in the charts but was not as well received by critics as the band's earlier albums. It reached number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart and received a rating of 71 (out of 100) on review aggregator Metacritic. It was certified triple-platinum by ARIA, selling in excess of 210,000 copies, and won five ARIA Awards in 2002.

Please answer the following question: There are stock markets in large cities in many countries. Stock markets in Paris, London, Tokyo, Shanghai and New York are among the largest and most well-known. The stock, also called stock exchange, is a place where people can buy or sell shares of a factory or company. And each share means certain ownership of a factory or company. Different people go to stock markets. Some are rich, who want to get more money than they have. Others are not very rich, who buy stocks to try to become rich. Still others buy stocks as part of their plan to save money. Of course, investing money in the stock market is not the safest way to make money. No one can tell exactly whether the shares will be doing well. The factory or company may do badly. Then the stocks will go down, and the investors will lose money. The stock may go up or down for a number of untold reasons. Everyone wants the stock to go up, but sometimes even if a factory or company does a good job, the stock may still go down. Going to the stock market is often like gambling . All want to make money by \\"gambling' in the stock market. Factories and companies that need money are pleased that so many people are ready to \\"gamble\\". Indeed, the stock market is an attractive but part of the business world. If you are a good investor, _ in the stock market. A) you can always make money B) you can tell exactly when the stock goes up or down C) you may sometimes lose money D) your gambling is always safe Answer:","completion":"C) you may sometimes lose money The stock market is a complex and dynamic environment where people can buy or sell shares of companies. It attracts a diverse range of investors, such as those who are wealthy and want to make more money, those who are not very rich and hope to become wealthy, and those who buy stocks as a way to save money. However, investing in the stock market is not a guaranteed path to making money, as the value of shares can go up or down based on various factors. Factors affecting the stock market can be influenced by a company's performance, economic conditions, geopolitical events, and other unforeseen circumstances. As a result, no one can predict with certainty whether a particular stock will perform well or not. A good investor may do thorough research and make informed decisions, but even then, they may sometimes lose money. Investing in the stock market is often likened to gambling, given the uncertainty involved. Despite the potential risks, many people are drawn to the stock market in hopes of making money. Companies and factories benefit from this interest, as they can raise funds by selling shares to investors willing to take the gamble. In summary, if you are a good investor in the stock market, you can make informed decisions based on research and analysis. However, even with these skills, you may sometimes lose money due to the unpredictable nature of the market. As such, it's crucial to approach stock market investing with a balanced view of the risks and potential rewards involved."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: As if there weren't enough of them in the world already, scientists have succeeded in cloning flies. The alike fruit flies are the first insects ever cloned, says the Canadian team that created them. The question everyone asks is why anyone would want to clone flies in the first place. She hopes that the insects , which are very easy to experiment with , will help to adjust the cloning process in other animals and even in humans, where the technique is being researched to aid production of therapeutic stem cells. In cloning, the DNA-containing nucleus of an adult cell is injected into an egg whose own nucleus has been removed. At the moment, the majority of cloned mice, sheep and other animals die before birth. It is thought this is because the adult DNA is not properly 'reprogrammed'. Using flies, researchers might discover genes that are important for this reprogramming, and that have matches in other animals. That is because it is relatively easy in flies to knock out the function of a single gene and then attempt cloning with these cells, which will test whether that gene is important. If such genes are confirmed, then in theory cloned mammalian embryos might be grown in selected solutions that change the activity of those genes to improve the technique's success rate. Although some groups have attempted to clone insects before, Lloyd says this is the first time it has been successful. The team used a slight difference on the standard cloning process: they transferred nuclei taken from embryos rather than fully-grown adult cells. They sucked several nuclei (pl)out of developing fly embryos, and injected them into a fertilized fly egg. From over 800 early attempts, they cloned five adult insects, the group reports in the journal Genetics. Question: The failure of most cloned animals is due to _ .

When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons.

Choices: - with someone - together - in crowd - many people - confined The rationale to choose \\"with someone\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"\\"with someone\\" The rationale for choosing \\"with someone\\" as the answer lies in an understanding of the various elements present in the question and the context it portrays. Let's analyze the different aspects of the question and how it ties in with the provided options: 1. Emotional state: The sentence states that \\"She felt so alone on campus,\\" which highlights the primary emotion being experienced by the individual – loneliness. Loneliness can manifest in various forms, but it primarily involves a sense of feeling disconnected, isolated, or emotionally distanced from others. 2. Desires: The primary desire expressed in the question is that \\"she just wanted to be.\\" This indicates that the individual is searching for companionship or connection, which can help alleviate her feelings of loneliness. 3. Examining the choices: a. \\"with someone\\": This option directly addresses the individual's primary desire for companionship or connection, as it implies being in the company of another person. Being with someone usually involves sharing experiences, conversations, or feelings that can help reduce feelings of isolation or loneliness. b. \\"together\\": Although this option might seem similar to \\"with someone,\\" it is actually less specific and conveys a more collective sense of unity. While it does suggest the idea of connection, it doesn't necessarily imply direct companionship or a one-on-one connection. c. \\"in crowd\\": This option refers to being part of a larger group, but it does not inherently guarantee the formation of meaningful connections or companionship. In fact, it's possible to be in a crowd of people and still feel lonely due to a lack of personal relationships or interactions. d. \\"many people\\": This choice is similar to \\"in crowd,\\" suggesting the presence of a multitude of people. Despite being around numerous others, it does not directly address the individual's desire for personal connections or companionship that can alleviate her feelings of loneliness. e. \\"confined\\": This option has a generally negative connotation and implies being restricted or limited in some way. It doesn't inherently address the individual's feelings of loneliness or her desire for emotional connections or companionship. Considering the emotional state and desires outlined in the question, the most logical and appropriate answer would be \\"with someone.\\" This choice directly addresses the individual's feelings of loneliness and her desire for companionship that can help alleviate her sense of isolation on campus. The other options, while providing some connection to other people, do not directly cater to the need for companionship or the alleviation of loneliness in the same way that \\"with someone\\" does."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: Callow youth D'Artagnan (Walter Abel) sets off from Gascony for Paris, armed with his father's sword, an old horse and a letter of introduction to his godfather, Captain de Treville (Lumsden Hare), commander of the King's Musketeers. Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer. Then he spots Rochefort on the street. In his haste to confront his enemy, D'Artagnan unintentionally insults three Musketeers: Athos (Paul Lukas), Porthos (Moroni Olsen), and Aramis (Onslow Stevens) in turn, agreeing each time to a duel. When his opponents arrive at the appointed place, they are amused to discover they are all engaged to cross swords with the same man. However, Cardinal Richelieu's Guards try to arrest the Musketeers for dueling. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered trio and acquits himself well. His three new friends secure him free lodging by threatening landlord Bernajou (Murray Kinnell) with an imaginary law and find him a servant named Planchet (John Qualen).

Its origins in Tibet can be traced to early 12th century master Yumo Mikyo Dorje, but became much wider known with the help of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, a monk originally trained in the Sakya school. The Jonang school was widely thought to have become extinct in the late 17th century at the hands of the 5th Dalai Lama, who forcibly annexed the Jonang monasteries to his Gelug school, declaring them heretical. - The Nyingma tradition is the oldest of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism (the other three being the Kagyu, Sakya and Gelug). \\"Nyingma\\" literally means \\"ancient,\\" and is often referred to as Ngangyur (, \\"school of the ancient translations\\" or \\"old school\\") because it is founded on the first translations of Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Old Tibetan in the eighth century. The Tibetan alphabet and grammar was actually created for this endeavour. - The Kagyu, Kagyü, or Kagyud school, also known as the \\"\\"Oral Lineage\\"\\" or \\"Whispered Transmission\\" school, is today regarded as one of six main schools (\\"chos lugs\\") of Himalayan or Tibetan Buddhism, the other five being the Nyingma, Sakya, Jonang, Gelug and Bon. Along with the Sakya and Gelug schools, the Kagyu tradition is classified as one of the Sarma or \\"New Transmission\\" schools of Vajrayna founded during the second diffusion of Buddhism into Tibet (diffusing the so-called \\"New Tantras\\"). It is a Red Hat sect along with the Nyingma and Sakya. - Classical Tibetan refers to the language of any text written in Tibetic after the Old Tibetan period; though it extends from the 7th century until the modern day, it particularly refers to the language of early canonical texts translated from other languages, especially Sanskrit. The phonology implied by Classical Tibetan orthography is basically identical to the phonology of Old Tibetan, but the grammar varies greatly depending on period and geographic origin of the author. Such variation is an under-researched topic. - Bon or Bön is a Tibetan religion, which self-identifies as being distinct from Tibetan Buddhism, although it shares the same overall teachings and terminology. It arose in the eleventh century and established its scriptures mainly from termas and visions by tertöns such as Loden Nyingpo. Though Bon terma contain myths of Bon existing before the introduction of Buddhism in Tibet, \\"in truth the 'old religion' was a new religion.\\" - The Samye Monastery or Samye Gompa (Chinese:) is the first Buddhist monastery built in Tibet. It was probably first constructed between 775-9 CE under the patronage of King Trisong Detsen of Tibet who sought to revitalize Buddhism, which had declined since its introduction by King Songtsän Gampo in the 7th century. The monastery is in Dranang, Lhoka Prefecture. It was supposedly modeled on the design of Odantapuri in what is now Bihar, India. - Tibetan Buddhism is the body of Buddhist doctrine and institutions characteristic of Tibet, the regions surrounding the Himalayas and much of Central Asia. It derives from the latest stages of Indian Buddhism and preserves \\"the Tantric status quo of eighth-century India.\\" Tibetan Buddhism aspires to Buddhahood or rainbow body. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - In Mahayana Buddhism, bodhisattva is the Sanskrit term for anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated bodhicitta, which is a spontaneous wish to attain buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. Bodhisattvas are a popular subject in Buddhist art. - Daklha Gampo ( Dwags lha sgam po ) is a Kagyu monastery founded in 1121 CE by Je Gampopa ( 1079 - 1153 ) , the disciple of the famous and much - loved bodhisattva , Jetsun Milarepa ( c. 1052 -- c. 1135 ) It is located in Gyatsa County in the old district of Dakpo in southern Tibet on land sanctified as a geomantic power - place ( ' head of the ogress ' ) by the first Tibetan emperor , Songtsen Gampo ( 605 or 617 ? - 649 ) , and made a repository of terma by Padmasambhava . - In Buddhism, bodhicitta (\\"putixin\\" \\"bodaishin\\" Wylie transliteration: \\"byang chub kyi sems\\" Vietnamese: B- tâm), \\"enlightenment-mind\\", is the mind that strives toward awakening, empathy and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings. - Songtsen Gampo (569649?/605649?) was the founder of the Tibetan Empire, and is traditionally credited with the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet, influenced by his Nepali and Chinese queens, as well as being the unifier of what were previously several Tibetan kingdoms. He is also regarded as responsible for the creation of Tibetan alphabet and therefore the establishment of Classical Tibetan, the language spoken in his region at the time, as the literary language of Tibet. - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. - The Tibetan alphabet is an abugida used to write the Tibetic languages such as Tibetan, as well as Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Ladakhi, and sometimes Balti. The printed form of the alphabet is called uchen script while the hand-written cursive form used in everyday writing is called umê script. - The Sakya (\\"pale earth\\") school is one of four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, the others being the Nyingma, Kagyu, and Gelug. It is one of the Red Hat sects along with the Nyingma and Kagyu. - The Gelug, Gelug-pa, dGe Lugs Pa, dge-lugs-pa or Dgelugspa is the newest of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism. It was founded by Je Tsongkhapa (13571419), a philosopher and Tibetan religious leader. The first monastery he established was named Ganden, and to this day the Ganden Tripa is the nominal head of the school, though its most influential figure is the Dalai Lama. Allying themselves with the Mongols as a powerful patron, the Gelug emerged as the pre-eminent Buddhist school in Tibet since the end of the 16th century. - In Tibetan Buddhism, the Red Hat sect or Red Hat sects, named for the colour of the monks' hats at formal occasions, includes the three oldest of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism, namely: - Buddhism (or ) is a religion and dharma that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to the Buddha. Buddhism originated in India sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, from where it spread through much of Asia, whereafter it declined in India during the middle ages. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (Pali: \\"The School of the Elders\\") and Mahayana (Sanskrit: \\"The Great Vehicle\\"). Buddhism is the world's fourth-largest religion, with over 500 million followers or 7% of the global population, known as Buddhists. - Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language. - Trisong Detsän or Trisong Detsen was the son of Me Agtsom and one of the emperors of Tibet. He ruled from 755 until 797 or 804 CE. Trisong Detsen was the second of the Three Dharma Kings of Tibet, playing a pivotal role in the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet and the establishment of the Nyingma or \\"Ancient\\" school of Tibetan Buddhism. - In Buddhism, buddhahood (, or ) is the condition or rank of a buddha (or , , Pali/Sanskrit for \\"awakened one\\"). - Tibet (Tibetan Pinyin: \\"boe\\", ; /i ts¹/) is a region on the Tibetan Plateau in Asia. It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa, Qiang, and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of . The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level. - Buddhist art is the artistic practices that are influenced by Buddhism. It includes art media which depict Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; mandalas and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as vajras, bells, stupas and Buddhist temple architecture. Buddhist art originated on the Indian subcontinent following the historical life of Siddhartha Gautama, 6th to 5th century BC, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world. - Padmasambhava (lit. \\"Lotus-Born\\"), also known as Guru Rinpoche, was an 8th-century Indian Buddhist master. Although there was a historical Padmasambhava, nothing is known of him apart from helping the construction of the first Buddhist monastery in Tibet at Samye, at the behest of Trisong Detsen, and shortly thereafter leaving Tibet due to court intrigues.

Allen Welsh Dulles (; April 7, 1893 - January 29, 1969) was an American diplomat and lawyer who became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), and its longest-serving director to date. As head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the early Cold War, he oversaw the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat, Operation Ajax (the overthrow of Iran's elected government), the Lockheed U-2 aircraft program and the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Dulles was one of the members of the Warren Commission. Between his stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. After the outbreak of the Second World War, Dulles was recruited to work at the Office of Strategic Services and moved to Bern, Switzerland, where he lived at Herrengasse 23 for the duration of World War II. As Swiss Director of the OSS, Dulles worked on intelligence regarding German plans and activities, and established wide contacts with German emigres, resistance figures, and anti-Nazi intelligence officers. He was assisted in intelligence-gathering activities by Gero von Schulze-Gaevernitz, a German emigrant. Dulles also received valuable information from Fritz Kolbe, a German diplomat, one whom he described as the best spy of the war. Kolbe supplied secret documents regarding active German spies and plans regarding the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter. Although Washington barred Dulles from making firm commitments to the plotters of the 20 July 1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler, the conspirators nonetheless gave him reports on developments in Germany, including sketchy but accurate warnings of plans for Hitler's V-1 and V-2 missiles. Dulles was involved in Operation Sunrise, secret negotiations in March 1945 to arrange a local surrender of German forces in northern Italy. After the war in Europe, Dulles served for six months as the OSS Berlin station chief and later as station chief in Bern. The Office of Strategic Services was dissolved in October 1945 and its functions transferred to the State and War Departments. In the 1948 Presidential election, Dulles was, together with his brother, an advisor to Republican nominee Thomas E. Dewey. The Dulles brothers and James Forrestal helped form the Office of Policy Coordination. During 1949 he co-authored the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, which was sharply critical of the Central Intelligence Agency, which had been established by the National Security Act of 1947. Partly as a result of the report, Truman named a new Director of Central Intelligence, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith.

Information: - The Gesta comitum Barcinonensium et regum Aragoniae ( \`\` Deeds of the counts of Barcelona and kings of Aragon '' ) is a Latin chronicle composed in three stages by some monks of Santa Maria de Ripoll and recounting the reigns of the Counts of Barcelona from Wifred I ( 878 -- 97 ) to James II ( 1291 -- 1327 ) , as late as 1299 . It is the fawning history of the dynasty known as the House of Barcelona . In presenting the rulers of the county of Barcelona as the descendants of Charlemagne , the monks sought to justify their independent policy with respect to the King of France , their nominal sovereign . The Gesta is the chronological backbone . The first composition was made between 1162 and 1184 and ended with the reign of Raymond Berengar IV ( 1131 -- 62 ) . In the late thirteenth century it was continued through the reign of James I ( 1213 -- 76 ) . An abridged version in the Catalan language was produced sometime between 1268 and 1283 . The final Latin version was edited in 1303 -- 14 and included the reigns of Peter the Great ( 1276 -- 87 ) , Alfonso the Generous ( 1287 -- 91 ) , and James II. Except for the first composition , all surviving versions are later copies , today preserved in the Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó , in the Biblioteca de Catalunya , and in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France . A copy of one of the latter was taken to France by Pierre de Marca and published in 1688 by Étienne Baluze . - The Kingdom of Aragon (, ) was a medieval and early modern kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula, corresponding to the modern-day autonomous community of Aragon, in Spain. It should not be confused with the larger Crown of Aragon, that also included other territories the Principality of Catalonia (which included the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan Counties), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and other possessions that are now part of France, Italy, and Greece that were also under the rule of the King of Aragon, but were administered separately from the Kingdom of Aragon. - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. - The House of Barcelona was a medieval dynasty that ruled the County of Barcelona continuously from 878 and the Crown of Aragon from 1137 (as kings from 1162). From the male part they descend from the Bellonids, the descendants of Wifred the Hairy. They inherited most of the Catalan counties by the thirteenth century and established a territorial Principality of Catalonia, uniting it with the Kingdom of Aragon through marriage and conquering numerous other lands and kingdoms until the death of the last legitimate male of the main branch, Martin the Humanist, in 1410. Cadet branches of the house continued to rule Urgell (since 992) and Gandia. Cadet branches of the dynasty had also ruled Ausona intermittently from 878 until 1111, Provence from 1112 to 1245, and Sicily from 1282 to 1409. By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastámara, descended from the \\"infanta\\" Eleanor of the house of Barcelona. - A dynasty is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a feudal or monarchical system but sometimes also appearing in elective republics. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a \\"house\\"; which may be styled \\"royal\\", \\"princely\\", \\"comital\\", etc., depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians periodize the histories of many sovereign states, such as Ancient Egypt, the Carolingian Empire and Imperial China, using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term \\"dynasty\\" may be used to delimit the era during which the family reigned and to describe events, trends, and artifacts of that period (\\"a Ming-dynasty vase\\"). The word \\"dynasty\\" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references (\\"a Ming vase\\"). - Provence (Provençal: \\"Provença\\" in classical norm or \\"Prouvènço\\" in Mistralian norm) is a geographical region and historical province of southeastern France, which extends from the left bank of the lower Rhône River to the west to the Italian border to the east, and is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. It largely corresponds with the modern administrative \\"région\\" of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and includes the \\"départements\\" of Var, Bouches-du-Rhône, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and parts of Alpes-Maritimes and Vaucluse. The largest city of the region is Marseille. - The Principality of Catalonia, is a historic territory and a medieval and early modern political entity in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula, mostly in Spain, with an adjoining portion in southern France. Between the 13th and the 18th centuries it was bordered by the Kingdom of Aragon to the west, the Kingdom of Valencia to the south, the Kingdom of France and the feudal lordship of Andorra to the north and by the Mediterranean sea to the east. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - The County of Barcelona was originally a frontier region under the rule of the Carolingian dynasty. By the end of the 10th century, the Counts of Barcelona were \\"de facto\\" independent, hereditary rulers in constant warfare with the Islamic caliphate of Córdoba and its successor states. The counts, through marriage alliances and treaties, acquired the other Catalan counties and extended their influence along Occitania. Barcelona formed the nucleus of the emergent Principality of Catalonia. In 1164, the count of Barcelona, Alfons I, inherited the Kingdom of Aragon (as Alfonso II). Thenceforward, the history of the county of Barcelona is subsumed within that of the Crown of Aragon, but the city of Barcelona remained preeminent within it. - An era is a span of time marked by character, events, changes on earth, etc. When used in science, for example geology, an \\"era\\" denotes a clearly defined period of time of arbitrary but well-defined length, such as for example the Mesozoic Era frozen m 252 Ma66 Ma, delimited by a start event and an end event. When used in social history, eras may for example denote a period of some monarch's reign. In colloquial language, eras denote longer spans of time, before and after which the practices or fashions change to a significant degree. When era is extended to a calendar system, it is known as a calendar era. In Sanskrit or Indian culture eras are known as yugas. - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Occitania (, , , , also sometimes lo País d'Òc, \\"the Oc Country\\") is the historical region in southern Europe where Occitan was historically the main language spoken, and where it is sometimes still used, for the most part as a second language. This cultural area roughly encompasses the southern half of France, as well as Monaco and smaller parts of Italy (Occitan Valleys, Guardia Piemontese) and Spain (Aran Valley). Occitania has been recognized as a linguistic and cultural concept since the Middle Ages, but has never been a legal nor a political entity under this name, although the territory was united in Roman times as the \\"Seven Provinces\\" and in the early Middle Ages (\\"Aquitanica\\" or the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse) before the French conquest started in the early 13th century. Currently about 200,000800,000 people out of 16 million living in the area are either native or proficient speakers of Occitan, although the languages more usually spoken in the area are French, Italian, Catalan and Spanish. Since 2006, the Occitan language has been an official language of Catalonia, which includes the Aran Valley where Occitan gained official status in 1990. - A prince is a male ruler, monarch, or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family. \\"Prince\\" is also a hereditary title in the nobility of some European states. The feminine equivalent is a princess. The English word derives, via the French word \\"prince\\", from the Latin noun \\"princeps\\", from \\"primus\\" (first) + \\"capio\\" (to seize), meaning \\"the chief, most distinguished, ruler, prince\\". - The House of Trastámara was a dynasty of kings in Spain , which first governed in Castile beginning in 1369 before expanding its rule into Aragón, Navarre and Naples. They were an illegitimate cadet line of the House of Ivrea. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - The Catalan counties were the administrative divisions of the eastern Carolingian \\"Marca Hispanica\\" and southernmost part of the March of Gothia created after its Frankish conquest. The various counties roughly defined what came to be known as the Principality of Catalonia. - The Bellonids, sometimes called the Bellonid Dynasty, were the counts descendant of the Goth Belló who ruled in Carcassonne, Urgell, Cerdanya, County of Conflent, Barcelona, and numerous other Catalan and Septimanian counties and marches in the 9th and 10th centuries. His most famous grandson was Wilfred the Hairy, who founded the House of Barcelona, rulers of the County of Barcelona from 878, and since 1164 the Crown of Aragon, until the end of the reign of Martin the Humane in 1410. - The Low Countries is a coastal region in western Europe, consisting especially of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the low-lying delta of the Rhine, Meuse, Scheldt, and Ems rivers where much of the land is at or below sea level. This wide area of Western Europe roughly stretches from French Gravelines and Dunkirk at its southwestern point, to the area of Dutch Delfzijl and German Eastern Frisia at its northeastern point, and to Luxembourg and French Thionville in the southeast. - A chronicle (from Greek , from , \\"chronos\\", \\"time\\") is a historical account of facts and events ranged in chronological order, as in a time line. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important. - The Carolingian dynasty (known variously as the Carlovingians, Carolingus, Carolings or Karlings) was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The name \\"Carolingian\\" (Medieval Latin \\"karolingi\\", an altered form of an unattested Old High German word *\\"karling, kerling\\", meaning \\"descendant of Charles\\", cf. MHG \\"kerlinc\\") derives from the Latinised name of Charles Martel: \\"Carolus\\". The dynasty consolidated its power in the mid 8th century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and \\"dux et princeps Francorum\\" hereditary, and becoming the \\"de facto\\" rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the Merovingian throne. In 751 the Merovingian dynasty, which had ruled the Germanic Franks was overthrown with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and a Carolingian Pepin the Short was crowned King of the Franks. The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak in 800 with the crowning of Charlemagne as the first Emperor of Romans in over three centuries. His death in 814 began an extended period of fragmentation of the Carolingian empire and decline that would eventually lead to the evolution of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire. - The Crown of Aragon was a composite monarchy, also nowadays referred to as a confederation of individual polities or kingdoms ruled by one king, with a personal and dynastic union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona. At the height of its power in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon was a thalassocracy (a state with primarily maritime realms) controlling a large portion of present-day eastern Spain, parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean \\"empire\\" which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442) and parts of Greece (until 1388). The component realms of the Crown were not united politically except at the level of the king, who ruled over each autonomous polity according to its own laws, raising funds under each tax structure, dealing separately with each \\"Corts\\" or \\"Cortes\\". Put in contemporary terms, it has sometimes been considered that the different lands of the Crown of Aragon (mainly the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Valencia) functioned more as a confederation than as a single kingdom. In this sense, the larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot).

If there are only seven mice in a habitat shared by a cat and a snake, there will be OPT: + a shared meal between them + a war between mice and cats + pressure on them to get the mice before the other does + enough for each of them to have ten mice The answer is:","completion":"Based on the fact that if two animals have the same food source, then those two animals compete for food, it can be concluded that in a habitat shared by a cat and a snake with only seven mice, there will be pressure on them to get the mice before the other does. In this scenario, both the cat and the snake are predators that rely on the same food source, in this case, mice. With only seven mice in their shared habitat, there is a limited amount of food available for both predators. Consequently, competition arises between the cat and the snake as they both need to consume the mice for their survival. This competition creates pressure on each animal to secure the available food before the other does. The cat and the snake will employ different strategies and tactics to catch the mice as efficiently and quickly as possible. This pressure not only affects the predators but may also have an impact on the overall ecosystem, as the prey population (mice) could be significantly reduced due to the competition. In summary, the presence of only seven mice in a shared habitat of a cat and a snake will introduce competition between the two predators, resulting in pressure on them to catch the mice before the other does. This scenario demonstrates the natural competition that arises when multiple species depend on a limited food source, ultimately influencing the behavior and survival of both predator and prey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post.

AFP - The eurozone economy is awash with excess liquidity and that could signal inflationary dangers ahead for the 12 countries that share the euro, official data showed.","completion":"This topic is about the eurozone economy and the potential implications of an excess liquidity situation, with official data indicating possible future inflationary dangers for the 12 countries that share the euro as their currency. Excess liquidity refers to a situation where the financial market has too much money and other types of assets, which can lead to inflationary pressures. The eurozone, or the countries that share the euro as their currency, include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. However, only the original 12 member states are impacted by this excess liquidity problem and are mentioned in the context. These countries are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Excess liquidity can have a significant impact on the economy, primarily due to its association with inflation and financial stability. Monetary policies or external factors can create a surplus of money and other assets in a market, and this increased availability of funds can lead to various consequences: 1. Lower interest rates: With an abundance of funds, banks decrease interest rates to encourage borrowing. This can boost economic activity and lead to growth in some cases, but it can also lead to inflation if it goes unchecked. 2. Inflation risk: Excess liquidity enables businesses and individuals to access more money and assets easily, leading to increased spending power. This demand for goods and services can drive up prices, sparking inflation in an economy. 3. Asset bubbles: The abundance of funds can lead investors to pump excess funds into various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, causing their prices to rise significantly and create asset bubbles. These bubbles, when they burst, can have serious consequences for the financial stability of a country or the entire eurozone if left unchecked. 4. Currency depreciation: In an effort to counteract the inflationary pressures, central banks might intervene with policies such as quantitative easing. This can increase the money supply even more, leading to the depreciation of the currency. A weakened currency has influential impacts on imports, exports, and national debt levels. 5. Misallocation of resources: Excess liquidity can lead to overinvestment in some sectors, causing inadequate allocation of resources. This can result in poor economic performance and a reduction in productivity, which could further exacerbate inflation. Given the data suggesting excess liquidity in the eurozone, it is essential for policymakers and central banks to monitor and respond accordingly to mitigate or prevent potential inflationary consequences. They may do this with interest rate adjustments, open market operations, or other policy tools to regulate the money supply and maintain the stability of their economies. In conclusion, the subject of this topic revolves around the eurozone's excess liquidity situation, its impact on the economies of the 12 member states, and the potential inflationary dangers it may produce if left unaddressed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What ideals were Greek and Roman Classical architecture not based on?","completion":"Greek and Roman Classical architecture were not based on religious or empirical ideals. This conclusion can be drawn from the passage provided, which states that the architecture and urbanism of the Greek and Roman Classical civilizations primarily evolved from civic ideals. To further elaborate, civic ideals involve concepts and principles pertaining to the community or the collective group's interests. Broadly, they could include notions of communal harmony, well-being, collective progress, or civic aesthetics. As such, the architecture and urbanism of the Greeks and Romans were primarily directed towards creating structures and urban layouts that would foster and enhance these aspects, whether it was through creating large public spaces, designing buildings that celebrated public affairs or establishing road networks for ease of citizen movement. Religious ideals, on the other hand, would imply that the architecture and urban designs were guided by religious beliefs, customs or principles - this could potentially manifest in temple structures, religious iconography, or town layouts that reflect religious cosmologies. Similarly, empirical ideals suggest a grounding in practical, experience-based or experimental knowledge - this could result in pragmatic, functionality-focused designs. However, the passage explicitly states that these were not the driving factors in Greek and Roman architecture. This is not to say that religious or empirical considerations did not factor in at all - they might well have played a role in specific aspects.

Write an article based on this summary: – What appeared to be a straightforward suicide case morphed into what's been called \\"one of northeast Ohio's biggest mysteries,\\" involving a long-dead boy, identity theft, and a war hero turned deadbeat dad. Now, per the Plain Dealer, the cold case has been (somewhat) solved, largely thanks to Peter Elliott, a persistent US marshal who discovered Joseph Newton Chandler III's real identity. After the man known as Chandler killed himself in Eastlake in 2002, the first oddity cropped up: It was found his identity had been lifted from an 8-year-old Oklahoma boy who'd died in a 1945 Texas car crash. A full probe ensued, with mostly dead ends until 2014, when Elliott came on board. Meticulous sleuthing and DNA evidence (the Washington Post goes into deeper detail on that) finally made a match: The dead man was Indiana's Robert Ivan Nichols, a decorated WWII hero who'd left his wife and sons in 1964. But that was only the first piece of the puzzle. Elliott found one of Nichols' sons, Phil, living in Cincinnati, and Phil reveals his father's strange past, including his aloofness from his family, \\"loner\\" tendencies, and the cryptic statement he made when he ditched the family: \\"In due time, you'll know why.\\" The last correspondence Phil received from his father was in 1965, and it was an envelope with no note and a single penny inside. Meanwhile, Elliott is convinced there's more still to be found out about Nichols—and even thinks there's a chance he could be the long-sought-after Zodiac Killer. \\"The first part of the mystery is solved,\\" Elliott says, per the Post. \\"Let's figure out the rest of the story.\\" Phil Nichols, meanwhile, says he holds \\"no animosity\\" toward his dad. \\"I always hoped he found a happy life,\\" he said, per Oxygen.

In 2002, a seemingly straightforward suicide case in Eastlake, Ohio turned into one of the biggest mysteries of northeast Ohio, involving a long-dead child, identity theft, and a war hero turned deadbeat dad. After Joseph Newton Chandler III took his own life, an investigation revealed that his identity had been stolen from an 8-year-old Oklahoma boy who had died in a 1945 Texas car crash. This shocking discovery led to a more in-depth investigation with mostly dead ends, until 2014 when US Marshal Peter Elliott joined the case. Through meticulous sleuthing and DNA evidence, Elliott was able to identify the man as Robert Ivan Nichols, a decorated World War II hero from Indiana. Nichols had left his wife and sons behind in 1964 without any explanation, leaving only a cryptic statement, \\"In due time, you'll know why.\\" In 1965, his son Phil received the last correspondence from his father, which was an envelope with no note and just a single penny inside. Nichols' strange past only added to the intrigue of the case. His son Phil, who now resides in Cincinnati, described his father as a \\"loner\\" who was aloof from his family. Despite the unanswered questions surrounding his father's life, Phil held \\"no animosity\\" toward him and hoped that he had found a happy life. However, the discovery of Nichols' identity has only led to more questions and speculation. US Marshal Peter Elliott, who has been persistent in solving the mystery, believes that there is still much more to uncover about Robert Ivan Nichols. In fact, he even considers the possibility that Nichols could be the infamous Zodiac Killer, a notorious serial killer whose identity remains unknown. \\"The first part of the mystery is solved,\\" Elliott says, \\"Let's figure out the rest of the story.\\" It remains to be seen what further details can be unraveled in this peculiar and enigmatic case of Joseph Newton Chandler III, or as he was truly known, Robert Ivan Nichols.

Write a text based on this summary: a mentor 's writing life renewed Text:","completion":"Title: A Mentor's Writing Life Reignited As the first light of dawn rejuvenated the sky, David Johnson, a seasoned writer and revered mentor, found himself experiencing an unexpected rebirth in his writing life. It was as if the warmth of renewed passion seeped into his heart, breathing life into words that had laid dormant for far too long. Over the years, he had traversed the literary world, offering guidance to budding writers and sharing his wealth of wisdom. Yet, amidst nurturing the creativity of others, he had momentarily lost touch with his own artistic essence. Step one: Identifying the renewed passion David embraced the surge of ideas as they broke free from the confines of his mind, finally acknowledging the desire to write once more. He realized that, while mentoring and teaching had brought him immense satisfaction, the ability to tell his own stories was still deeply ingrained within him and yearned to be expressed. Step two: Integrating past experiences As David decided to embark on this writing journey again, he knew that the wealth of experiences and lessons he had gathered throughout his time as a mentor would inevitably enhance his writing. By reflecting opon the feedback, insights, and diverse voices to which he had been exposed, he could craft richer, more compelling stories that incorporated perspectives beyond his own. Step three: Balancing the roles as a writer and mentor Eager to strike a balance between his dual role as a mentor and writer, David devised a schedule that allowed him to focus on his writing without sacrificing his commitment to his mentees. By offering dedicated periods of time for both mentoring and writing, he was able to make the most of his skills and continue contributing positively to the writing community. Step four: Encouraging collaboration In an effort to merge his roles and create a more communal learning experience, David began hosting writing workshops and group critique sessions with his mentees. This exchange of ideas, perspectives, and constructive feedback allowed both David and his students to develop their writing abilities in an inclusive and supportive environment. Step five: The continuous growth of a renewed writer and mentor With every story he penned, David refined his craft while embracing the challenges and inspirations that came along. His journey taught him that writing, like any other endeavor, is a continuous process of growth. As he continued to hone his writing abilities, sharing his experiences as a mentor, he noticed that the lives he had helped shape now bolstered the strength and substance of his own stories. In a way, the renewal of David's writing life was a testament to his unwavering passion for the art of storytelling. His dedication to the craft not only allowed him to reconnect with his own narrative voice, but ultimately enriched the writing community as a whole. Through his mentorship and the sharing of wisdom, David Johnson's writing life was indeed renewed, breathing vitality into a world of words that eagerly awaited his return."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the full name of the creator of the style that is thought to be the first to descend from the one reported in a journal in 1849? Answer the above question based on the context below: Hachijō-daiko (八丈太鼓, trans. \\"Hachijō-style taiko\\") is a taiko tradition originating on the island of Hachijō-jima. Two styles of Hachijō-daiko emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.The Hachijō-daiko tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \\"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of Hachijō-daiko. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one. The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the shita-byōshi (下拍子, \\"lower beat\\"), provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the uwa-byōshi (上拍子, \\"upper beat\\"), builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.The contemporary style of Hachijō-daiko is called shin-daiko (新太鼓, \\"new taiko\\"), which differs from Kumaoji-daiko in multiple ways.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand. After receiving help from Juliette Murray, most students probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Are much more likely to have a serious medical injury - Are much more likely to become doctors - Are much less likely to become doctors - not enough information Answer:","completion":"Are much more likely to become doctors Juliette Murray's initiative to provide realistic work experience for students interested in medicine aimed to overcome the shortcomings of the sanitized educational courses that were currently available. By giving students the opportunity to witness real-life surgeries and the pressures faced by medical professionals, it is reasonable to assume that this immersive experience would have a significant impact on students' decisions to pursue a career in the medical field. The hands-on approach offers a more accurate representation of the challenges and rewards associated with being a doctor, making it an invaluable resource for young people who are considering a career in medicine. By exposing them to the realities of the field at an early age, these students are better prepared to make informed decisions about whether medicine is the right choice for them. Thus, after receiving help from Juliette Murray and experiencing the actual work of medical professionals first hand, most students would likely have a clearer idea of what it takes to be a doctor and be more motivated to pursue a career in the medical field, making them much more likely to become doctors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The change paves the way for the Government to expand its use of nuclear power and develop fracking as a major energy source. Britain will still have to provide 15 per cent of its energy from renewable power by 2020, but after that there will be no target. Instead, the EU as a whole will have to produce 27 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2030. All change: Britain will no longer have to build more wind and solar farms after the EU scrapped rules that bind countries to renewable energy targets. Fracking can now be developed as a major energy source. The policy is a defeat for major European nations including Germany, France and Italy which had demanded a target to drive the development of wind and solar power. They were opposed by Britain, which argued for a broad target in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, leaving individual countries to decide themselves how they would meet it. The European Commission set an EU-wide target of a 40 per cent cut by 2030, but that is less ambitious than Britain’s aim of 50 per cent by 2025. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the new rules provide flexibility in tackling emissions in a cost-effective way ‘so that British consumers aren’t paying over the odds to go green’. ‘This is a really good package,’ he said. ‘It’s what we’ve been arguing for.’ Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the new rules ensure Britain isn't paying over the odds to go green. He said it allowed Britain to use a mix of energy sources, including nuclear, wind, solar and, potentially, shale gas. ‘If you want to do this in the most cost-effective way, then you allow technologies to compete,’ he said. ‘Having a technology-neutral approach means having the market get the most cost-effective way of going green, and that is the whole premise of our policies. If you set rigid, inflexible targets that is likely to result in greater cost [for the consumer].’ Mr Davey has announced plans to build the first new nuclear power station in a generation at Hinkley Point, Somerset. The £16billion plant will be developed by two Chinese companies and run by French energy firm EDF. On the development of fracking, Mr Davey said: ‘It’s good for Britain’s energy security and it is good for our carbon footprint, because shale gas will replace liquid gas that is coming from the other side of the world.’ The UK is currently on a building drive to meet the existing target of 15 per cent of energy output by renewable sources by 2020. It stands at less than 5 per cent. There are currently 120 solar farms of more than ten acres and the number will more than double this year. Green taxes on energy bills will more than double by the end of the decade, according to Npower, one of Britain’s biggest suppliers. Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think tank that is sceptical of climate change, welcomed the move. ‘Today is a big day in Brussels as the EU has begun the gradual process of rolling back its bankrupting climate and green energy policies,’ he said. The change in regulations paves the way for the Government to expand its use of nuclear power and develop fracking as a major energy source. Manufacturing leaders said the EU’s 40 per cent target in cutting emissions should serve notice that Britain is over-reaching itself for seeking higher cuts. ‘It has been clear for a while that others in Europe have little appetite to match the UK’s binding 50 per cent target and this announcement merely serves as confirmation,’ said Richard Warren, of the EEF, which represents manufacturers in the UK. He added that the target was deterring investors. Green bodies opposed the move. Nick Molho, head of climate and energy policy at wildlife charity WWF, said: ‘Today’s announcement is at the low end of what one can consider to be a credible EU response to the risks caused by climate change.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"The European Union has lifted the renewable energy target rules for its member countries, including Britain.

This change enables the UK government to expand its nuclear power usage and develop fracking as a major energy source. The decision faced opposition from Germany, France, and Italy, who demanded a renewable energy target to boost wind and solar power development. However, Britain argued for a flexible approach to control greenhouse gas emissions, leaving each nation to determine their methods.

Premise: yeah it just turns brown and makes a mess Hypothesis: It becomes a brown mess. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, it is crucial to explore the context and content of each statement and then examine their relationship. Premise: \\"Yeah, it just turns brown and makes a mess.\\" This statement suggests that a particular process or change results in something becoming brown and creating a disordered or untidy situation. The speaker appears to be acknowledging this outcome, possibly with some frustration or disappointment. Hypothesis: \\"It becomes a brown mess.\\" The hypothesis introduces the idea of a \\"brown mess,\\" which presumably refers to something that is not only disorganized but also brown in color. The hypothesis doesn't explicitly mention the process or change that leads to this outcome but it does imply that there is one. Now, let's explore the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a claim about a particular outcome (a brown mess) resulting from an unspecified process or change. The premise provides a possible context for this outcome (a process or change that involves a color change to brown and creates a mess). While both statements concern a similar outcome, they differ in their degree of specificity: - The premise is more detailed, providing specifics about the process leading to the outcome (it \\"just turns brown\\" and \\"makes a mess\\"). - The hypothesis focuses solely on the outcome (a brown mess), without delving into the process or change that led to it. In terms of logical relationship, the premise does seem to entail the hypothesis. The premise provides evidence that a process leading to a brown mess occurs, which supports the hypothesis. While the premise offers more detail about the process, it still ultimately aligns with the idea that \\"it becomes a brown mess.\\" However, it should be noted that more context is needed to fully establish the connection between the premise and the hypothesis. Without a clear understanding of the process or change discussed in the premise, it remains somewhat ambiguous whether it precisely corresponds to the brown mess described in the hypothesis. Nevertheless, based on the available information, it appears that the premise entails the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A quake of magnitude 7.9 is measured at the Earthquake centre, where Dr. Samantha Hill takes command, displacing Dr. Jordan Fisher. U.S. President Paul Hollister and FEMA Director Roy Nolan are informed about the situation. A magnitude 8.4 earthquake opens a crack which engulfs a train east of Redding, California. As a result, Governor Carla Williams, who had just seen her daughter and ex-husband off on a camping trip, agrees to help the Governor of Washington. Amanda Williams and her father Clark Williams arrive at a town named Browning, where everything is covered in a thick red haze. They discover a car with a dead family inside, and are nearly trapped in quicksand. Roy Nolan constructs a task force of the best geologists and seismologists, including Dr. Fisher and Dr. Hill. Dr. Hill mentions her Hidden Fault theory, and is eventually given permission to prove it. She and Dr. Fisher visit a lake, where they see some animals that died from carbon monoxide poisoning, and are almost poisoned themselves. Back at the Task Force Center, Dr. Hill predicts that the next quake will be near San Francisco, California. It is deemed too risky to evacuate the entirety of San Francisco, which is eventually destroyed by a 9.2 magnitude earthquake.

During World War II, the palace was bombed nine times, the most serious and publicised of which resulted in the destruction of the palace chapel in 1940. Coverage of this event was played in cinemas all over the UK to show the common suffering of rich and poor. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were in residence, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed. War-time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted, however. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen, as always, immaculately dressed in a hat and matching coat seemingly unbothered by the damage around her.

I have a crush on a girl, but she likes someone else. He's a bad guy and everyone knows it. What should I do? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Possible answers: +no. +yes.","completion":"No, these two questions are not the same but they do share similarities. Both situations involve unrequited emotions and challenges in establishing a connection with the desired individual. Let me address each situation separately and offer some guidance for both. For the first question, when you have a crush on a guy but he treats you like you're invisible, it can be a disheartening experience. Here are some steps to navigate this situation: 1. Reflect on your feelings: Before taking action, make sure that your crush is someone you genuinely like and are not just attracted to because of trivial reasons such as appearance or popularity. 2. Build your confidence: Work on building your self-esteem and confidence, as this will help you feel more comfortable around your crush and make it easier to have engaging conversations with him. 3. Reach out: Find an opportunity to initiate a conversation with him about common interests or shared activities. This could be a group assignment, a mutual friend, or even an event you both attended. 4. Don't force it: If you find the guy is not responsive or interested in engaging with you, do not force the connection. It's essential to respect his space and boundaries, and it’s possible that he may not be reciprocating your feelings. 5. Focus on yourself: Invest time in yourself, and pursue activities that make you feel happy and confident. This will not only help you develop as an individual, but it will also make you more attractive to potential romantic interests. For the second question, when you have a crush on a girl who likes someone else, especially a person who might not be a suitable partner, the situation can be challenging. Here are some steps to help you deal with this: 1. Be supportive: Be a supportive and understanding friend. You never know when she might realize the incompatibility with the other person or decide to seek a healthier relationship. 2. Open up about your feelings: When the time is right and you feel confident enough, consider sharing your feelings with her. It's crucial not to pressure her to make a decision, but instead, let her know how you feel and be prepared for any outcome, as she might not feel the same way about you. 3. Focus on self-improvement: Dedicate time to improving yourself. Develop interests, enhance your confidence, and learn new skills. This will increase her chances of seeing you as a potential romantic partner if her current situation doesn't work out. 4. Respect her decision: If she remains committed to the other person, it's essential to accept her decision and respect her choices, even if you do not agree with them. Maintaining a friendship might be challenging, so don’t be afraid to create some distance to allow yourself to heal and move forward. 5. Move on if necessary: Work on overcoming your feelings for her if she ultimately does not reciprocate your emotions. There are plenty of other people out there who may be an even better fit and share your feelings. In both situations, it is essential to remember that you cannot force someone to like you, and it's vital to respect their feelings, choices, and boundaries. Furthermore, focusing on self-improvement and self-worth can help you navigate these situations and, ultimately, find someone who genuinely appreciates and reciprocates your feelings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are related in that both individuals are concerned about their academic performance and future opportunities. However, the differences lie in the specific situations, fields of study, and goals that each individual presents. I will break down each question to highlight the differences. Question 1: The individual is pursuing a degree in Electronics and Telecommunications (E&TC) engineering, currently in their 7th semester, with an aggregate of 57.3% and two active backlogs. Their primary concern is whether they have job opportunities in the future. In this case, despite lower academic performance and a couple of active backlogs, there are still job opportunities in the E&TC engineering field. However, the individual may face competition from candidates with higher grades and no backlogs. To improve their chances of securing a job, they should focus on strengthening their practical skills, gaining relevant internships or project experience, and working on their communication and soft skills. Question 2: The individual has a 54% aggregate in Civil Engineering and has cleared six backlogs. They are interested in pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) in Project Management. They have been selected for a postgraduate course at SAMVIT school of infrastructure business and are contemplating whether to accept this opportunity or look for better opportunities abroad. In this case, the individual is considering further education as opposed to directly seeking employment. They have been offered an opportunity for further study, and their primary concern is whether they should accept this or seek better opportunities abroad. The decision depends on factors such as their financial situation, career aspirations, and the quality of education and resources available at SAMVIT and other potential institutions abroad. It is essential to research the specific M.S. programs, university rankings, and networking opportunities before making a decision. This individual may also want to consider the possibility of obtaining scholarships or financial assistance for studying abroad. In summary, while both questions stem from concerns about academic performance and exploring future opportunities, they are not the same. The first question deals with immediate job prospects for an E&TC engineering student, while the second question focuses on further education options and potential international opportunities for a Civil Engineering graduate seeking a degree in Project Management."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The US government has started a website, Admongo, to help children think critically about the advertising aimed at them. It claims to provide visitors with an \\"education\\" through games and other amusement. A cartoon man dressed in old time pilot clothing greets visitors to Admongo. \\"Call me Haiz\\", he says upon arrival in a rocket ship that opens up with a crazy world inside it. Spacey dance music plays in the background as Haiz tells visitors that they need to learn about advertising. Its inventors say eight to twelve years old is the age kids develop their critical thinking abilities. Kids that age are also a big market for advertisers. The idea behind Admongo is to teach children three things: To _ the advertiser. To know what the advertiser is really saying. And to know what the advertisement is trying to get the child to do. Children learn these things through a video game. They create their own game character. They can choose different skin colors, hair styles, eye and mouth shapes. Then they begin a trip through ad-land, where there are ads on buses and billboards. The players have to find all the marketing in the neighborhood before they can move on to the next level. The Admongo game takes players inside a home, to the advertising studio and everywhere else ads can be found. It is a complete exploration of the world of marketing. One such area is food marketing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says it is a big business. The FTC estimates that food, drink and fast-food restaurants spent more than one and a half billion dollars on advertising to young people in 2010. The FTC says children are important for three reasons. They buy products. They influence parents and caregivers to buy. And they are the future adult buyers of the products. A recent study says most advertising aimed at children is for foods of the lowest nutritional value. First Lady Michelle Obama has said she would like to see advertisers marketing healthy foods for children.

Vicki Williamson, 36, of Dundee, was driving on the A956 Charleston flyover, south of Aberdeen, when the crash happened in August 2014. Liam Thornton, 26, later died in hospital. Ms Williamson denies causing death by careless driving. Giving evidence at Aberdeen Sheriff Court, police sergeant Graham Mutch said the accident happened at the top of a sweeping bend on a slip road off the A90 Aberdeen to Dundee road. The collision investigator said the road was wet at the time. Examinations of the Vauxhall Corsa revealed that the tread on the inner edge of the rear near side tyre was under the 1.6mm legal limit. Collision investigators concluded that the most likely cause of the collision was that the car was driven at an inappropriate speed on the corner for the conditions. Earlier, Vicki Williamson gave evidence and blamed the road surface for the collision. She said: \\"It wasn't the best road conditions. I kind of took my time coming up the road. It had been really stormy the night before in Dundee to the point there was trees on the roads. \\"So I was aware that the road would be damp, wet.\\" She said she was aware of a sharp corner on the slip road coming off the A90 and estimated her speed to be about 30mph when she approached the bend because she was in third gear. Defence lawyer Alan Finlay asked: \\"Are you aware of losing control of the vehicle?\\" She replied: \\"Yes. To me it was something to do with the road surface. There was nothing I could do. \\"I tried to get the car back under control.\\" Williamson wept as she recalled the moments after the collision.

The incident occurred on the A956 Charleston flyover, south of Aberdeen, in August 2014. The victim, 26-year-old Liam Thornton, later succumbed to his injuries in the hospital. In her defense presented at Aberdeen Sheriff Court, Williamson denied the charges and blamed the road conditions for the fatal accident. She stated that the surface was wet due to a storm the preceding night, which had even knocked down trees onto the roads. Williamson also mentioned that she was cognizant of a sharp bend on the slip road off the A90 and that she, estimating her speed to be about 30mph, attempted to navigate it carefully. In her recollection, she lost control of her vehicle, attributing it to the wet road conditions. After the collision, she remembers being on the side of the road where the fire brigade was attempting to revive Thornton. Meanwhile, the prosecution's witnesses, including police sergeant Graham Mutch and other collision investigators, contradicted Williamson's account. Mutch asserted that the accident happened at a sweeping bend on a turn-off from the main A90 Aberdeen to Dundee road, apparently suggesting that the driver's speed was the main factor, not the road conditions. Further, investigations revealed that the tread on the rear near-side tire of Williamson's Vauxhall Corsa was below the legal limit of 1.6mm. The authorities thus concluded that the most likely cause of the accident was inappropriate speed at the said corner, given the conditions. The defense attorney, Alan Finlay, questioned Williamson about her awareness of losing control of the car, leading to her recount of attempts to regain control and the following moments after the crash.

And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Among them: the 1992 election of Democratic President Bill Clinton and an FBI attack the following year on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, an event seen as \\"evidence of an out of control government willing to attack citizens.\\" Under Clinton, the number...

Part of anti-extremism task force set up after death of Drummer Lee Rigby. Article:","completion":"Title: Combating Hate and Terror: New Measures to Counter Extremism in the Wake of Drummer Lee Rigby's Tragic Death Introduction: Preventing the Spread of Toxic Messages In an effort to combat the spread of radical ideologies and messages of hatred, new orders have been introduced prohibiting individuals from preaching terror and hate in public spaces. These orders are part of a larger initiative established by the UK's anti-extremism task force, which was formed following the tragic death of Drummer Lee Rigby, a British soldier who was brutally murdered by two Islamic extremists on the streets of London in 2013. The latest measures aim to keep the public safe and foster a sense of community by barring extremists from using public venues such as mosques and community halls. New Orders: Protecting the Public from Dangerous Ideologies The new regulations are designed to protect vulnerable individuals and communities from exposure to messages of hate and terror. By prohibiting radical preachers from disseminating their views in public venues, the government aims to disrupt the spread of extremist ideologies and the recruitment of potential followers. This will be achieved by a combination of surveillance, court-ordered restrictions, and measures to counter online radicalization. Mosques and community halls often serve as social hubs for many Muslim communities, and extremists have historically targeted these places to spread their toxic messages. By banning entry to such venues, the government will be better able to monitor and control the activities of radical preachers, curb the influence of terrorist organizations, and create a safer and more inclusive environment. Anti-Extremism Task Force: A Proactive Approach Following Drummer Lee Rigby's Death The establishment of the anti-extremism task force in the aftermath of Drummer Lee Rigby's murder was a clear indication that the British government was taking a strong and proactive approach to countering the rising threat of extremism. The task force, which consists of experts in fields such as law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and social policy, was formed to devise cohesive strategies and policies to address the root causes of extremism and prevent the spread of radical ideologies among vulnerable populations. Since its inception, the task force has worked diligently to develop and implement various measures aimed at curbing extremism, including new legislation to restrict the activities of terrorists and extremists, educational programs to raise awareness about the dangers of radicalization, and support services for individuals at risk of being radicalized. The newly introduced orders barring the preaching of hate messages are yet another essential tool in the anti-extremism task force's arsenal, designed to confront and contain the threat of homegrown extremism in the UK. Conclusion: United Against Extremism The UK's anti-extremism task force has reaffirmed the country's commitment to stand united against the forces of terror and hate, ensuring that the tragic death of Drummer Lee Rigby serves as a catalyst for change. By implementing these new orders, the government is taking a decisive step towards dismantling the insidious networks that promote violence and extremism. Protecting public spaces and venues from radical preachers and their messages of terror is a crucial component in building a safer society, marked by tolerance and respect. In a world increasingly marred by acts of terrorism and hatred, it is imperative to stay vigilant against the spread of extremist ideologies and support initiatives that counteract such threats to peace and security."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The name of the social movement depicted in Jacob Lawrence's paintings, which involved millions of African-Americans moving out of the rural Southern United States, is known as the Great Migration. This mass movement occurred in two major waves, the first wave from around 1916 to 1940 and the second wave from 1940 to 1970. The Great Migration was a result of several factors, including the desire of African-Americans to escape the Jim Crow segregation laws, rampant racism, and dire economic conditions in the South. They sought better opportunities in terms of employment, education, and social life in the Northern and Midwestern industrial cities such as New York, Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia. Jacob Lawrence, a prominent African-American painter, chronicled this significant historical event in his series of paintings titled \\"The Migration Series\\" (1940-41). It consists of 60 panels that visually narrate the challenging journey of African-Americans and the transformative impact of the Great Migration on both the migrants and the cities they moved to."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wrestling with feelings of guilt and regret, Larry must confront the dark secrets of his past, uncover the truth about Michael's untimely death, and reconnect with the family he left behind. Plot Summary: The film begins with Larry Montgomery (late 40s), living a prosperous but isolated life, immersed in his high-profile job as an architect in Manhattan. One night, he receives a phone call from his cousin Emma, explaining that his younger brother, Michael, has died in a car accident, and that his parents have requested him to return home for the funeral. Hesitant at first, Larry ultimately decides to confront his past and heads back to his hometown. Upon his arrival, he's met with mixed reactions. His parents, George and Edith, both harbor resentment towards him for leaving the family when they needed him the most. Larry accidentally abandoned them when his father's business went bankrupt. As Larry starts spending more time with his family, he begins to learn about the struggles that Michael faced in life - addiction, gambling debts, and the consequences of his troubled decisions. Though Larry feels responsible for not being there to help his brother, he learns from Emma, who now works as a nurse at the local hospital, that Michael was working hard to turn his life around before his death. Determined to uncover the truth about Michael's death, Larry delves deeper into the world his brother inhabited, discovering that the circumstances of the car accident may not be so cut and dry. With the help of Emma and their old friend, Tom, who is now a detective, they begin to investigate the accident and the people Michael was associated with before he died. Through his journey, Larry reconnects with the family and the town he abandoned two decades ago, and he begins to understand the value of human connections and forgiveness. As Larry unravels the mystery surrounding Michael's death, he also comes to terms with his own guilt, realizing that he can't change the past, but he can help rebuild the future for his family. Ultimately, Larry learns that Michael's death involved people he owed money to, and in an attempt to bring them to justice, he risks his own life to protect his family and seek redemption that he thinks will heal the wounds of the past. In the end, Larry decides to stay in the town, working alongside his father to revive the family business, and contributing his expertise to restore historic buildings in the community. He mends his relationship with his parents and becomes the supportive son and brother he always wished to be. \\"A Road Back Home\\" is a poignant, emotional journey that explores themes of family, forgiveness, redemption, and rediscovering the bonds that once were lost but never truly broken."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nearly all boats were made out of wood until the late 19th century, and wood remains in common use today in boat construction.

Answer:","completion":"Elm wood fights against decay when it is wet. In the given text, it is mentioned that elm wood was particularly used for the construction of boats and as water pipes because of its natural resistance to decay as long as it remained wet. This characteristic made it an ideal material for these purposes, as it could withstand the constant exposure to water and moisture. The durability and strength of elm wood in wet conditions allowed it to maintain its structural integrity and prevented rotting, making it a valuable resource in the construction of watercraft and early plumbing systems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(2) The orbital data are consistent with the secondary component either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences essentially mean the same thing, although there are subtle differences in their grammatical structure. Both sentences convey that the orbital data supports the idea that the secondary component in the system is either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star. Let's break down each sentence to explain the similarities and differences more clearly. 1. The orbital data is consistent with the secondary component being either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star. In this sentence, the subject is \\"the orbital data,\\" and \\"is\\" acts as the main verb. The phrase \\"consistent with\\" serves as a preposition, and the rest of the sentence functions as the object of that preposition. The object essentially describes the possible nature of the secondary component, stating that it could be either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star. 2. The orbital data are consistent with the secondary component either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star. In this sentence, the subject is once again \\"the orbital data,\\" but the main verb is \\"are\\" instead of \\"is.\\" This subtle change shifts the agreement between the subject and the verb, which could be attributed to different conventions in British and American English. British English tends to treat collective nouns (like \\"data\\") as plural, while American English typically considers them as singular. Additionally, the word \\"being\\" is omitted in this sentence, making a slight structural difference. However, the meaning remains the same - the secondary component could be a red dwarf or a white dwarf star, according to the orbital data. Overall, the meaning conveyed by both sentences is the same, despite minor differences in their grammatical structure. They both express the idea that the orbital data is in line with the secondary component being either a red dwarf or a white dwarf star."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan dropped more bombs during the first quarter of 2018 than it has in the same period in any of the last 15 years, according to Pentagon data. The increased bombing is the latest evidence the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan is significantly intensifying since U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new military strategy for the country in August. Coalition planes dropped 1,186 weapons on Afghanistan during the first three months of 2018, according to figures released by U.S. Air Forces Central Command. The previous record (1,083) was set during the height of the war in 2011. The U.S. has not released 2001 to 2003 airstrike data. Those figures do not include activity by the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which has stepped up its aerial bombardment since gaining the ability to conduct airstrikes two years ago. The AAF carries out between 4 to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. If recent trends are any indication, 2018 is likely to get even more violent. Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources. But there is little indication the expanded airstrikes are helping end the conflict, says Thomas Johnson, an Afghanistan specialist who teaches national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. \\"It's basically a tactic of desperation,\\" said Johnson, author of Taliban Narratives: The Use of Power and Stories in the Afghanistan Conflict. \\"There's never been an insurgency in history that's been defeated purely through air power.\\" Even high-level U.S. military officials concede the conflict remains a stalemate.

Jump off your board by placing your back foot onto the ground in front of the skateboard, and following with your front foot. Begin running in the direction that you were traveling in and only stop the board once you have slowed down and regained control. Practice your running technique from a stationary skateboard first. Once you have got the hang of this, try running from a moving board, in a quiet space. Only try this at the skate park after lots of practice. Bailing is when you opt out of a trick before you get hurt. If you know that you're about to fall hard, you can try and stop the trick before it's too late, and jump off your board. Rather a bruised ego, than a bruised leg! It is important to kick your board away when bailing, as you don't want to land back on your board and slip over. If you kick forward there is a greater chance that you will land back on the board, so always kick the board behind you by kicking your legs back. Bailing isn't good for your board deck, and it will cause scratches and chips. However, it is better to bail and chip your board, than to not bail and hurt yourself. If a fall is inevitable, you need to use all your limbs to soften the impact. It is important to keep your arms and legs loose so that they can absorb the shock of the fall. If you stiffen your body, there is a greater chance of you breaking bones. Keep those limbs loose! Don't break falls by using only your outstretched arms. Wrist injuries are rife in skateboarders, and this is going to hurt or cause you to break your wrists. It's a good idea to wear knee-pads and if you are going to fall whilst on a ramp, always fall on your knees. This will cause you to slide down the ramp, and avoid serious injury. Rolling distributes the impact of a fall and prevents serious injury. Remember to shield your face with your arms and aim to land on your back or shoulders. Practice falling correctly on a soft surface before you hit the skate park. This way you'll be prepared for future falls and falling safely will become second nature to you. Summary:","completion":"1. Practice getting off the skateboard and running in a controlled manner to prevent falls. 2. Learn to bail and kick the board away from you if a fall is imminent. 3.

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

This family suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there. Atta initially went to Germany in July 1992 and was still registered as a student until the fall of 1999, which is more than 5 years. Therefore, the correct answer should be that Atta went to Germany to continue his education and was there for more than 7 years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: - When water freezes it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space - As water expands it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it - The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack - Clay expends when wet like ice does - This causes rock to break apart - Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The last step of the process involves the combined action of physical, chemical, and biological weathering, which leads to the gradual breakdown and disintegration of rocks, ultimately contributing to the formation of soil. Upon the breaking apart of rocks due to the expansion of water upon freezing and the swelling of clay, as well as the growth of plants like mosses and lichens on bare rock, the surface area of the rock is further exposed to various weathering agents. As a result, physical weathering, such as freeze-thaw cycles, continues to weaken and expand existing cracks in the rock, further disintegrating it over time. Additionally, various other weathering processes contribute to the breakdown of rocks. Chemical weathering takes place when minerals within the rocks chemically react with elements in the environment, such as water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. This may lead to the dissolution of minerals, oxidation, or the formation of new, weaker minerals, such as clay, that are more susceptible to erosion. Biological weathering plays a significant role, too. The initial growth of mosses and lichens on bare rock creates a more favorable environment for other plant species to take root. As these plants grow and expand, their roots penetrate deeper into the cracks and crevices of the rock, exerting pressure that further weakens the rock structure. Additionally, microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, contribute to the chemical weathering by producing acids that react with the minerals in the rock. As these physical, chemical, and biological weathering processes continue, rock particles are gradually broken down into smaller fragments. Over time, these fragments accumulate and mix with decaying organic matter, such as dead leaves, plant roots, and microorganisms. This mixture eventually develops into soil, providing a nutrient-rich medium for plant growth and supporting a diverse ecosystem. In conclusion, the last step in this process involves the continuous weathering of rocks through the combined action of physical, chemical, and biological processes, eventually leading to the formation of soil and supporting the growth of various plant species, thus contributing to the overall development and sustenance of ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: what distance the canyon is set? Movie plot title: One-Eyed Jacks Movie plot: Rio (Marlon Brando) (also called \\"The Kid\\"), his mentor Dad Longworth (Karl Malden), and a third man called Doc rob a bank of two saddlebags of gold in Sonora, Mexico. The robbery is successful, but Mexican Rurales track them and catch them celebrating in a cantina, killing Doc. Dad and Rio manage to escape. After getting cornered on a high ridge, with Rio's horse dead, Rio figures the Rurales will be \\"swarming all over us inside an hour.\\" Deciding that one partner might take the remaining pony, ride to a jacalito down the canyon about five miles and return with fresh mounts, they gamble for it, with Rio fixing the deal so his pal Dad can be the one to go. Dad gets to a corral, strapping the swag bag onto a fresh pony, but he gets second thoughts. He casts one eye towards a point on the ridge sure to be taken by the Rurales, and with the other he gazes off in the opposite direction out past a low-lying treeline towards the border and safety. One way leads to danger and a poor chance at surviving with half the booty, the other towards a virtual certainty with all of it. After a decidedly short moment of reflection, he leaves his friend to be taken by Rurales. Rio is arrested and transported to prison by way of the jacalito, where he learns firsthand of Dad's betrayal from the owner. Rio spends five hard years in a Sonora prison, giving him ample time to mull over Dad's betrayal before escaping with new partner Chico Modesto (Larry Duran) and going hunting for him. When he locates him, Longworth has used his wealth to become the sheriff of Monterey, California. Instead of ambushing Dad, Rio gives him a chance to explain why he left him back in Mexico, pretending he had never been captured to put him off-guard. Longworth's awkward self-serving story is easily seen through. All along Rio planned not only to kill Dad, but to pull off a bank robbery in Monterey with his new partners Chico and \\"scum-suckin' pig\\" Bob Emory (Ben Johnson) (who used his knowledge of Dad's whereabouts to force their partnership).

This was summarised at the time by the slogan \\"No taxation without representation\\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

Here is a more detailed and appropriate answer for the question: Exxon Mobil Corporation, commonly known as ExxonMobil, is a publicly traded multinational oil and gas corporation. Being a publicly traded company, ExxonMobil is owned by its shareholders who hold shares of common stock. The ownership of the company is distributed among individual investors, institutional investors, and company insiders. The largest shareholders of ExxonMobil include investment management firms such as Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and State Street Global Advisors, as well as individual shareholders who invest in the company through purchasing stocks. Institutional investors typically own a significant portion of the company's shares. However, the ownership structure can change daily as shares are traded on stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In addition to shareholders, ExxonMobil's Board of Directors plays a critical role in governing the company. The Board of Directors is elected by the shareholders and represents their interests in overseeing the management and strategic direction of the company.

Matthew Macklin was sore, obviously heartbroken, but gracious in defeat. A thunderous right hook from Jorge Sebastien Heiland of Argentina had knocked him out in the 10th round of their WBC world middleweight title eliminator at the 3 Arena on Saturday night. He is now left with the unappealing and likely decision to retire without winning a world title. A student of boxing, he pointed out fighters who had numerous title shots before reaching the summit but also name-checked legends of the sport who fought because they were fighters. He deserves access to that club. ‘Look at the [Jake] LaMottas and all them — they lost many, many times and still went on and won a world title,’ said Macklin in his dressing-room after the fight. ‘How many footballers have bad games? It’s just in boxing you’re as good as your last fight. Matthew Macklin could be nearing retirement after suffering a devastating defeat in Dublin. ‘It’s a shame because now the world title looks further away and maybe it’s just not to be for me. Maybe that fight in Germany will haunt me forever.’ That fight in Germany was a reference to his 2011 points loss to Felix Sturm in Cologne in a WBA world-title fight. He was awarded the decision by German TV pundits that night, but the judges, bafflingly, awarded the win to Sturm. In hindsight, it was his best opportunity to win a world title, despite the fact that he went on to headline at Madison Square Garden against Sergio Martinez and later challenged pound-for-pound monster Gennady Golovkin. Now it seems likely that this could be the end for the two-time European champion after his sixth career loss brings his record to 31-6. Macklin was stopped by Jorge Sebastien Heiland in the 10th round of their WBC world title eliminator. Heiland and Macklin went toe to toe for 10 rounds. After a clean left hand landed on Macklin’s chin, that right hook from Heiland left the home fighter on the canvas 42 seconds into the round. In truth, the Birmingham-born Tipperary man looked every inch of his 32 years from the third round on and the aggregate damage of a pro career which started in his teens made him look, for the first time, a very tired fighter. ‘He was decent and I knew he was good,’ said Macklin of Heiland afterwards. ‘No one wants to admit they’re getting older but the pace of the fight… it probably suited him more than me.’ A constantly busy 27-year-old Heiland was too much to deal with. Argentine Heiland celebrates victory over Macklin in Dublin on Saturday night. ‘I’ve got the sort of face where I show every emotion anyway, so I looked tired after a round!” laughed Macklin afterwards, but the 32-year-old is now, undoubtedly, considering retirement. ‘I’ve had tough fights, tough spars and lived in f***ing hotel rooms all over the world! It’s a tough-ish life, but I’ve had more highs than lows, definitely.... I’ll just have to see.’ The unusual predicament Macklin finds will finds himself in is whether to fight on considering there is a possibility that he could yet book an All-Ireland showdown with Limerick’s Lee or a date with England’s Martin Murray. Promoter Eddie Hearn pinpointed Dublin middleweight Luke Keeler as a star in the making after the 27-year-old demolished Gary Boulden in one round, while he hinted that Cork’s Gary ‘Spike’ O’Sullivan could yet become a major player in the 160lb division after he battered Anthony Fitzgerald inside two minutes.

What is the answer: Santorini is part of which country?","completion":"Santorini is a beautiful and picturesque island that belongs to the country of Greece. Greece, officially known as the Hellenic Republic, is a southeastern European nation comprised of a mainland and a vast number of islands. Santorini, which is often considered one of Greece's most popular and iconic destinations, is part of the Cyclades group of islands that can be found in the Aegean Sea. Santorini, also known as Thira, is renowned for its stunning sunsets, volcanic caldera, whitewashed buildings, blue-domed churches, and breathtaking views. The island has a unique crescent shape, which was formed due to a massive volcanic eruption that occurred approximately 3,600 years ago. This eruption resulted in the creation of the island's famous caldera, a depression encircling the archipelago. Tourism is a significant contributor to Santorini's economy, and the island offers a variety of activities and points of interest for visitors. Some of the highlights include the picturesque villages of Fira and Oia, the ancient city of Akrotiri, wine tours, and exploring the island's volcanic beaches, such as the Red Beach and the Black Beach. Visitors can also take a boat tour to the volcanic islands of Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni, where they can hike and even swim in natural hot springs. Santorini's cuisine is influenced by the island's unique geography and long history. Local dishes showcase the flavors and ingredients of the Mediterranean, and visitors can savor delicacies such as fava beans, cherry tomatoes, and white eggplants, all of which are grown on the island. Additionally, Santorini is celebrated for producing exceptional wines, particularly the much-loved Assyrtiko, a white grape variety that thrives in the island's volcanic soil. In Greek mythology, Santorini is associated with Atlantis, the legendary sunken city. The catastrophic eruption that shaped the island's geography is believed by some to have been the source of Plato’s account of the doomed civilization. While the association between Santorini and Atlantis remains speculative, the island undoubtedly possesses a captivating charm and history that attract visitors from all around the world. In conclusion, Santorini is a beautiful, volcanic island located in the southeastern European nation of Greece. As part of the Cyclades group of islands in the Aegean Sea, it offers an array of activities, attractions, and rich history that make it a popular tourist destination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is easy to sing hosannas for Max Verstappen, the boy who will make his Formula One debut for Toro Rosso next year at 17 years of age, becoming the youngest driver in the sport’s history. He is a talented driver by all accounts and appeared precociously assured before the assembled media in the paddock in Spa this weekend. Many fellow racers here have given him a generous welcome to the most exclusive drivers’ club in the world. Here is Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, speaking self-deprecatingly about Verstappen, son of Jos, the Dutch driver of the 1990s and early 2000s. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Who is 16 year old F1 driver Max Verstappen? Ready for the challenge? Max Verstappen, 16, will become the youngest driver in the history of Formula One at 17 years old when he joins the Scuderia Toro Rosso team next season. Centre of attention: Verstappen was composed during his first press conference at Spa in Belgium this week after being announced as Toro Rosso's new driver. ‘I don’t know Max at all,’ said Button. ‘I knew his father because I raced against him, as did Fernando (Alonso) and Kimi (Raikkonen), I think. Somebody obviously thinks he’s ready for Formula One because they have given him the opportunity. ‘I got my drive with Williams when I was 19 years old. I wasn’t ready for Formula One. I was ready when I was 23. But I took the opportunity because it might not come again. Frank (Williams) phoned me up – I was in the pub with my mates having a pint of beer – and said, “Do you think you are ready for Formula One?” I said: “Definitely not”. He said: “OK, right, thank you.” ‘I put the phone down and phoned my dad and he said, “You’re kidding me!” He said: “phone him back and tell him you are.” So I called him back and said I was ready. Frank invited me to the factory and that’s how it all started – I got the test and got the drive. 'For anyone who comes into the sport and is given the opportunity, as a driver, a dad or a manager, you have to take it. Whether Max is ready, nobody knows.’ Ready or not: Jenson Button admitted he wasn't ready for the challenges of Formula One until the age of 23. Pedigree: Verstappen on the podium during an FIA Formula 3 European Championship race at Silverstone. Button was being very fair. He raised doubts about the suitability of a 17-year-old – which will make him two years younger than the youngest previous driver, Jaime Alguersuari – but cautioned us against judging Verstappen by his own standards between the age of 19 and 23. Jacques Villeneuve, a former team-mate of the young Button at BAR Honda, was less sympathetic towards the experiment. The 1997 world champion, who made his F1 debut aged 24, said: ‘Basically, it’s like getting all the presents without deserving anything. But there is this thing of “the younger, the better”. What's the next step? A team who will sign someone at 15 just to get the image out of it? ‘It is the wrong way round. Caesar and Napoleon were good from the beginning but it takes time before you become an emperor. You build it. ‘He is still a boy so it is very risky. You don’t take a 16-year-old, who hasn’t even been to university, into the best hospital as a doctor, even if he is very good and very intelligent. Sceptical: Former world champion Jacques Villeneuve (left), seen here with Verstappen (right) and his father Jos, said Toro Rosso's appointment represented a big risk. Number one: Verstappen celebrates after winning the Zandvoort Masters of Formula 3 race last month. ‘You need to pay dues. You need to deserve it because that is only how you will become a man.’ Speaking to Autosport, Villeneuve added: ‘Getting a Super Licence (a prerequisite for Formula One) should be meaningful – not just doing three hundred kilometres and it being fine.’ I tend to agree with many of Villeneuve’s observations. Formula One should be the pinnacle; the final logical step in a career through various formulas. That a boy who only started racing cars this year, in Formula Three, can be deemed able to drive in Formula One may reveal how easy it is – in comparison to years gone by – to drive these cars. When Susie Wolff, of Williams, stepped in to test earlier this season, she was alarmingly close to the team’s regular race driver Felipe Massa on the timesheets, and, by all accounts, she is hardly Stirling Moss. But more than anything I hope Max is not burned in the exercise. Being a former Formula One racer while still in his teens would be an unwelcome conclusion to an astonishingly youthful beginning. Bernie Charles Ecclestone, 83 years old, is back in command behind the opaque glass – from the outside that is – of his portable HQ. I suspect the underground movement that pressed for change in their longed-for post-Bernie era will fall silent again now that he is not going to jail for bribery. It was always thus in Formula One. Back in charge: Bernie Ecclestone talks to reporters at Spa in advance of the Belgian Grand Prix. He is once again able to concentrate his energies fully on Formula One following the end of his bribery trial in Germany. One senior paddock figure told me that he would like to excise the whole current crop of drivers. They are, he thought, too highly trained in the dark, spin-doctoring wiles of saying nothing interesting. This view is not entirely misplaced. Nico Rosberg, for example, was coy despite being angry with Lewis Hamilton for not moving over as instructed during the last race in Hungary. Perhaps he was being smart, but some former drivers would have given vent to their feelings. Or, to put it another way, told it how it was. Ditto with Marussia’s Max Chilton and the curious issue of whether he would race this weekend in Belgium. He provided no explanation for his reinstatement a day after announcing he would sit out the grand prix. However, we journalists are not entirely blame-free in all this obfuscation. We criticise people for small slips of the tongue. They clam up more. The relationship between press and participant worsens. It is a vicious circle. Guarded: Nico Rosberg had little to say on Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes team orders in his press conference ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses Max Verstappen's debut in Formula One at the age of 17, making him the youngest driver in the sport's history. Many fellow racers and world champions, such as Jenson Button and Jacques Villeneuve, have shared their opinions on whether Verstappen is ready for the challenges of F1. Button was fair in his assessment, saying that he himself wasn't ready for F1 until the age of 23, while Villeneuve expressed concern about the risk involved in hiring such a young driver.

The disorder may damage blood vessels and increase the risk of dying early, according to new research presented today at an annual meeting of the American Heart Association. The study included about 286,000 mostly male veterans between the ages of 45 and 81 who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and conflicts dating back to the Korean War. The vets with PTSD -- who accounted for roughly 10 percent of the study participants -- had more than double the risk of dying during the 10-year study compared to their peers who didn't have disorder, the researchers found. Health.com: Depression, PTSD common among Iraq vets. Twenty-nine percent of the vets with PTSD died during the study, compared to 8 percent of the vets without PTSD. (The overall death rate in the study was 13 percent.) The increased risk of death associated with PTSD held even after the researchers controlled for factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. A separate analysis involving heart scans from 637 of the veterans found that men and women with PTSD had more calcium buildup in their arteries than vets without post-traumatic stress. Calcium buildup is a hallmark of atherosclerosis (also known as hardening of the arteries), which can lead to heart attacks. Health.com: Surprising heart attack risks. Among veterans with similar degrees of calcium buildup, those who had PTSD were 48 percent more likely to die of any cause during the study and 41 percent more likely to die from heart disease compared to those without PTSD, according to the study, which was led by Naser Ahmadi, MD, a cardiologist at the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center. \\"If a vet has PTSD, they need to be under surveillance for cardiovascular disease as they age,\\" says Joseph Boscarino, PhD, a senior investigator at Geisinger Center for Health Research, in Danville, Pennsylvania., and an expert on the link between post-traumatic stress and physical illness. Boscarino did not participate in the new study. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs after exposure to a traumatic event, including sexual abuse and military combat. People with the condition experience recurring, intrusive memories about the event, and may also experience emotional numbness and detachment. Health.com: Traumatized? Playing Tetris may reduce flashbacks. Previous studies have linked PTSD to a greater risk of death and heart disease, but the new study is the first to explore what's behind the relationship. The explanation is likely complicated, says Laura Kubzansky, PhD, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston. Inflammation stemming from constant stress may be involved, she says, but other factors or unhealthy behaviors -- such as not getting enough exercise -- may be partly responsible as well. \\"People with PTSD are trying to make themselves feel better in lots of different ways,\\" says Kubzansky, who didn't take part in Dr. Ahmadi's study. Behaviors such as smoking \\"clearly contribute, but there's something else going on.\\" It's not clear from the study whether treating PTSD can lower a person's risk of atherosclerosis or heart disease. Still, Dr. Ahmadi says that PTSD should be treated using effective techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, preferably as soon as possible after the traumatic event. \\"If you don't treat PTSD, it's like a vicious cycle,\\" he says. Health.com: Can Ecstasy help ease post-traumatic stress? Boscarino says that thousands of veterans have contacted him to ask whether they can make disability claims for heart disease and post-traumatic stress to the Veterans Administration. \\"The veteran community is very frustrated right now because they can't get a ruling on this [from the VA],\\" he says. \\"They have to fight each case over and over again, which is not the case for Agent Orange...or other military disability exposures.\\" Dr. Ahmadi presented his findings at the American Heart Association's annual Scientific Sessions meeting, which highlights the latest heart-related research and treatment advances. Unlike studies published in medical journals, the research presented at the meeting has not been vetted by independent experts in the field. Copyright Health Magazine 2011. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The article highlights a research study that found Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may damage blood vessels and increase the risk of dying early. Conducted on 286,000 mostly male veterans who served in various conflicts, the study showed that veterans with PTSD had more than double the risk of dying during the 10-year study compared to their peers who did not have the disorder. Twenty-nine percent of the vets with PTSD died during the study, compared to 8 percent of the vets without PTSD. The increased risk of death associated with PTSD remained even after controlling for factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. Additionally, heart scans from 637 veterans found that individuals with PTSD had more calcium build-up in their arteries than those without PTSD, which indicates atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries and can lead to heart attacks. Among veterans with similar degrees of calcium build-up, those with PTSD were 48 percent more likely to die of any cause during the study and 41 percent more likely to die from heart disease compared to those without PTSD. The research suggests that those with PTSD need to be monitored for cardiovascular disease as they age. Previous studies have also linked PTSD to a higher risk of death and heart disease, but this study is the first to explore the underlying relationship. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that may arise after exposure to a traumatic event, including sexual abuse and military combat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Who is most educated Indian politician ever? Why are most Indian politicians uneducated? Do those questions have the same meaning? OPTIONS: A. no; B. yes;","completion":"A. no The two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question asks for information about the most educated Indian politician ever. In contrast, the second question inquiries about why most Indian politicians are uneducated. Therefore, the correct answer is A. no. To answer the first question, there is no definitive \\"most educated Indian politician\\" as there are several politicians in India who have impressive educational backgrounds. However, some notable examples of highly educated Indian politicians include: 1. Dr. Manmohan Singh - Dr. Singh served as the Prime Minister of India from 2004 to 2014. He has degrees in Economics from three universities: Panjab University, Cambridge University, and Oxford University. Additionally, he has served in various prominent international organizations, such as the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund. 2. Shashi Tharoor - Tharoor is an accomplished author, diplomat, and politician. He has held various positions within the Indian National Congress and in the Parliament, representing Thiruvananthapuram. He holds a Bachelor's degree in History from St. Stephen's College, Delhi University, and two Master's degrees and a Ph.D. from Tufts University, the United States. 3. Dr. Subramanian Swamy - A prominent leader from the Bharatiya Janata Party, Dr. Swamy has a Bachelor's degree from the University of Delhi, a Master's degree from the Indian Statistical Institute, and a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University. Now, to answer the second question, it is important to recognize that not all Indian politicians are uneducated. Nevertheless, there are several factors contributing to the perception that many Indian politicians are uneducated, including: 1. The political environment - Political systems in India often prioritize loyalty, dynastic politics, and other factors unrelated to educational qualifications as criteria for political success. 2. Education and politics - Many politicians come from a variety of backgrounds and, as they may have entered politics at a young age, they might not have had the opportunity to pursue higher education. As such, politics becomes a viable career option for those without formal educational qualifications. 3. Lack of regulations - There is no minimum educational requirement to be elected into Indian political offices. As a result, many politicians may have little formal education. 4. Representation - In a diverse democracy like India, it is essential that the political representatives come from various backgrounds, including those with limited formal education. This allows for a broader range of perspectives and better representation in the decision-making process. In conclusion, it is crucial to note that while there are cases of highly educated Indian politicians, several factors contribute to the perception of \\"uneducated\\" politicians in India. However, both questions are not the same in meaning as they inquire about different aspects of Indian politicians and their education."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is named after the River Exe, the source of which is situated in the centre of the area, two miles north-west of Simonsbath. Exmoor is more precisely defined as the area of the former ancient royal hunting forest, also called Exmoor, which was officially surveyed 18151818 as in extent. The moor has given its name to a National Park, which includes the Brendon Hills, the East Lyn Valley, the Vale of Porlock and of the Bristol Channel coast. The total area of the Exmoor National Park is , of which 71% is in Somerset and 29% in Devon. - Minehead is a coastal town and civil parish in Somerset, England. It lies on the south bank of the Bristol Channel, north-west of the county town of Taunton, from the border with the county of Devon and in proximity of the Exmoor National Park. The parish of Minehead has a population of approximately 11,981 making it the most populous town in the West Somerset local government district. This figure includes Alcombe and Woodcombe, suburban villages which have been subsumed into Minehead. - Rolling is a type of motion that combines rotation (commonly, of an axially symmetric object) and translation of that object with respect to a surface (either one or the other moves), such that, if ideal conditions exist, the two are in contact with each other without sliding. - The Norman conquest of England was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman, Breton, and French soldiers led by Duke William II of Normandy, later styled as William the Conqueror. - Gloucestershire (; abbreviated Glos.) is a county in South West England. The county comprises part of the Cotswold Hills, part of the flat fertile valley of the River Severn, and the entire Forest of Dean. - Dunster is a village, civil parish and former manor within the English county of Somerset, today just within the north-eastern boundary of the Exmoor National Park. It lies on the Bristol Channel coast south-southeast of Minehead and northwest of Taunton. The United Kingdom Census of 2011 recorded a parish population of 817. - Taunton is the county town of Somerset, England. The built up area of the town had a population of 64,621 in 2011. - Dorset (or archaically, Dorsetshire) is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast. The ceremonial county comprises the non-metropolitan county, which is governed by Dorset County Council, and the unitary authority areas of Poole and Bournemouth. Covering an area of , Dorset borders Devon to the west, Somerset to the north-west, Wiltshire to the north-east, and Hampshire to the east. The county town is Dorchester which is in the south. After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation, while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density. - A hammermill is a mill whose purpose is to shred or crush aggregate material into smaller pieces by the repeated blows of little hammers. These machines have many sorts of applications in many industries, including: - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - The Anarchy was a civil war in England and Normandy between 1135 and 1154, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order. The conflict was a succession crisis precipitated by the accidental death of William Adelin, the only legitimate son of Henry I, in 1120. Henry's attempts to install his daughter, the Empress Matilda, as his successor were unsuccessful and on Henry's death in 1135, his nephew Stephen of Blois seized the throne with the help of another nephew, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester. Stephen's early reign was marked by fierce fighting with English barons, rebellious Welsh leaders and Scottish invaders. Following a major rebellion in the south-west of England, Matilda invaded in 1139 with the help of her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester. - Dunster Working Watermill ( also known as Castle Mill ) is a restored 18th century watermill , situated on the River Avill , close to Gallox Bridge , in the grounds of Dunster Castle in Dunster , Somerset , England . It is a Grade II * listed building . The mill stands on a site where a mill was first recorded in the Domesday Book , but the present building was constructed around 1780 . It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used to grind flour . The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels . It is owned by the National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company . - Somerset is a county in South West England which borders Gloucestershire and Bristol to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east and Devon to the south-west. It is bounded to the north and west by the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel, its coastline facing southeastern Wales. Its traditional border with Gloucestershire is the River Avon. Somerset's county town is Taunton. - A shell keep is a style of medieval fortification, best described as a stone structure circling the top of a motte. - Dunster Castle is a former motte and bailey castle, now a country house, in the village of Dunster, Somerset, England. The castle lies on the top of a steep hill called the Tor, and has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century. - A textile or cloth is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibres (yarn or thread). Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton, or other material to produce long strands. Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, or felting. - A sawmill or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber. Prior to the invention of the sawmill, boards were rived (split) and planed, or more often sawn by two men with a whipsaw, one above and another in a saw pit below. The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade. - A hammer is a tool or device that delivers a blow (a sudden impact) to an object. Most hammers are hand tools used to drive nails, fit parts, forge metal, and break apart objects. Hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. - Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains or roots and used to make many different foods. Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures, making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history. Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern, North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Bristol is a city, unitary authority area and county in South West England with an estimated population of 449,300 in 2016. It is England's sixth and the United Kingdom's eighth most populous city, and the most populous city in Southern England after London. The city borders the Unitary Authority areas of North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the historic cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively. - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million. - South West England is one of nine official regions of England. It is the largest in area, covering and the counties of Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, as well as the Isles of Scilly. Five million people live in South West England. - A metal (from Greek \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms. - A paper mill is a factory devoted to making paper from vegetable fibres such as wood pulp, old rags and other ingredients using a Fourdrinier machine or other type of paper machine. - The Severn Estuary is the estuary of the River Severn, the longest river in Great Britain. It is at the mouth of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range of about means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy. - The River Avill is a small river on Exmoor in Somerset, England. - A water turbine is a rotary machine that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of water into mechanical work. - Wiltshire (or ) is a county in South West England with an area of . It is landlocked and borders the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The county town was Wilton but Wiltshire Council is now based in the new county town of Trowbridge. - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point. - A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of free-flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load. - A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses moving water as its power source. It is thus a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. Thus watermills may be gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, wire drawing mills, and so on. - Lumber (American English; used only in North America), or timber (used in the rest of the English speaking world) is wood that has been processed into beams and planks, a stage in the process of wood production. Lumber may also refer to currently un-needed furniture, as in Lumber room, or an awkward gait, ultimately derived from the look of unfashionable and unwanted furniture. - A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing. The wheel is one of the main components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel and flywheel. - Wire drawing is a metalworking process used to reduce the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). There are many applications for wire drawing, including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, paper clips, spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. Although similar in process, drawing is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a cold working process, but it may be performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a versatile material with many uses, including writing, printing, packaging, cleaning, and a number of industrial and construction processes.

Usage: \\"PersonX accidentally dropped ___ on the ground\\" The Head phrase describes an event involving a subject (PersonX) who accidentally dropped something (represented by the placeholder ___) on the ground. This is important for understanding what the Head event is, in order to determine the sequence of events with the Tail event. Part #2: Identify the Tail phrase. Usage: \\"Blame PersonX\\" The Tail phrase describes another event where someone (possibly PersonY or PersonZ or any other person) blames PersonX for something. This is important for understanding what the Tail event is, in order to determine the sequence of events together with the Head event. Part #3: Determine if the Head happens after the Tail or not. Usage: \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" The objective is to determine if the Head event (PersonX accidentally dropped ___ on the ground) happens after the Tail event (Blame PersonX) or not. In this example, the Head event likely happened before the Tail event because PersonX needs to drop something first before someone can blame them. So, the answer is \\"No.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In sociology, emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture. In anthropology, the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities. Some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities. In the field of communication sciences, critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations, from the perspectives of managers, employees, and even customers. A focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to Arlie Russell Hochschild's concept of emotional labor. The University of Queensland hosts EmoNet, an e-mail distribution list representing a network of academics that facilitates scholarly discussion of all matters relating to the study of emotion in organizational settings.

The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum' The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'. Classify your answers into coord, hyper, mero, attri, event, and random. Input: Concept: whale, Relatum: food.

Whale: a large marine mammal with a streamlined hairless body, a horizontal tail fin, and a blowhole on top of the head for breathing. Food: any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink or that plants absorb in order to maintain life and growth. Now let's consider each category: 1. Co-hyponym (coordinate): As whale and food do not belong to the same semantic class, they don't have a coordinate relation. 2. Hypernym: Food is not a category that includes whale as a specific instance, so it's not a hypernym. 3. Meronym: Food is not a part/component/organ/member of a whale, so it's not a meronym relation. 4. Attribute: Since food is not an adjective that describes an attribute of a whale, it's not an attribute relation. 5. Event: Food is not a verb about an action involving a whale, so it's not an event relation. None of the above categories fit the relation between \\"whale\\" and \\"food.\\" Therefore: Output: random"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

TJ had been placed in charge of the children when the kids' grandmother, Katherine, left home on July 15 and will watch the children while the legal proceedings play out in a California court. TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children A 1995 article in People described the brothers' childhood as normal despite their famous father, uncle and aunts. Taj Jackson told the magazine: \\"My mom made sure that we had a real childhood, with birthday parties, baseball, family outings, all that stuff.\\" They were close to their Uncle Michael. \\"He's like a third parent to us,\\" Taj told People in 1995. Eventually the brothers went along on one of his tours and decided to form a singing group and were recording their first album in 1994 at the time of their mother's death. Initially it was believed Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her.

The speaker emphasizes their belief that the actions being taken or the plan being discussed will have a positive impact on the citizens of Moldova. This optimistic statement shows confidence in the approach and suggests that living conditions, economic opportunities, or general well-being of the people in the country will see notable improvements. Moldova, a small landlocked country located in Eastern Europe, has faced economic and political challenges since gaining independence in 1991. The country has been making strides in recent years to improve the quality of life for its citizens, such as through reforms, social programs, and infrastructure development. However, it's essential to continue working on viable solutions that will contribute to the country's progress and secure a better future for the Moldovan people. One way to improve the lives of the Moldovan people is to strengthen the nation's economy. Investing in education, promoting entrepreneurship, and supporting local industries can help citizens build sustainable livelihoods, reduce poverty, and contribute to the nation's overall economic growth. Another essential aspect of improving the lives of Moldova's citizens is ensuring access to quality healthcare services. This includes investing in modern facilities, medical equipment, and skilled professionals, which will help to promote healthier lifestyles and improve overall well-being. Improving infrastructure is another critical factor in enhancing the lives of the Moldovan people. This includes updating transportation networks, such as roads, railways, and public transportation, as well as improving access to essential utilities like water, electricity, and sanitation services. Political stability and good governance are also crucial for Moldova's development. Removing corruption, promoting transparency, and ensuring that all citizens have a voice in the decision-making process will help to foster sustainable growth and improvements in living standards.

Why does Trump shape his fingers like a vagina during his speeches? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information, specifically, regarding the gestures made by former President Donald Trump during his speeches. To provide a detailed answer: While it is not accurate to say that former President Donald Trump intentionally shapes his fingers to resemble a specific body part, it is true that he frequently uses particular hand gestures during his speeches. One of the most common gestures he employs is the \\"OK\\" gesture (forming a circle with his thumb and index finger, with the other three fingers extended). This gesture is sometimes interpreted as mimicking the shape of a vagina, though this interpretation is subjective. Understanding why Trump utilizes this gesture requires an examination of his communication style and body language. The use of hand gestures in communication helps individuals emphasize points, convey emotions, and establish a connection with their audience. Trump is widely known for his expressive and animated speaking style, which often includes various gestures that can convey confidence, dominance, and emphasis on critical points. The specific gesture in question, the \\"OK\\" gesture, has been used by speakers throughout history for various reasons. In Trump's case, it appears to be a way for him to stress important concepts and to demonstrate precision, as the circular shape formed by the fingers may symbolize the notion of \\"zeroing\\" in on something. Additionally, the extended three fingers can signify that the speaker is making a point or demonstrating a general sense of assertiveness. It is important to consider that Trump's use of this gesture has likely been influenced by cultural factors and the way he has developed his communication style over the years. People tend to adopt certain habits and behaviors without being consciously aware of them. Therefore, it is unlikely that Trump deliberately shapes his fingers in that specific manner to convey a hidden meaning. Instead, it may simply be an aspect of his natural speaking style and a result of his learned behaviors. In conclusion, the hand gesture made by former President Donald Trump during his speeches – the \\"OK\\" gesture – is not intentionally meant to resemble a specific body part. Instead, it is a means of emphasizing key points and demonstrating assertiveness, precision, and confidence. The interpretation of this gesture varies, but its purpose is rooted in communication and body language rather than any hidden meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed.

Plot title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home.

The general removes a red spire from the table and destroys it; the thunderclap as the piece is shattered resonates through the city and sets off a trap that ensnares the three brigands. The red spire's destruction is clearly an act of treason, and for this and other crimes they are sentenced by Jor-El for banishment into the Phantom Zone.Many years after traveling through the galaxy, the Phantom Zone is shattered near Earth by the shockwave from the harmless detonation of a hydrogen bomb launched into space by Superman.

One day, however, her agency's primary client, short-tempered Cyrus Baxter, happens to be seated beside her. (His chauffeur had abruptly quit after Baxter berated him for getting stuck in a traffic jam.) He is delighted when he overhears that she named her \\"child\\" Cyrus after him. He becomes acquainted with her, letting her assume that he works for Baxter as a watchman. Later, when the agency's two bosses, Sam Morley and Barry Holmes see Baxter to try to get him to sign a contract for a new advertising campaign, he insists they keep her happy, to their puzzlement. Morley and Holmes discover that she has been fired; they quickly hire her back and promote her from her secretarial duties. Meanwhile, Baxter keeps seeing Patsy, trying to help her with his namesake. She manages to maintain her charade, but Morley sees them together and assumes that she is Baxter's mistress. Patsy discovers her new friend's identity when her bosses send her to present their latest idea. Meanwhile, Baxter's temper improves under Patsy's influence. When Morley and Holmes finally learn the truth, Patsy wants to confess all to Baxter, but they insist she carry on the masquerade until they get his signature on the contract. She reluctantly agrees, after they point out that they will probably have to close if they do not get Baxter's business, throwing hundreds out of work.

Summarize: After Wayne Madsen had hit exactly 100, his sixth Championship ton of the summer, first-innings centurion Harvey Hosein got to 59 to take his total of runs in the match to 167 at New Road. But the visitors lost their last five wickets for 11 runs to collapse to 266. Worcestershire then took 9.4 overs to reach their target on 40-1 - their third Championship win in four matches. After resuming on 15-1, Madsen and Hosein looked to have taken the prospect of victory out of Worcestershire's reach with a fifth-wicket stand of 124, before Hosein's 57-run stand with Tom Milnes (36). But home skipper Daryl Mitchell put himself on and took two wickets in successive overs to get rid of Milnes and debutant Greg Cork. Spinner Brett D'Oliveira then removed Hosein and Will Davis in the space of two deliveries before Miguel Cummins had Tony Palladino leg before. Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes told BBC Hereford & Worcester: \\"A lot of the crowd went home because they anticipated the game fizzling out. \\"At tea five wickets sounds a lot to get but we lost five for five at Hove. We reminded the players of that at tea because they were pretty tired after two days out there in the field. \\"You can never predict what happens in cricket but Daryl Mitchell came on, got a couple of wickets and we finished them off. It was nice to end with another win.\\" Derbyshire captain Billy Godleman told BBC Radio Derby: \\"The guys battled very hard. Harvey Hosein and Wayne Madsen played magnificently again but the top order were not able to take enough time out of the game in the second innings. \\"It's obviously been a new-ball wicket.

Article: The 30 miles of steep roads that snake through the mountains of Logan Canyon in Utah are enough to make most drivers'hands sweat. But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear River Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Andersen had driven through the Canyon hundreds of times over the years. The weather was fine-but the higher they drove, the more slippery the roads became. Rounding a sharp U-turn at mile marker473, Andersen saw a truck that had skated off the road and immediately tapped his brakes. In an instant, the car was sliding at 25 miles per hour toward the shoulder of the highway, then rolling down a steep ten-foot dam toward the extremely cold Logan River. As it hit the water, the car tipped toward the passenger side, hesitated, and then rolled onto its roof and sank into the river. There was no time to tell the kids what to do. The crash had broken a few windows, and within seconds, the upside-down car was filled with water. \\"It was frightening how fast we were completely underwater,\\"remembers Andersen, a soft-spoken product development manager.\\"You're thinking, is this how it's all going to end?\\" Having lost all sense of direction, Andersen began to search the freezing water for the kids. Mia had been right next to him in the front seat; now, in the blackness, he couldn't find her.\\"I thought, if I don't get out, maybe none of us are going to get out.\\" Andersen got out of his seat belt, swam through a broken window, and, deeply and quickly, breathed air at the surface. That's when he saw a group of men, about ten in all, appear at the top of the dam. One after another, they raced down into the water. Helping onto safety all the three children, they began to shout at the father,\\"Who else is in the car?\\"Andersen says respectfully,\\" _ .\\" Question: Andersen didn't expect any trouble on the road because _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"he was familiar with the road\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, Andersen didn't expect any trouble on the road because he was familiar with the road. As mentioned in the article, Andersen has driven through the Logan Canyon hundreds of times over the years, which gave him a sense of confidence and familiarity with the route. The 30 miles of steep roads and mountainous terrain were nothing new to him, and the fine weather on that day further strengthened his confidence in a trouble-free journey. However, unexpected circumstances led to their car sliding off the road and into the Logan River. The fact that he had not anticipated any problems on the journey only highlights the unpredictability of nature and how caution should always be exercised even on familiar routes. The 46-year-old father of four found himself in a dire situation, with his car submerged in the freezing river and his children's lives at stake. Despite being familiar with the road and having driven it many times, accidents can still occur and catching anybody off-guard. In this case, his familiarity with the road may have given him a false sense of security. In conclusion, Andersen's familiarity with the road did not protect him and his passengers from encountering an unexpected and life-threatening event. Overall safety on the road depends on various factors, including weather conditions, attentiveness, and proper vehicle maintenance. Even the most experienced drivers may find themselves facing unforeseen circumstances, emphasizing the importance of always being prepared and cautious."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? rashomon-for-dipsticks","completion":"In order to determine the sentiment of the given phrase, \\"rashomon-for-dipsticks,\\" we must first analyze its parts and discern its intended meaning. The phrase combines two separate concepts: \\"Rashomon\\" and \\"dipsticks.\\" \\"Rashomon\\" refers to a 1950 Japanese movie directed by Akira Kurosawa. The film is celebrated for its unique narrative technique where different characters recount their perspectives on the same event. The term \\"Rashomon effect\\" has since been derived to describe situations where people interpret the same event in contrasting ways due to subjective perceptions. Generally, the context of Rashomon indicates an intricate, thought-provoking story that explores the complexities of human nature. On the other hand, \\"dipsticks\\" is a slang term, often used in a derogatory manner, referring to someone who might be considered slow-witted, incompetent, or foolish. This term carries a negative connotation due to its pejorative use. With both parts analyzed, we can now examine the sentiment of the whole phrase. The combination of \\"Rashomon\\" with \\"dipsticks\\" seems to convey a negative sentiment. It suggests a simplified version of \\"Rashomon\\" catered to the perceived unintelligent or incapable audience, or it could be referring to individuals who cannot understand the deep and complex narrative of the original film and require a basic or \\"dumbed-down\\" version.

Check with your insurance company for policy details. If you are in a high-risk area for floods, you should be insured. People in other areas may choose flood insurance to protect against water damage. Sealing your basement makes it more resistant to water. Fill in cracks and spread sealant over the walls. Keep the gutters on your house clean, too. Levees and floodwalls may also be built to help hold back floodwater. Install a sump pump. When the pump senses water on the floor, it pumps it out of your home. Make sure the pump drains properly and maintain its battery-powered backup with fresh batteries. Raise up your furnace, water heater, and electric panels. They should be installed on top of blocks or set higher in the wall than normal. This will better prevent them from getting wet. Before a flood occurs, store all valuables, such as expensive rugs, appliances, and important documents, on a higher floor in your home. Disconnect your utilities when there’s potential for a flood. Shut off the main valves and breakers. Unplug all electrical appliances unless you are standing in water. Take care of valuables before flooding begins. You may not have time to do this once the water starts rising.","completion":"Flood insurance is a crucial safeguard for homeowners and business owners, especially for those located in high-risk flood areas. It can provide significant protection and financial relief in the event of water damage. Consult with your insurance provider to obtain policy specifics and ensure appropriate coverage based on your location and risk factors. Even those not in high-risk areas may opt for flood insurance to shield against potential damages. To minimize the impact of potential flooding, consider various preventative measures. Start by sealing your basement, filling in any cracks, and applying a sealant to walls to enhance water resistance. Additionally, maintain clean gutters to facilitate proper water drainage. In areas particularly prone to flooding, levees, and floodwalls may be constructed to help contain floodwater and limit property damage. Installing a sump pump can also be beneficial as it actively removes water from your home when it detects moisture on the floor. Ensure that the pump is draining correctly and that its battery-powered backup system is functioning optimally with fresh batteries. Elevate critical appliances and utilities, such as your furnace, water heater, and electric panels, by placing them on blocks or installing them higher within the walls. This reduces the likelihood of water damage during floods. Furthermore, store valuable items like expensive rugs, appliances, and important documents on upper floors or elevated surfaces to mitigate potential losses. In anticipation of a flood, disconnect utilities by shutting off the main valves and breakers and unplugging all electrical appliances, provided you are not standing in water. Address these precautions before flooding occurs, as there may be insufficient time to do so once water levels begin to rise. Ultimately, a combination of flood insurance and these preventive strategies can provide substantial protection for your property and valuable belongings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

LE GRAND VOYAGE is a gentle miracle of a film, a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer/director Ismaël Ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars Nicolas Cazalé and Mohamed Majd to carry the emotional impact of the film. Ferroukhi's vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of Katell Djian (a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters) and the musical score by Fowzi Guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys. Reda (Nicolas Cazalé) lives with his Muslim family in Southern France, a young student with a Western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage. His elderly father (Mohamed Majd) has decided his time has come to make his Hadj to Mecca, and being unable to drive, requests the reluctant Reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation. The two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through France, into Italy, and on through Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, and Turkey to Saudi Arabia. Along the trip Reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights, but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and Reda is irritably left to struggle with his father's demands. On their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman (Ghina Ognianova) who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by Reda, a Turkish man Mustapha (Jacky Nercessian) who promises to guide the father/son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting Reda drunk in a bar and disappearing, and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons. Tensions between father and son mount: Reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps, and the father cannot comprehend Reda's insensitivity to the father's religious beliefs and needs. At last they reach Mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trip's significance is overwhelming to Reda. The manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning. It has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age, between son and father, and between defiance and acceptance of religious values. The visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so because it feels as though the camera just 'happens' to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects. Nicolas Cazalé is a superb actor (be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film 'The Grocer's Son') and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film. Another fine film from The Film Movement, this is a tender story brilliantly told. Highly recommended.

Information: - Sverker I or Sverker the Elder (Old Swedish: \\"Swærkir konongær gambli\\"), murdered 25 December 1156, was King of Sweden from about 1130 till his death. - Västergötland, also known as West Gothland or the Latinized version Westrogothia in older literature, is one of the 25 traditional non-administrative provinces of Sweden (\\"landskap\\" in Swedish), situated in the southwest of Sweden. - Östergötland (English exonym: East Gothland) is one of the traditional provinces of Sweden (\\"landskap\\" in Swedish) in the south of Sweden. It borders Småland, Västergötland, Närke, Södermanland and the Baltic Sea. In older English literature, one might also encounter the Latinized version, \\"Ostrogothia\\". The corresponding administrative county, Östergötland County, covers the entire province and parts of neighbouring provinces. - Småland is a historical province (\\"landskap\\") in southern Sweden. Småland borders Blekinge, Scania (Swedish: \\"Skåne\\"), Halland, Västergötland, Östergötland and the island Öland in the Baltic Sea. The name Småland literally means \\"Small Lands\\". The Latinized form \\"Smolandia\\" has been used in other languages. The highest point in Småland is Tomtabacken, at 377 metres (1,237 ft). - The Peace of Westphalia was a series of peace treaties signed between May and October 1648 in the Westphalian cities of Osnabrück and Münster, effectively ending the European wars of religion. These treaties ended the Thirty Years' War (16181648) in the Holy Roman Empire, and the Eighty Years' War (15681648) between Spain and the Dutch Republic, with Spain formally recognizing the independence of the Dutch Republic. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Thirty Years' War was a series of wars in Central Europe between 1618 and 1648. It was one of the longest and most destructive conflicts in European history, as well as the deadliest European religious war, resulting in eight million casualties. Initially a war between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, it gradually developed into a more general conflict involving most of the great powers. These states employed relatively large mercenary armies, and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the FranceHabsburg rivalry for European political pre-eminence. In the 17th century, religious beliefs and practices were a much larger influence on an average European than they are today. During that era, almost everyone was vested on one side of the dispute or another, which was also closely tied to people's ethnicities and loyalties, as religious beliefs affected ideas of the legitimacy of the political status of rulers. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - Martin Luther (10 November 1483 18 February 1546), O.S.A., was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money, proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his \\"Ninety-five Theses\\" of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Ödeshög Municipality (\\"Ödeshögs kommun\\") is a municipality in Östergötland County, Sweden.

It was founded in the first half of the 12th century by a donation of land from King Sverker I of Sweden to the Cistercian Order . It was dissolved and appropriated by the Crown at the time of the Protestant Reformation . - The Ninety-five Theses or Disputation on the Power of Indulgences are a list of propositions for an academic disputation written in 1517 by Martin Luther, professor of moral theology at the University of Wittenberg, Germany. They advance Luther's positions against what he saw as abusive practices by preachers selling plenary indulgences, which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment for sins committed by the purchasers themselves or their loved ones in purgatory. In the \\"Theses\\", Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than the system of sacramental confession of the Catholic Church. He argued that indulgences lead Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they can forgo it by purchasing an indulgence. They also, according to Luther, discourage Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy, believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable. Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the pope, the \\"Theses\\" challenge a fourteenth-century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins. The \\"Theses\\" are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther's opinions, but Luther later clarified his views in the \\"Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences\\". - The Baltic Sea ( ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain.

It is known for being the seat of the Cistercian Alvastra Abbey in the Middle Ages, established in 1143 by French monks. After the Swedish Lutheran reformation in the 1530s, the monastery was demolished, never to be rebuilt. - A schism (pronounced , or, less commonly) is a division between people, usually belonging to an organization, movement, or religious denomination. The word is most frequently applied to a split in what had previously been a single religious body, such as the EastWest Schism or the Great Western Schism. It is also used of a split within a non-religious organization or movement or, more broadly, of a separation between two or more people, be it brothers, friends, lovers, etc. - The provinces of Sweden are historical, geographical and cultural regions.

Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Protestant Reformers were those theologians, churchmen and statesmen whose careers, works and actions brought about the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. Historically speaking, \\"Protestant\\" was the name given to those theologians, magnates and delegations present at the Holy Roman Imperial Diet of Speyer in 1529 who protested the revocation of the suspension, granted at a prior Diet of Speyer in 1526, of Edict of Worms of 1521, which had outlawed Martin Luther and his followers. - Södermanland, sometimes referred to under its Latin form \\"Sudermannia\\" or \\"Sudermania\\", is a historical province or \\"landskap\\" on the south eastern coast of Sweden.

Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Protestant Reformation, often referred to simply as the Reformation (from Latin \\"reformatio\\", \\"restoration, renewal\\"), was a schism from the Roman Catholic Church initiated by Martin Luther and continued by John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and other early Protestant Reformers in 16th century Europe. Timing most commonly used for this period is from 1517 (the Ninety-five Theses are published by Martin Luther) to 1648 (Peace of Westphalia ends the Thirty Years' War). - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancersÂ â Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to \\"escape\\", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require \\"a deep sacrifice\\" but bring a \\"perfect victory\\".

After a brief period of supremacy by King Harshavardhana, the region was once again divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some Rajput principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by Delhi Sultanate a number of times. Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered Kangra at the beginning of the 10th century.

This produces a bolus which can be swallowed down the esophagus and into the stomach. Here it is mixed with gastric juice until it passes into the duodenum where it is mixed with a number of enzymes produced by the pancreas. Saliva also contains a catalytic enzyme called amylase which starts to act on food in the mouth. Another digestive enzyme called lingual lipase is secreted by some of the lingual papillae on the tongue and also from serous glands in the main salivary glands. Digestion is helped by the mastication of food by the teeth and also by the muscular actions of peristalsis and segmentation contractions. Gastric juice in the stomach is essential for the continuation of digestion as is the production of mucus in the stomach. Can we conclude that is the esophagus part of the digestive tract?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that the esophagus is indeed a part of the digestive tract. The digestive tract, also known as the alimentary canal or the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, is a continuous pathway that starts from the mouth and ends at the anus. It is responsible for breaking down the food we consume, absorbing the nutrients, and eliminating the waste products. The esophagus plays a crucial role in this process as it connects the mouth to the stomach, allowing the passage of the chewed food bolus from the mouth to the stomach for further digestion. The esophagus is a muscular tube, approximately 25 centimeters long, which runs behind the trachea (windpipe) and the heart, and in front of the spine. When food is swallowed, the process called peristalsis pushes the food down the esophagus through rhythmic, involuntary muscle contractions. At the end of the esophagus, a ring-like muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter opens to allow the food bolus to enter the stomach and then closes to prevent the stomach acid and food from flowing back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and other gastrointestinal issues. Moreover, the lining of the esophagus produces mucus that aids in lubricating the pathway for the smooth passage of food. This highlights the significance of the esophagus as an integral component of the digestive tract, working in coordination with other organs such as the mouth, teeth, tongue, stomach, and intestines to facilitate proper digestion and absorption of nutrients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Background: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Paragraph: Henry is currently writing a research paper for his biology class. The subject of the paper is abiotic stress. For his paper, he is analyzing two different forests of differing stress levels and writing about the differences seen in the environments. For the area with a low level of stress Henry chose the Narshe Forest, located near the mountains of Harkal. The area of high stress that Henry will be looking at is the Midgar forest.

His wife has recently committed suicide, and the agency decides that he needs to take on a less challenging assignment: to find an aging Nazi war criminal and get him \\"before God does\\". In order to track down the old man, Eyal poses as a tour guide and befriends the Nazi's adult grandchildren, Axel and Pia. Pia lives on a kibbutz, an Israeli commune. Her brother Axel visits her in order to convince Pia to return to Germany for their father's seventieth birthday. It is later revealed that Pia's estrangement with her parents began when she discovered that they were hiding her grandfather. She shares this information with Axel. Although he has a job to perform, Eyal truly befriends Axel and Pia. Axel and Pia are decent people who demonstrate that most Germans have gotten beyond the hatred that led to the Holocaust. They spend time together and Eyal enjoys himself, even if he would not openly admit so. His friendship with Axel allows him to display some humanity, letting down his tough-guy machismo. Eyal and Axel even take a mud bath by the Dead Sea, showering off together in the nude afterward. When the three are at dinner one night in a Tel Aviv restaurant, Axel speaks privately to the Palestinian waiter, Rafik, and finds out where the best club in town is. Later that evening, Axel, Pia, and Eyal arrive at the club. Eyal is shocked to discover that it is a gay club. He sees Axel dancing with Rafik and is taken aback. Eyal is initially disgusted and disappointed to discover that Axel is gay. He asks to be removed from the assignment, not attempting to hide his homophobia as the reason.

Summarize: The Wire were up 22-4 at the break thanks to tries from Ben Currie, Tom Lineham, Kevin Penny and Stefan Ratchford, with Dom Manfredi replying. Free-scoring winger Manfredi completed his hat-trick with a second-half double as Wigan improved after the break. However, the visitors scored again through Ryan Atkins to seal the points. Wigan were unbeaten in 21 months on home turf in Super League before last month's defeat by Widnes, but have now lost twice this term and trail Warrington by two points. Shaun Wane's side gave a debut to Jack Higginson amid their injury concerns, and saw influential captain Sean O'Loughlin limp off at half-time with a hamstring problem. Meanwhile, Warrington gave a fine performance to cement their early title ambitions, and win their first game in five at the DW. Atkins' score was his fourth in as many games, but Warrington also lost two key personnel in Chris Sandow to a hamstring issue of his own and Rhys Evans with a shoulder problem. Warrington coach Tony Smith: \\"I couldn't care less if Wigan were going to win it, I was worried about my players. It was tough, we couldn't rotate them after losing those two players in the first half. \\"We had a number of players who shouldn't have been on there after a while with some of the knocks they took. \\"I saw the determination of the players - they weren't going to let it slip.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Humans have sewn by hand for thousands of years. It was said that the first thread was made from animal muscle and sinew . And the earliest needles were made from bones. Since those early days, many people have been involved in the process of developing a machine that could do the same thing more quickly and with greater efficiency. Charles Wiesenthal, who was born in Germany, designed and received a patent on a double-pointed needle that eliminated the need to turn the needle around with each stitch in England in 1755. Other inventors of that time tried to develop a functional sewing machine, but each design had at least one serious imperfection. Frenchman Barthelemy Thimonnier finally engineered a machine that really worked. However, he was nearly killed by a group of angry tailors when they burned down his garment factory. They feared that they would lose their jobs to the machine. American inventor Elias Howe, born on July 9, 1819, was awarded a patent for a method of sewing that used thread from two different sources. Howe's machine had a needle with an eye at the point, and it used the two threads to make a special stitch called a lockstitch. However, Howe faced difficulty in finding buyers for his machines in America. In frustration, he traveled to England to try to sell his invention there. When he finally returned home, he found that dozens of manufacturers were adapting his discovery for use in their own sewing machines. Isaac Singer, another American inventor, was also a manufacturer who made improvements to the design of sewing machines. He invented an up-and-down-motion mechanism that replaced the side-to-side machines. He also developed a foot treadle to power his machine. This improvement left the sewer's hands free. Undoubtedly, it was a huge improvement of the hand-cranked machine of the past. Soon the Singer sewing machine achieved more fame than the others for it was more practical. It could be adapted to home use and it could be bought on hire-purchase. The Singer sewing machine became the first home appliance, and the Singer company became one of the first American multinationals. However, Singer used the same method to create a lockstitch that Howe had already patented. As a result, Howe accused him of patent infringement . Of course, Elias Howe won the court case, and Singer was ordered to pay Howe royalties . In the end, Howe became a millionaire, not by manufacturing the sewing machine, but by receiving royalty payments for his invention. 1. What was the first thread made from? 2. What about the needles?

Scout, she says, was politically active in progressive causes. Scout, a brilliant student despite numerous medical issues, suffered from depression and had attempted suicide two years ago, Lynne Schultz said. According to Georgia Tech police, Scout was seen walking toward police and ignored numerous orders to drop what appeared to be a pocket knife. Photos of the knife taken at the scene reveal the blade was not extended.

That’s among the questions the GBI will be asking as the state agency investigates the shooting. A Georgia Tech student was shot by police in an incident on the campus late Saturday night. (Photos by Dalton Touchberry / www.daltontouch.com) Police said the shooting was prompted when Scout Schultz failed to comply with their repeated commands to drop the knife. Chris Stewart, the attorney for the student’s parents, said it appears the officer who shot Scout overreacted. “I think (Scout) was having a mental breakdown and didn’t know what to do,” said Stewart, who wondered why nonlethal force wasn’t used. “The area was secured. There was no one around at risk.” Scout Schultz was shot in the heart and was pronounced dead 30 minutes later at Grady Memorial Hospital, Lynne Schultz said. Two years ago, Scout attempted suicide by hanging, the student’s mother said. Stewart said he doesn’t believe Scout was attempting “suicide by cop.” RELATED: How Atlanta police handle calls involving mentally ill Scout was majoring in computer engineering and was already taking courses for a master’s degree in biomedical engineering, with plans to design biomedical devices for a living. Scout identified as non-binary, meaning neither male nor female, Lynne Schultz said. The accepted pronoun for non-binary individuals is “they.” Most of Scout’s stress was related to school, the student’s mother said. “Scout was always a perfectionist,” Lynne Schultz said. “They always worried he was going to fail a test but got all A’s and only two B’s at Tech.” “(Scout) had a lot of empathy for people, active in a lot of causes.

According to the GBI, the Georgia Tech Police Department responded to a 911 call about a person with a knife and gun in the area of Eighth Street on the campus at about 11 p.m. Saturday. Officers arrived and found Scott Schultz, 21, armed with a knife outside a Georgia Tech dormitory. Schultz was not cooperative and would not comply with officers' commands to drop the knife, the GBI said. They said Schultz approached the officers, despite continuous commands. Scout Shultz served as president of the Georgia Tech Pride Alliance GT Progressive Student Alliance The GBI said that is when one of the officers shot Schultz. Schultz was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital and later died, the GBI said. Schultz's family is speaking about the incident at a law firm in Atlanta Monday. We have a reporter and photographer at the news conference for live reports on Channel 2 Action News at Noon. Georgia Tech released a statement Sunday morning, saying Schultz was a four-year computer engineering student from Lilburn. Schultz was a leader in the LGBT pride community on campus was known as \\"Scout.\\" The student-activist served as the president of the Pride Alliance on Georgia Tech's campus. Schultz's profile on the Pride Alliance website states \\"I'm bisexual, non-binary and intersex,\\" adding \\"they\\" and \\"their\\" as the appropriate pronouns to address Schultz instead of \\"he\\" or \\"she.\\" The profile also states Schultz enjoyed playing the role-playing game \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" and is politically active. In a statement from the Pride Alliance's board, Schultz is remembered as a driving force behind the group. As you might have heard, last night we lost our President, Scout Schultz. We are all deeply saddened by what has occurred. They have been the driving force behind Pride Alliance for the past two years. They pushed us to do more events and a larger variety events, and we would not be the organization we are known as without their constant hard work and dedication. Their leadership allowed us to create change across campus and in the Atlanta community. Scout always reminded us to think critically about the intersection of identities and how a multitude of factors play into one's experience on Tech's campus and beyond. We love you Scout and we will continue to push for change. With love, Pride Alliance A vigil will be held to honor Schultz's life at 8 p.m. Monday at the Georgia Tech Campanile. In an exclusive interview with our partners at the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, Scout's mother Lynne says her oldest child was active in progressive causes and was a brilliant student despite having medical problems. She told the paper, \\"(Scout) suffered from depression and attempted suicide two years ago.\\" Channel 2 Action News was at the scene when the knife Schultz was suspected of holding was still on the ground. It appeared to be a metal, flip-open, multitool knife that would likely include a small blade. \\"I mean things happen off campus, but it's kind of shaking for it to happen right so close to home,\\" one student said. TRENDING STORIES: Several of the students nearby did see the incident, and two who recorded it on their cellphones shared video of the incident with Channel 2 Action News. One video shows the tense moments as Georgia Tech police officers confront what looks like a barefooted person holding something in their right hand. The person yells at police to shoot. \\"Shoot me!” they yell. Police yell back: “Drop the knife! Drop the knife!\\" Officers can be heard repeating the command more than a dozen times. \\"Nobody wants to hurt you man. Drop the knife,\\" an officer says. Another angle from further away shows three officers in front and another off to Schultz's left, at the entrance to Curran parking deck. It pans away to show another officer walking up from behind as you hear only one gunshot. Channel 2 Action News has chosen, both on-air and online, to not to show the moment of the shooting. The video does show Schultz walking forward, toward police slowly, with hands still at his side when one of the officers fired. Students received an emergency alert from the university shortly after the shooting. The school tweeted around 11:30 p.m. for everyone to seek shelter in a secure location. About 20 minutes later, the school sent another tweet saying there was no longer a threat to campus. Schultz's family attorney confirmed to Channel 2's Nefertiti Jaquez he is currently conducting his own investigation into exactly what happened during the shooting. The attorney is expected to address the media on Monday morning. Georgia Tech confirms shooting on campus.

That student, Scout Schultz, left three suicide notes behind in a dormitory room, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The developments added further layers of complexity to the death of Schultz, a 21-year-old who led the university’s Pride Alliance and had a history of mental illness. In the call to police Saturday night, Schultz described a suspicious person “as a white male, with long blond hair, white T-shirt & blue jeans who is possibly intoxicated, holding a knife and possibly armed with a gun on his hip,” according to a statement from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Investigators said a multipurpose tool that contained a knife was recovered from the scene. The statement did not say whether the knife was displayed but said no firearms were recovered. An attorney for Schultz’s family said in a statement Monday night the knife remained in its holder and Scout’s arms were at the student’s side. “It’s tragic that as Scout was battling mental health issues that pushed them to the edge of desperation, their life was taken with a bullet rather than saved with non-lethal force,” said the statement from L. Chris Stewart, the Schultz family attorney. The parents of Schultz said their child, who identified as neither male nor female, had suffered from anxiety and depression, and had spent time in counseling after attempting suicide by hanging two years ago. But Scout’s death stunned Lynne and Bill Schultz, who described Scout as “a very loving and caring and empathetic person.” “I don’t think there was a single person that didn’t love them and cherish them for their involvement in the different causes,” Bill Schultz said. On Monday night about 50 people marched to the campus police department following a memorial vigil, according to University spokesman Lance Wallace. Three people were arrested after protesters set one police vehicle on fire and injured two officers. Schultz’s family urged protesters to act peacefully in a statement released through their attorney, according to the Associated Press. “Answering violence with violence is not the answer. Our goal is to work diligently to make positive change at Georgia Tech in an effort to ensure a safer campus for all students.” The shooting in Atlanta comes as police nationwide continue to face protest and media scrutiny over the use of deadly force. Police across the country shoot and kill an average of three people each day, a rate virtually unchanged in recent years despite calls from police leaders and the public for reform. Mental illness remains a major factor in fatal police shootings, playing a role in at least one-fourth of all such shootings — at least 159 so far in 2017 — according to a Washington Post analysis. Police reform groups have long emphasized the need for officers to undergo specialized crisis intervention training to learn best practices for interaction with people who are in the midst of a mental health crisis, but many police departments still do not require such training. Since January 2015, police nationwide have shot and killed at least 392 people who were armed with knives, blades or other edged weapons — an average of about one such shooting every four days — according to the Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings. At least 102 of those cases, including the shooting of Schultz, occurred in 2017. Fatal shootings of people armed with knives account for about 14 percent of the nearly 2,700 deadly police shootings tracked by The Post since the beginning of 2015. Officers from Georgia Tech’s campus police force encountered Schultz, a computer engineering student, in a parking lot outside a dormitory, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Schultz wasn’t holding a gun in video captured from a window above the parking lot shortly before midnight, as the campus was placed on lockdown. Stewart, the attorney, said Schultz was shot once and that the bullet pierced the heart. Stewart said only one officer fired and that none of the other officers who responded from the Georgia Tech police department had been issued Tasers. A spokesman for Georgia Tech told CNN that campus police do not carry stun guns. “That’s baffling to me that on a college campus you’d rather give the officers the most deadly weapons and not equip them with less lethal weapons,” Stewart said, noting that Schultz’s family is hoping the death leads to reforms within the department, including better training. Video shows officers repeatedly telling Schultz to drop the weapon as the student advances. “Come on, man, let’s drop the knife,” an officer with his gun drawn says in the graphic video. But Schultz walks toward him. “Shoot me!” The officer keeps backing up, moving behind a parking barricade and imploring again: “Nobody wants to hurt you, man.” At least four officers had surrounded Schultz, according to WSB-TV. In the video, one of the officers called out to the student, who turned away from the barricade and began to move toward the new voice. “What are we doing here?” the officer asked. No reply. “Do not move!” [After Minneapolis police officer fatally shoots Australian woman, her relatives plead for answers] “Drop it!” someone said finally, as Schultz takes three more steps toward an officer, followed by the report of a gunshot and many screams. Schultz died Sunday at an Atlanta hospital. While the state’s investigative bureau referred to Schultz as a male — “Scott Schultz” — the student and the student’s family used the pronoun “them,” and on the Pride Alliance website Schultz used the description “bisexual, nonbinary and intersex.” “When I’m not running Pride or doing classwork I mostly play D&D and try to be politically active,” Schultz wrote. Bill Schultz said recently that Scout had expressed interest in the anti-fascist political movement and frustration with news coverage of police-involved shootings. “I will say this, that recently Scout has been slightly involved with the anti-fascist community and had expressed a number of anti-fascist ideas to me,” he said. “I tend to think that if there was a cause it might have been anger at the police over all the shootings and all the long litany of police shootings.” In a statement, Pride Alliance called its late president the “driving force” behind the LGBT group for the past two years. “They pushed us to do more events and a larger variety events, and we would not be the organization we are known as without their constant hard work and dedication,” the statement reads. “We love you Scout and we will continue to push for change.” Scout, a fourth-year student at Georgia Tech, was born in Rockville, Md., and spent time in Iowa, Missouri and Florida before moving to the Atlanta area six years ago. Bill Schultz, a retired computer engineer, said Scout came by an interest in engineering earnestly and was scheduled to graduate a semester early. “Scout was definitely a chip off the old block,” he said. Both parents remembered well the time that Scout came out to them. “It wasn’t a shock because we’re welcoming and loving parents,” Bill Schultz said. “It shouldn’t have been hard for Scout to come out but I think there were some issues involved there which is why they did a session in therapy.” Lynne Schultz said that any of Scout’s mental health issues appeared to have been resolved and that friends had told them that Scout seemed fine in recent weeks. “We had no clue that there was an issue in the last four weeks,” she said. Lynne Schultz said that they have received an outpouring of support from members of the community and that more than 30 friends showed up to the hospital in the middle of the night when Scout was shot. “Scout had a lot more friends than I realized,” she said. Bill Schultz said Scout was “all justice for everyone. Now, we have to seek justice for Scout.” “We’re proud of them for standing up for what they believe in,” Lynne Schultz said.

Bristol, the largest city in South West England, has an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church. The construction of the city's Floating Harbour, taking in the wharves on the River Avon and Frome, provided a focus for industrial development and the growth of the local transport infrastructure. Key elements of which include the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads terminus; the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, but is now closed.The 20th century saw further expansion of the city, the growth of the University of Bristol and the arrival of the aircraft industry.

What is the solution?","completion":"Okay little one, let's play a fun game with numbers! We need to find the missing number 'c'. First, let's look at the numbers with 'c' next to each other—1466*c, 981*c, and -896*c. We need to put them together like this: 1466*c + 981*c - 896*c. Now, let's do the addition step by step. 1466 + 981 = 2447. So it becomes 2447*c. Now, we need to take away 896 from 2447. So, 2447 - 896 = 1551. So now we have: 1551*c. Now let's look at our original game: -1371*c = 1551*c - 35064. We need to put -1371*c and 1551*c together by moving the -1371*c to the other side. This looks like: 1551*c - (-1371*c). When we remove a negative number, it's like adding a positive number. So, 1551 + 1371 = 2922. Now we have: 2922*c = 35064. To finish the game and find the missing number 'c', we should divide both sides by 2922. So: c = 35064 / 2922. If we do the division, we find that: c = 12. Yay! We found the missing number!

According to the information provided, alcohol can be sold in retail stores between 9:00 AM (midnight) and 12:00 AM on Sunday. However, it is important to note that the retail establishment must have an additional license to sell alcohol during this time on Sunday. So while alcohol sales are permitted on Sundays, it ultimately depends on whether the specific store you visit has acquired the necessary license to do so."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article with the title: \\"D-Day at 70: Historic photos from the invasion of Normandy\\"","completion":"Title: D-Day at 70: Historic Photos from the Invasion of Normandy Introduction: As we mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day – the largest seaborne invasion in history – we reflect on the bravery and sacrifices made by the Allied forces during World War II. The events of June 6, 1944, played a pivotal role in the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi control, altering the course of the war. In this commemorative article, let's delve into the historic photos that capture the essence of the Invasion of Normandy. Step 1: Collecting and researching historical photos To create a compelling article, it is essential to gather a wide range of high-quality images from reputable sources such as the National Archives or Associated Press. The photographs should reflect various aspects of the D-Day invasion, including preparations, the crossing of the English Channel, and soldiers fighting on the beaches. Additionally, supplemental research about each photo's context should be conducted to provide accurately detailed captions. Step 2: Organizing the photos chronologically To provide a cohesive narrative, the photos should be organized chronologically, starting with the buildup to D-Day and ending with the aftermath. This approach allows readers to follow the progression of the invasion and understand the challenges faced and victories won during this pivotal event. Step 3: Crafting an engaging narrative As the article is comprised primarily of visual elements, the accompanying text should be concise yet informative. Introduce each photo with a brief paragraph that provides historical context and highlights its significance. Additionally, include poignant quotes from the soldiers and veterans who experienced these events firsthand, adding emotional depth to the article. Step 4: Writing detailed captions Besides the introductory paragraph for each photo, detailed captions are crucial to enhance the readers' understanding of the images. The captions should include the date and location of each photograph, along with a description of the depicted events. Furthermore, attribute the source of each photo and mention the photographer if possible. Step 5: Editing and proofreading To ensure the article is informative and engaging, it is essential to review and refine the written content. Verify the accuracy of historical context and captions by cross-referencing your research. Proofread the text for grammatical errors and awkward phrasing to ensure it flows smoothly for the reader. Step 6: Designing the article layout Once the images, paragraphs, and captions are finalized, arrange them in a visually appealing format within the article. Consider using larger images for significant events and moments to emphasize their importance. Step 7: Adding a conclusion To wrap up the article, summarize key points in a conclusion. Reflect on the impact of the D-Day invasion and how the photos provide a unique and stirring glimpse into history. Pay homage to the bravery and heroism of the soldiers who fought on D-Day and remind readers of the importance of remembering and learning from the past. Conclusion: Seventy years later, D-Day remains a powerful reminder of the bravery and sacrifice made by countless men and women during World War II. The historic photos from the Invasion of Normandy not only connect us with the past, but they also inspire us to appreciate those who fought for our freedom. As we mark this significant milestone, let us never forget the heroes who risked their lives to change the course of history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Beck and writer Bill Parker created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in Whiz Comics #2 (cover-dated Feb. 1940), published by Fawcett Comics. The first post-Crisis appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 Legends miniseries. In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the Justice League in Keith Giffen's and J. M. DeMatteis' relaunch of that title. That same year (spinning off from Legends), he was given his own miniseries titled Shazam!: The New Beginning. With this four-issue miniseries, writers Roy and Dann Thomas and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley, and Black Adam into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story. Roy Thomas, a veteran comic book writer and editor, had been lured from Marvel Comics to DC in 1981 with the specific contractual obligation that he would become the main writer of Shazam! and the Justice Society of America characters. Before the Crisis, Thomas wrote several of the DC Comics Presents stories featuring the Marvel Family. The most notable change that the Thomases, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain. This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities. This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story-arc featured in the short-lived anthology Action Comics Weekly #623-626 (October 25, 1988 - November 15, 1988), in which a Neo-Nazi version of Captain Mazi was introduced. At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new Shazam! ongoing series. Though New Beginning had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book, it never saw publication due to editorial disputes between DC Comics and Roy Thomas. As a result, Thomas' intended revival of the Marvel Family with a new punk-styled Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel (aka \\"Spike\\") who was not Billy's sister, and an African-American take on Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr., did not see print. Thomas departed DC in 1989, not long after his removal from the Shazam! project. Other attempts at reviving Shazam! were initiated over the next three years, including a reboot project by John Byrne, illustrator of Legends and writer/artist on the Superman reboot miniseries The Man of Steel (1986). None of these versions saw print, though Captain Marvel, the Wizard Shazam, and Black Adam did appear in DC's War of the Gods miniseries in 1991. By this time, DC had finally ceased the fee-per-use licensing agreement with Fawcett Publications and purchased the full rights to Captain Marvel and the other Fawcett Comics characters. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What else happen in the 1980s","completion":"In the 1980s, after Captain Marvel's first post-Crisis appearance in the 1986 Legends miniseries, he appeared as a member of the Justice League in Keith Giffen's and J.

When this was released, I thought this was one of the most profane films ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films worse, language-wise, than this....but this is a pretty brutal assault on one's ears. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but this got ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard a half-dozen usage's of the Lord's name in vain plus an untold number of f-words. I wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one.

Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the Godly \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson in \\"Gods and Generals.\\" Lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.

Written by David Allison, the series began on 1 May 2009. Hypothesis: Boy Meets Girl won an emmy","completion":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"Boy Meets Girl won an Emmy,\\" we need to analyze the information provided in the context and gather additional relevant data. Context summary: - Boy Meets Girl is an ITV comedy-drama television miniseries. - Stars include Rachael Stirling and Martin Freeman. - The show is centered around Danny Reed (played by Martin Freeman) who experiences a lightning strike and ends up trapped in the body of a woman named Veronica Burton (portrayed by Rachael Stirling). - The series was written by David Allison and premiered on 1 May 2009. Based on this context, we cannot directly conclude whether or not Boy Meets Girl won an Emmy. Additional information: The Emmy Awards are presented by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in the United States. The awards specifically recognize achievements in the television industry. The Emmys are mostly centered around American television shows, so international ones (including those from the UK) may not be relevant to these awards. However, British Television productions have been recognized by The British Academy Television Awards (BAFTA), organized by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, though it is not mentioned in the context whether Boy Meets Girl received any awards or nominations. To ascertain the validity of the hypothesis, a search of reliable sources is required. Upon conducting research, one can find that Boy Meets Girl did not win an Emmy, as it was not nominated for any Emmy Awards. In conclusion, after examining both the context and additional relevant information, we can state that the hypothesis \\"Boy Meets Girl won an Emmy\\" is false. It is important to consider that the context did not provide any information about the show winning or being nominated for any awards, let alone the Emmy Awards. Furthermore, the context focused on describing the plot, actors, and premiere date of Boy Meets Girl, rather than discussing its accolades within the television industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: We discussed earlier some basic principles about the behavior of gases called the kinetic-molecular theory. Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed. I am facing a new situation today: A new volcano is growing underwater. Every few days it has minor lava flow eruptions off the coast of Hawaii. People have actually enjoyed swimming in the water above this newly forming volcano because it is very soothing and relaxing. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Will the speed of molecules increase or decrease as temperature decreases? Answer:","completion":"The speed of molecules will decrease as the temperature decreases. According to the kinetic-molecular theory, the average speed of particles (in this case, the molecules in the water) is dependent upon the temperature. When the temperature is higher, the particles move faster, while lower temperatures result in slower particle movement.

Work began in May 1940 resulting in 13,000,000 cubic yards (9,900,000 m3) of material dredged from the opening of Pearl Harbor to build a channel to Ford Island as well as to create a turning channel around the island. Material was also dredged to deepen the West Loch, East Loch, and Middle Loch for the mooring of battleships. With dredged material used as land fill, the island's size was increased from 334 acres (135 ha) to 441 acres (178 ha).The Navy replaced its PK, F5L, and H16 aircraft with newer models (see table below). In 1933 VP-8F arrived on station, and in 1935 the army bombers had become too large to be maintained and stored at Luke Field. Construction began on a new Army airfield, Hickam Army Airfield, named after pioneer U.S. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam. From 1936 to 1940 Pan American flew its Clipper service into Ford Island, using it as a refueling stop between the United States and Asia. The Navy built a 25,000 boathouse, spent 579,565 on a new crew barracks and built a firehouse, water-supply and lighting systems. In June 1936 the Navy lengthened the island's landing field by 400 feet (120 m), to 3,000 feet (910 m). In March 1937 Amelia Earhart, on her second visit to Luke Field, crashed her Lockheed Electra on takeoff. In 1939, after three years of construction, Hickam Field opened.

Context: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: When did the author appreciate having to shovel snow? Answer: Select from: A). not enough information. B).

It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally.

Nymphs were lively spirits who lived near streams and lakes and protected trees in the forest. Echo had upset the Queen of the Gods; Hera. As a punishment Hera made Echo unable to speak except to repeat the last three words of the person she was talking to. Poor Echo fell in love with Narcissus but could never tell him how she felt. Narcissus teased her and she ran away with tears pouring down her face. Aphrodite, the goddess of love saw what happened and decided to punish Narcissus.

Narcissus stopped eating, lost his beautiful looks and desired to get his love. In the end he anguished gradually and died.

Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community. For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world. Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help. Samake hasn't been to school, but she wants a better future for her five daughters, including Ramatou, 12, and Mariam, 10. \\"When a woman attends school, she will teach what she learns to her children,\\" said Ramatou, who wants to become a doctor. \\"She will also know how to take better care of her family.\\" Build On tries to build schools for grades one to three.

So, the teachers and the principal decided to plan a big fair with many exciting games, colorful decorations, and lots of yummy treats. One beautiful sunny day, the fair finally took place in the school playground. The place was filled with laughter and happy voices of the children. There were big, bright balloons tied to every corner, and colorful banners and flags were waving in the wind. At the fair, there were many games for the children to play. There was a ring toss game, where the kids had to throw small hoops around cute stuffed animals to win them. Another game had children fishing for ducks in a little pond with a small fishing net. And there was also a face painting station, where the kids could turn into their favorite animals, superheroes, or characters. The children also enjoyed riding on a merry-go-round that spun around while playing cheerful music. Some kids took turns bouncing in the big bouncy castle, while others tried their luck at 'knock down the cans' and other games to win bright, shiny prizes. One of the most popular spots at the fair was the snack area, where the children enjoyed sweet cotton candy, crunchy popcorn, and cold lemonade. They also munched on finger-licking good hotdogs and crispy french fries. As the day went on, everybody was having lots of fun. Even the teachers were smiling and laughing as they watched their students running from one game to another, trying their best to win prizes with their little hands. The parents volunteered to supervise the games and serve the treats, making sure that everyone was safe and having a blast. It turned out that hosting a fair instead of a tournament was a fantastic idea. The school playground transformed into a magical land of joy and laughter, where children, teachers, and parents all came together to create wonderful memories that would last forever. And at the end of the day, the sun dipped below the horizon, and the school fair came to a happy close, with everyone leaving with big smiles and hearts full of happiness."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Per the Kremlin, that's the gist of the New Year's message the Russian president sent over to his US counterpart, telling President Trump that a \\"mutual respect\\" is what's needed as \\"a base to develop relations,\\" the AP and AFP report. \\"The development [of] a constructive Russian-US dialogue is particularly important for strengthening strategic stability in the world and finding the optimal answers to global threats and challenges,\\" Putin is said to have added. The AP notes that Putin's message comes at a time when relations between the US and Russia are the worst since the Cold War era, in part due to Russia's occupation of Crimea and its interference in the US election. Putin also sent end-of-year correspondence to French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, expressing \\"sincere hope that key changes for the better will continue in Syria in the new year\\" and vowing to \\"show all kind of support\\" to Syria in its efforts to \\"protect its state sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity.\\" Expand this summary.","completion":"Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, is entering the new year with a sense of optimism regarding the future of US-Russia relations. He hopes that both countries will be able to maintain a pragmatic cooperation that will enable them to work together towards shared goals. In a New Year's message to US President Donald Trump, Putin emphasized the importance of mutual respect and constructive dialogue as the foundation for developing the relationship between the two nations. Putin's message comes at a time when the relationship between the United States and Russia is at its lowest point since the Cold War era. This is mainly due to Russia's controversial annexation of Crimea and its alleged interference in the US presidential elections, which has led to numerous sanctions and diplomatic expulsions on both sides. Despite these setbacks, Putin believes that strengthening strategic stability around the world and finding optimal solutions to global threats and challenges would be possible through a constructive Russian-US dialogue. In addition to his message to President Trump, Putin also sent end-of-year correspondence to other global leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Among these communications, Putin expressed his sincere hope for positive changes in Syria in the new year. He assured that Russia would continue to support Syria's efforts to protect its state sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. The Russian president's New Year's message indicates a willingness to improve relations with the United States and potentially seek common ground on various global issues. While it remains to be seen if President Trump will reciprocate Putin's sentiments, these messages demonstrate that there is still hope for improved diplomatic relations between the two countries. To achieve this goal, both nations would need to work collaboratively, addressing contentious issues such as cyber security, arms control, and the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Additionally, it would be crucial for Russia and the United States to foster a relationship built on trust and transparency to mitigate any potential setbacks that may arise from miscommunication or misunderstandings. In conclusion, Vladimir Putin's New Year's message to President Trump and other global leaders signifies a desire to reestablish positive relationships in the global community, particularly with the United States. Despite the current state of diplomatic relations, President Putin remains hopeful that both nations can move toward a pragmatic cooperation that will benefit not only Russia and the United States, but also the entire world. By addressing global threats and challenges together, the two countries can potentially have a significant impact on the future of international relations and stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The word \\"Vollnarkose\\" means general or full anaesthesia. \\"steht in der Praxis ein qualifiziertes und erfahrenes Anästhesieteam zur Verfügung\\" means \\"a qualified and experienced anesthetic team is available in the practice\\". The phrase \\"ein qualifiziertes und erfahrenes Anästhesieteam\\" refers to \\"a qualified and experienced anesthesia team\\", while \\"zur Verfügung\\" is used to indicate that something is \\"available\\" or \\"at your disposal\\". \\"In der Praxis\\" simply translates to \\"in the practice\\". German, like many other European languages, tends to structure sentences longer and more complex than in English and it's not uncommon for words to be arranged in a manner that may seem unusual or awkward when translated literally into English. This is due to the differences in grammar rules between the two languages. Therefore, when translating a sentence from English to German, it's important to not only translate the words, but to also adapt the sentence structure to fit the grammatical rules of German. English to German translations also require a deep understanding of the subtleties and nuances of both languages, taking into consideration the cultural context and the connotations that specific words may have. For instance, a word that means one thing in English might have slightly different implications or connotations in German.

A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words to clarify or explain the original content. In this case, both sentences convey similar ideas but have a slight difference in meaning. Sentence 1: \\"Jane manages to survive and Michael finally loses her virginity.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"finally\\" suggests that there has been an ongoing or continuous effort or expectation for Michael to lose her virginity, and Jane's survival plays a role in this event. The emphasis is on the fact that the action has taken place after a considerable amount of time or effort.

It states that Jane survives and Michael loses her virginity but does not indicate any previous expectations or efforts concerning this event. Therefore, the answer is (A). No, the two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other.

The answer to the question: What did Bernard's band rename itself in 1978? is inside the article: On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August..., can you guess it ?

The six workers and one volunteer were travelling in a four-vehicle convoy in the north of the country when the attackers blocked their path and opened fire, according to Syria state media. They had been delivering medical supplies in the Idlib province when the abduction took place near the town of Saraqeb, at around 11.30am local time. Danger: The kidnapped people were members of the Red Cross who were working in Syria (file picture) Help: The people, who have not been identified, has been delivering medical supplies in the Idlib province in northern Syria. Treatment: A spokesman has called for the immediate release of the workers, saying they are urgently needed to help the people of Syria. The Syrian media reports blamed the attack on 'terrorists' - a term often used to describe the rebels fighting President Bashar Assad. The Idlib area has been largely under rebel control for the past year. A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross today confirmed that the people had been kidnapped, but that they had not been contacted by anybody claiming responsibility. The organisation has called for their immediate release. Ewan Watson said: 'I am able to confirm that six ICRC staff. members and one Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteer have been abducted. near Idlib in northwestern Syria. War-torn: The kidnapping took place in the dangerous Idlib province. 'We. are calling for their immediate and unconditional release of this team. which was delivering humanitarian assistance to those most in need - and. we do that on both sides of the front lines.' The Red Cross has not offered any information about the gender of nationality of the six employees who were captured. However, a spokesman said that the team had been in the field since 10 October to assess the medical situation in the area and to look at how to provide medical aid in the province, which is said to be: 'by definition is a difficult area to go in.' News of the kidnapping came as further. violence erupted in the Syrian capital, Damascus, where state media. also reported that its own headquarters in the city's Umayyad Square were damaged by two car bombs. It is not known whether there are any casualties. Kidnappings. have become a common feature of the ongoing conflict in northern Syria,. where fighting between government and rebel soldiers is still fierce. Aid workers and foreign journalists are at particular risk of abduction. The. war, which has torn apart the Middle-Eastern country, has so far. claimed more than 100,000 lives and has created 2.1million refugees. Conflict: The fighting in Syria continues to rage, and two car bombs reportedly exploded in Damascus this evening (file photo) Gunfire: Armed men, whom Syrian state media suggested were rebel fighters, opened fire on the Red Cross convoy today (file photo) Ravaged: Areas all over the country have been affected by the conflict. It has been a conflict of particular brutality, with the international Human Rights Watch organisation last week accusing rebel forces of killing 190 civilians and taking 200 hostages in a single attack earlier this year. People around the world were particularly horrified by reports of a chemical weapons attack in August which killed an estimated 1,400 people. Following international pressure, a team of inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons were sent into the country to oversee the destruction of the Syrian government's chemical weapon supply. Inspection: Footage allegedly showing the OPCW working in Syria was aired last week. Unknown: The broadcast, from Syrian TV, shows the inspectors at an unspecified location in Syria. The team, which was this week awarded the Nobel peace prize for their work, entered the country at the beginning of the month, and was reportedly filmed starting work on President Assad's stockpiled munitions. The conflict has claimed more than 100,000 lives and driven more than 2.1million refugees out of their shattered homeland. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Since his kids were growing up, he and his wife wanted to make some changes to the house. They decided to knock down their living room wall to open up the space. When the wooden walls were moved, they were shocked to find a lizard stuck in the small space between the walls.

Please answer the following question: Question: Why do people take up running? Options: - shortness of breath - weight loss - faster travel - stitches - heart attack Explain why a human would choose \\"weight loss\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"weight loss\\" to answer the question above because running is a form of aerobic exercise that helps in burning calories and shedding excess body weight. Let's break down the explanation step-by-step: 1. Aerobic exercise: Running is an aerobic exercise that increases heart rate and oxygen intake, stimulating the cardiovascular system and improving overall fitness. 2. Calorie burning: Running engages large muscle groups like the legs and core, which require energy to function. As a result, the body burns calories while running, contributing to weight loss. 3. Long-term benefits: Consistent running is known to help maintain a healthy weight over time through the continuous burning of calories. 4. Comparing with the other options: - \\"shortness of breath\\" and \\"stitches\\" are temporary and uncomfortable conditions that may result from running, but they aren't reasons for taking up running. - \\"faster travel\\" might be a minor benefit or motivation for some people, but it's not the primary reason most people take up running. Also, for longer distances or daily commuting, other means of transportation are much faster. - \\"heart attack\\" is an unlikely reason for taking up running, as running aims to improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of heart attacks. Given all these factors, weight loss emerges as the primary reason why a human would choose to take up running among the given options. This is because running provides a proven and efficient way to burn calories, maintain a healthy weight, and improve overall health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the imbalance of ocean mass fluxes. After the volcano eruption, evaporation over ocean becomes lower, because it is largely determined by the ocean skin temperature change. The quick response of evaporation to the surface cooling and the delayed response of river runoff to the associated lower precipitation lead to an increased sea level. About 1~2 years later, river discharge becomes less due to the reduced precipitation and less sea ice melting, which cause sea level to drop.[9] Now, I have a new situation: In the beginning of year 1000 mount Etna had a huge volcanic eruption.

Queen's Park Football Club is a Scottish football club based in Glasgow. The club is currently the only fully amateur club in the Scottish Professional Football League; its amateur status is reflected by its Latin motto, Ludere Causa Ludendi - \\"to play for the sake of playing\\". Queen's Park is the oldest association football club in Scotland, having been founded in 1867, and is the oldest outside England and Wales. Queen's Park is also the only Scottish football club to have played in the FA Cup Final, achieving this feat in both 1884 and 1885. The 1975-76 season saw the reconstruction of the Scottish Leagues and Queen's entered the Second Division. Coinciding with this, Queen's appointed a head coach for the first time. Davie McParland led Queen's to 4th place but left at the end of the season to join Partick Thistle. Joe Gilroy was his successor and Queen's finished 5th, 7th and 13th under his guidance before his departure at the end of 1978-79 season. Former player Eddie Hunter took charge and within two seasons, Queen's had been promoted as 1980-81 champions. The talent in the side was obvious. Derek Atkins was an ever-present in goal, John McGregor a high scoring defender and Jimmy Nicholson and Gerry McCoy netted a combined tally of 28 goals. Much of the side was inexperienced, with full-back Bobby Dickson one of the few who had been a mainstay in previous years. After a highly respectable finish of 8th the following season, Queen's finished bottom and were relegated in 1983. The main reason for this was the loss of some of the players who had won Queen's promotion. In particular, John McGregor and Alan Irvine departed, leaving for Liverpool and Everton respectively. During the same season, Queen's lost 2-1 to Rangers at Hampden in the Scottish Cup quarter-finals. Recovery took a while but eventually a good side featuring Stevie Ross, Kenny Brannigan, Ian McCall and Ross Caven finished 4th in 1985-86 - winning three more games than the Championship side of 1981. Queen's lost narrowly by 2-1 at Celtic Park in the 4th round of the Scottish Cup in the February 1986. 1987-88 was a further improvement but 21 victories was only enough for 3rd place. 1990-91 was another season of frustration as Queen's squandered a chance for promotion after having been in contention for so long and finished 5th, only four points behind 2nd place Montrose.

With 7 seconds left in the 1st half, the Eagles attempted to go up 13-0 with a field goal, instead, the kick was blocked and returned 71 yards by Kevin Dockery for a Giants touchdown. That cut the lead to 10-7. Early in the third quarter, Donovan McNabb found Brian Westbrook for a 40-yard Eagles touchdown that increased their lead to 17-7. Philadelphia would score again in the 3rd with a 34-yard field goal by David Akers. The Giants would score on a 1-yard pass from Eli Manning to Darcy Johnson with 20 seconds left in the game, but couldn't recover an onside kick and the Eagles won the game.

In the first quarter, we see that there was 1 field goal by David Akers. Now, looking at the second quarter, we notice that nobody scored a field goal.

But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County. This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets.

With energy and boundlessness they go and go and go. They mention the \\"thing\\" that they're apparently going to and how it should be there somewhere. They have no map.

Michael Lee Alfonso (January 24, 1965 - February 17, 2007) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his appearances with the American professional wrestling promotions Extreme Championship Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation under the ring name Mike Awesome and for his appearances in Japan for with Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling as The Gladiator. Alfonso achieved the biggest success of his career in FMW as The Gladiator, where he became a three-time world champion, with two reigns as Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion and one reign as Independent Heavyweight Champion. His second Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship reign from 1996-1997 was the longest reign in the title's history, lasting for 489 days. In 1993, Alfonso appeared in NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) for a short period (as \\"Awesome\\" Mike Awesome) before returning to FMW. On February 5, 1994 at ECW's event, The Night the Line was Crossed, Awesome nearly injured wrestler, J.T. Smith when he performed a high-risk dive to the outside of the ring. Smith's back was folded backwards against the guard rail during the impact. This spot appeared in many ECW highlight reels including the intro to a variety of their television programs for years to come. (according to ECW announcer Joey Styles his own reaction to the spot inspired his \\"Oh my God\\" catchphrase). In 1995 he made a one night appearance in ECW with The Triple Threat in addressing The Masked Man ( Rick Rude). In January 1998, Awesome began appearing for ECW again and continued his feud with Masato Tanaka in the United States. Awesome began in ECW by losing to Tanaka on an episode ECW's weekly Hardcore TV. However, following the match, he delivered an Awesome Bomb to Tanaka over the top rope through a table set up on the outside. In his final appearance of his second ECW stint, Awesome lost to Tanaka again at the August Heat Wave pay-per-view event. Almost immediately upon arriving in ECW for his third stint in September 1999, he shocked the wrestling world by winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at Anarchy Rulz by defeating the reigning champion Taz and nemesis Masato Tanaka in a three-way dance, which was signed on the spot. Awesome continued to be a major factor in ECW early in 2000, including teaming with Raven to beat Tanaka and Tommy Dreamer for the ECW World Tag Team Championship. He gained a new manager, Judge Jeff Jones, whom managed Awesome to the top of winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship twice in 1999.

Do cats rub their faces against people more if they go for several days without showering? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is about the consequences of rubbing a cat's fur in the wrong direction, while the second question is about cats' behavior in response to humans who haven't showered for several days. 1. Why should you never rub a cat's fur the wrong way? Rubbing a cat's fur the wrong way can lead to several adverse outcomes for both the cat and the person engaging in the behavior: a. Discomfort: Rubbing a cat's fur in the opposite direction disrupts the natural alignment of the hair shafts, leading to discomfort for the animal. Cats maintain a specific hair structure for a variety of reasons, including insulation, protection, and facilitating their grooming process. Disrupting this structure can cause irritation and stress for the cat. b. Stress and Anxiety: Cats are sensitive creatures that rely on their environment, routine, and the people in their lives for a sense of security. An action that causes discomfort or pain, such as rubbing their fur the wrong way, increases their stress and anxiety levels. This can lead to behavior changes, such as aggression, hiding, or overgrooming. c. Aggression: A cat that feels threatened or uncomfortable might respond aggressively in an attempt to protect itself. This could involve biting, scratching, or hissing at the person causing the disturbance. Thus, rubbing a cat's fur the wrong way could lead to injuries or escalating tensions between the animal and its owner. d. Damage to the coat: Repeatedly rubbing a cat's fur in the wrong direction can cause damage to its coat. This may result in hair breakage, tangling, or matting, which compromises the cat's overall health and well-being. 2. Do cats rub their faces against people more if they go for several days without showering? When cats rub their faces against people, they engage in a behavior called \\"bunting.\\" Bunting serves several purposes: a. Scent-marking: Cats have scent glands on various parts of their bodies, including their cheeks. When they rub their faces against objects or people, they deposit pheromones, which are chemical signals that communicate information to other cats or identify territories. A person who has not showered for several days has a stronger odor, which might prompt a cat to engage in bunting more frequently to reinforce its scent mark on that individual. b. Affection: Cats express their affection for people by rubbing their faces against them. They may do this more frequently with someone they have a strong bond with or feel comfortable around. The showering habits of a person may not necessarily influence this behavior, as long as the cat remains familiar with the individual and their scent. c. Comfort-seeking: Some cats may find the scent of their surroundings or people comforting. If a person hasn't showered for a few days, their scent will be more pronounced, which could make the cat feel more at ease and prompt it to engage in bunting behavior more frequently. However, it is essential to note that individual cats have distinct personalities, preferences, and reactions. Some cats may not react differently to a person who hasn't showered, while others may increase their bunting behavior. Observing your cat's specific habits and reactions is crucial to understanding its needs and maintaining a healthy relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: The koala dashed up the palm tree so fast, but couldn't grasp the cactus well. The cactus was (A) more smooth (B) less smooth A:","completion":"The cactus was (B) less smooth. When comparing a palm tree and a cactus, it is important to consider their distinctive features and how they would affect an animal like a koala attempting to climb them. Let's take a closer look at both plants to understand this better. Palm trees are characterized by their tall, straight trunks, which are relatively uniform in texture, and their feathery, frond-like leaves that extend from the top. The trunk of a palm tree is relatively smooth with only minor inconsistencies in texture, such as the horizontal markings left by fallen leaves. This surface offers a koala the necessary support and grip to climb quickly, allowing them to ascend with ease. On the other hand, cacti are a type of plant that is native to arid regions. They have evolved to retain moisture in their thick stems. Many species of cacti have spines, which are specialized leaves that help them protect their water-rich flesh from hungry animals. These spines may vary in number, size, and density, depending on the specific type of cactus, but in general, they create a rough, prickly surface that poses a significant challenge to any creature attempting to climb or grip it. In the given scenario, the koala dashed up the palm tree swiftly because it could manage the smooth trunk with minimal difficulty. However, as it attempted to grasp the cactus, it likely faced two major challenges. First, the cactus' spines would have made it considerably more difficult for the koala to find a comfortable grip that did not result in injury. Second, cacti's surfaces, in general, are more irregular in shape and texture compared to the cylindrical and even-textured trunk of a palm tree. In summary, the cactus was (B) less smooth, making it more challenging for the koala to grasp and climb. This difference in texture between the palm tree and the cactus is due to their particular adaptations that enable them to survive in their respective environments, which impacts accessibility for creatures like koalas that attempt to interact with them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: I live in a town. In the past, the air wasn't fresh. There was a river. People put rubbish in it. The water went bad. The fishes in the river died. There was much rubbish in the streets which weren't wide. It smelt terrible. People lived in low old houses with trees all around and had a terrible life. The children couldn't have many chances to go out to cities, not to say, have a good education. Farmers worked only with their hands. They worked very hard all year round. They planted crops with the help of animals. The poor people went anywhere on foot, and only some rode bikes. Few visitors came here to spend their holidays. At present, things have been greatly changed. People have moved into big bright houses or beautiful buildings. There is a big factory. Many people work in it. They are getting richer. Different kinds of cars and buses are running in the big streets. It is faster and easier to travel. People plant many fruit trees and get much money. People plant crops with the help of machines which can save lots of work. Students can study in a modem school. People pay more attention to the environmental protection. The mountains are becoming greener, water much cleaner. What around us is the clearer sky and greener water. As a result, many visitors come here to spend their holidays.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Most historical fiction begins with a focus on an exact time period and location. You should consider a time period that you are interested in or curious about as well as a location within that time period that might be interesting to readers. Be specific when you choose a time period and location, as the more specific you are, the more specific your research will be. This will allow you to uncover fascinating historical details about the time period and location that you can then use in your fiction. For example, rather than choose, “20th century, France,\\" you may choose “1935, Paris.\\" Or, rather than choose “18th century America,\\" you may choose to focus on “1776, Philadelphia.\\" The first place you can go to for research is your local library. Talk to the reference librarian about your specific time period and location. Ask him or her for possible texts that can help you get a better sense of everyday life in the era. Look for encyclopedias that focus on specific time periods and locations. You can also look up biographies of historical figures who were alive during the time period. You can read scholarly texts that focus on specific elements of the time period and location, such as what people ate in 1776, Philadelphia or how people dined out in 1935, Paris. You may be able to lean on historical texts that delve deep into the everyday customs and practices of the time. You can also see if your local library has catalogues, magazines, and newspapers from the time period and location. Often, libraries will have these resources on microfilm, allowing you to browse through the news stories, trends, and talk of the day. Magazines and catalogues can be a useful way to get a sense of how people were writing, talking, and gossiping during your chosen time period. You can also notice any popular slang or terms from the time period and the more popular products consumed by people during the time period. You may need to expand your research practices to discussions with professionals who are experts in a certain time period and location. You can find these experts by searching for the authors of historical texts online or by talking to other professionals in the field. You should then contact them and ask for a meeting about specific details that will help you create a more believable historical world for your story. You should look for experts that are very proficient in a certain aspect of the time period, such as an expert in embroidery in 17th century America or an expert in the origins of horse racing in 19th century Paris. This will then allow you to ask them very specific questions about the time period and get specific answers in return. You can also ask experts to refer you to other experts they may know, creating a network of experts for you to lean on as you write your story. Using experts for different elements of your story will ensure you are getting an informed opinion and make your story feel more authentic. In our current digital age, it may seem more convenient and efficient to search for historical information online. However, you should do so with caution, as information on the internet is not always accurate or vetted by experts in the field. Do not assume that just because information is in an online encyclopedia or has been verified in some way by only one expert, it is correct. The internet can be a good place to get inspired and acquire some basic background information on your chosen time period. But it should not be your sole method of research. You should fact check all the information you get online with scholarly texts and discussions with history experts. Try to verify the information from the internet with other outside sources so you are sure you are using historical fact that you can then transform into fiction.","completion":"The article explains how to research and write historical fiction by being specific about the time period and location, using resources like libraries and experts for accurate information, and fact-checking details found online."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey.

The previous owners did not register the extension with Land Registry. Planning permission for garage extension and driveway was granted in 1984. Battle with council could cost Ashdowns thousands of pounds of savings.","completion":"Title: The Ashdowns' Saga: A Gripping Encounter With Bureaucracy Over an Unregistered House Extension In 1986, Janet and Barry Ashdown embarked on a new chapter of their life when they became homeowners in Holderness, East Yorkshire. The charming house they purchased had one particular attraction that stood out: a commodious extended double garage, perfectly suited to fit their needs. However, little did they know, this asset would later result in unexpected trials and tribulations that could potentially cost them thousands of pounds from their savings. The former owners, it appears, had applied for and been granted planning permission in 1984 for the extension of the garage and the driveway. Despite undertaking this procedural task compliantly, they glaringly omitted an equally crucial aspect - they failed to reflect this extension in the Land Registry. When the Ashdowns purchased the house, this oversight was, unfortunately for them, not made apparent. The issue erupted into a full-blown quandary when the omission was eventually noticed. Faced with a situation both unexpected and unwanted, the Ashdowns found themselves in a bitter standoff with the local council over the unregistered extension. An innocent escapade into the world of homeownership had led them into what appeared to be a bureaucratic battleground. One may ask, how important is registering a property extension? The ramifications of not doing so have become harshly apparent through the Ashdowns' experience. Registering a property, or modifications thereof, is an integral part of the legal process that guarantees the rights of a homeowner. It provides crucial evidence of the ownership of an area and of alterations to it, which, as the Ashdowns have discovered, can hold significant implications in dealing with local authorities. The saga has become a financial tempest for the Ashdowns. An ordeal that they should have been insulated against threatens to rob them of their hard-earned savings. Indeed, the legal fees and expenses associated with rectifying this oversight could run into thousands of pounds. Beyond the monetary costs, the stress and anxiety induced by this situation are immeasurable. This predicament stands as a stark reminder of the potential pitfalls faced by new homeowners. Diligence is a rugged shield against such mishaps. A thorough examination of property deeds and the details held in the Land Registry should be fundamental steps in the home buying process. Moreover, it highlights the importance of getting planning permissions and necessary certificates correctly registered by property owners to avoid future disputes or difficulties of such nature. As the Ashdowns grapple with this challenging situation, their tale serves as both a cautionary tale and stark learning for homeowners and prospective buyers. It underscores the intrinsic importance of property registration and the potentially huge financial consequences of neglecting this crucial legal process. The couple's plight draws attention to the necessity of adhering to all procedures surrounding property acquisition, as one never knows when an aspect considered unimportant could snowball into a major crisis. The Ashdowns' saga continues, a testament to the harsh realities that can be encountered in the world of homeownership. As they brace against the pending financial blow, their tale resonates as a firm reminder that the fine print should never be overlooked in property transactions. Life has a way of teaching lessons that are often overlooked, and unfortunately for the Ashdowns, theirs came in the form of an extended double garage."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you are given a medical question pair hand-generated.

His energetic Grammy Norma secretly tells Ted the legend of the Once-ler, who will tell anyone about trees if they brought him fifteen cents, a nail, and a shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail. When Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, he discovers that the outside world is a contaminated, empty wasteland. Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his way home, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Mr. Aloysius O'Hare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled oxygen to Thneedville residents. O'Hare explains to Ted that because trees produce oxygen free of charge, he considers it a threat to his business whenever he hears people talking about them. After revealing that he has \\"security camera eyes\\" all over the city, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town. However, Ted continues to sneak out of O'Hare's sight (with his grandmother's encouragement) and learns more of the trees' history.

A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. If more pollution occurs, it leads to the release of more greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) into the atmosphere. These gases trap more heat, which would normally be radiated back to space, causing global warming. The direct effect of increased pollution is the additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which trap more heat and thus contribute to global warming. The indirect effects include the potential alteration of climate patterns, melting of polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and harm to ecosystems and biodiversity.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Legal Services Corp. (LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs Question: \\"What organization did Congress approve restriction on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take?\\" Response: \\"LSC\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response accurately answers the question. The question is asking about the organization on which Congress imposed restrictions regarding the type of cases that federally funded legal aid attorneys can take on. According to the information in the preceding paragraph, this organization is the Legal Services Corp. (LSC). Created in the 1970s, the LSC has a primary mission of providing legal assistance to individuals of limited financial means. However, in 1996, amid criticism from conservatives who believed the LSC was disproportionately supporting liberal causes or politically sensitive cases, Congress imposed various restrictions (Public Law 104-134) on the kind of work that LSC-funded attorneys could engage in. More specifically, following these restrictions, lawyers receiving funding through the LSC were prohibited from engaging in a range of activities, which included lobbying legislature, filing class-action lawsuits, taking part in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, and defending public housing tenants charged with drug-related offenses. Despite the financial challenges and constraints imposed by these restrictions, the LSC has continued its operations, largely funded through federal appropriations. The annual budget - which pays for legal representation in civil cases for clients in situations such as domestic violence and child custody disputes - has fluctuated over the years. In 2003, President George W. Bush proposed a budget of 329 million for the LSC, the same amount allocated in the two previous years. Thus, while the constraints have certainly shaped the work that LSC-funded attorneys can do, the organization continues to provide crucial legal services to individuals whose incomes do not exceed 125 percent of the federal poverty level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
