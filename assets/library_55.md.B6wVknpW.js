(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Three young American tourists, Alex (Josh Duhamel), his sister Bea (Olivia Wilde), and a friend Amy (Beau Garrett), are backpacking in Brazil. They decide to go by bus and visit parts of the country instead of flying directly to the Northeastern beaches they wish to visit. After a bus crash leaves all the passengers stranded, they are joined by two English men, Finn (Desmond Askew) and Liam (Max Brown), and an Australian woman, Pru (Melissa George), who is fluent in Portuguese. The group find a cabana bar where several other tourists and locals are partying. After spending the day on the beach, they are served drugged drinks and pass out. The next morning, they awaken on the deserted beach, robbed of their luggage, money, and documents. Looking for help in the nearby village, they encounter conflict with locals as they see some of their belongings worn or lying around. Offering help, Kiko (Agles Steib), a local who speaks some English, volunteers to take them to an isolated cabin in the forest, where they can wait for help. In a long walk through the wilderness, Kiko shows them a âsecret\\" cave beneath a waterfall, but, taking a bad dive into the river, Kiko hits the rocky bottom, and is rendered unconscious and begins bleeding profusely from a cut in his head. Proceeding to the cabin in the jungle, they find food, clothes, and a number of prescription drugs, as well as a drawer filled with other peopleâs passports. They manage to heal Kiko's wound and reluctantly decide to spend the night at the cabin.

You can cut them into wedges a little larger than the onions. These peppers are so hot that they will irritate your skin. Always wear kitchen gloves when handling them. Slice off the stems, then cut the peppers from side to side. Divide them into slices a little bigger than the onions. You don’t have to remove the seeds. Be careful of any lingering pepper juice. Wash it off when get the chance. Avoid touching your eyes. Place a pan on the stove and add the oil to it. Olive oil is a common choice, but other cooking oils may be used instead. Turn on the stove to let the pan heat until the oil is hot. When the oil is hot, it glistens. It flows smoothly if you tip the pan. It should not smoke, so if you see smoke, move the pan off the heat. Canola oil is a standard replacement for olive oil. It has less flavor. Other vegetable oils, including corn oil or peanut oil, may also be used. Add the 3 ingredients you cut earlier, stirring them with a spoon to coat them in oil. The heat softens the ingredients and begins drawing out their flavor. Measure out the liquids and pour them into the pot. Also add the salt to season the sauce. Reduce the heat to a medium-low setting. The sauce should gently bubble, indicating that you have it at the right temperature. Leave the pot on the stove, uncovered, for 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes are up, remove the pan from the heat. For safety, let the sauce sit on the stove for about 5 minutes. The open your food processor and pour the ingredients into it. Turn on the processor to break down the ingredients into a smooth sauce. Use resealable hot sauce bottles or mason jars to hold the sauce. Make sure the jars have been thoroughly washed and disinfected. Pour the sauce into a funnel placed on top of the bottles, then let the bottles cool, uncovered, on the counter.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.

The 2013-14 squad photograph has a few faces that are still lurking around the Old Trafford corridors - such as Marouane Fellaini and Anderson - but who's been ushered towards the exit? The team photo from September 26, 2013 tells all. Louis van Gaal has stripped and sold the scraps for parts in what appears to be an exciting new attacking era for those in the red half of Manchester. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here. A total of 17 players or staff have left the club since the beginning of the 2013-14 season under David Moyes - United finished seventh in the Premier League. Back row: Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Marouane Fellaini, Rio Ferdinand, Michael Carrick, Robin van Persie. Third Row: Masseur Garry Armer, performance analyst Paul Brand, head of fitness Tony Strudwick, Antonio Valencia, Darren Fletcher, Wilfried Zaha, Adnan Januzaj, Fabio da Silva, masseur Rod Thornley, kit Manager Alec Wylie, physio Neil Hough. Second Row: Assistant kit manager Ian Buckingham, physio Rob Swire, Dr Steve McNally, Alexander Buttner, Sam Johnstone, Anders Lindegaard, David de Gea, Ben Amos, Ashley Young, coach Phil Neville, masseur Andy Caveney, goalkeeping coach Chris Woods. Front Row: Shinji Kagawa, Rafael da Silva, Anderson, Nani, assistant Manager Steve Round, Ryan Giggs, manager David Moyes, Nemanja Vidic, coach Jimmy Lumsden, Patrice Evra, Javier \\"Chicharito\\" Hernandez, Tom Cleverley and Wayne Rooney. Danny Welbeck (back row, far left) The striker was sick of playing second fiddle to Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Co and joined Arsenal for £16million in a deadline-day move. Under Moyes, he averaged just 58 minutes per game. Danny Welbeck left Manchester United for Arsenal in a £16million, described as the 'bargain of the century' Rio Ferdinand (back row, third from right) The defender makes a tasty return to Old Trafford on Sunday with Queens Park Rangers and will be told to try and contain Radamel Falcao and United's new attacking line-up. Former England international Ferdinand turned down two other London clubs in favour of joining Harry Redknapp at Loftus Road. Veteran defender Rio Ferdinand will line up for Queens Park Rangers against his former club at Old Trafford on Sunday. Wilfried Zaha (third row, sixth from right) Zaha never truly got going at United, making just two Premier League appearances, and the winger was given permission to return to Crystal Palace, a club he helped win promotion to the top flight in 2013, on a season-long loan. Fabio da Silva (third row, fourth from right) Now on the books of Cardiff City, the full-back left United after spending a year on loan at QPR. In his six years in Manchester, Fabio managed just 22 Premier League appearances, compared with his brother, Rafael, who has broken the 100 mark. Fabio da Silva marks Wilfried Zaha and the pair are both no longer at Manchester United. Alexander Buttner (second row, fourth from left) Buttner joined Dynamo Moscow after spending two years with United. The 25-year-old left for £4.4m, having made just 13 Premier League appearances and scoring twice. Van Gaal deemed Buttner surplus to requirements following the signing of Luke Shaw from Southampton. Alexander Buttner moved from Manchester United to Dynamo Moscow after two years at Old Trafford. Coach Phil Neville (second row, third from right) Former Everton defender Neville was reunited with Moyes at United, becoming the first-team coach. The 37-year-old is now concentrating on his career as a pundit for the BBC, and following in the footsteps of his brother, Gary. Phil Neville walks with Ryan Giggs at Old Trafford but only the latter remains at Manchester United. Shinji Kagawa (front row, far left) Kagawa was never loved at Old Trafford the same way he was at Borussia Dortmund and the attacking midfielder returned to the Bundesliga club for £6.3m on a four-year contract. Nani (front row, fourth from left) Nani left to join former club Sporting Lisbon on a season-long loan and, in his own way, helped with the arrival of Marcos Rojo. Nani made 147 appearances in the Premier League and scored 25 goals. Shinji Kagawa laughs with Nani in the background during the pair's time together at Manchester United. Assistant manager Steve Round (front row, fifth from left) The departure of Moyes caused a ripple effect which was felt by his back-room staff. Round, United's assistant manager during the year they finished seventh, was relieved of his duties. Manager David Moyes (front row, centre) United did not qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 19 years and the Old Trafford club had never finished outside of the Premier League top three before. Both records were smashed. The former Everton boss and his coaching staff were paid £5.2m compensation for the sacking. Manchester United assistant manager Steve Round (left) left Manchester United with David Moyes (centre) Nemanja Vidic (front row, sixth from right) After eight years at the club and five Premier League titles - not to mention a Champions League win - Vidic decided enough was enough. The centre-back joined Inter Milan after seeing out his contract. Nemanja Vidic spent eight years at Manchester United and won five Premier League titles during his stint. Coach Jimmy Lumsden (front row, fifth from right) Another to suffer the same fate as Moyes. Lumsden parted company with the club at the same time as assistant manager Round after it all fell apart at Old Trafford. Patrice Evra (front row, fourth from right) After a mammoth 273 Premier League appearances, Evra joined Serie A club Juventus on a two-year deal. The fee was £1.2m for the 33-year-old, who now seems destined to see out his career in Italy. Patrice Evra moved to Serie A club Juventus after 273 Premier League appearances for Manchester United. Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez (front row, third from right) Hernandez was surplus to requirements up front and fell behind in the pecking order, particularly with the arrival of Radamel Falcao. The striker joined Real Madrid on a season-long loan and the Spanish giants have the option to buy at the end of the deal. Javier Hernandez became surplus to requirements at Manchester United and fell behind the pecking order. Mexico international Javier Hernandez joined Real Madrid on a one-year loan deal with an option to buy. Tom Cleverley (front row, second from right) Cleverley has been in and out of Manchester since 2009, taking in loans at Leicester, Watford and Wigan, and the midfielder has joined Aston Villa for another temporary spell. The 25-year-old would have warmed the bench with Ander Herrera, Angel di Maria and Daley Blind arriving as summer signings. Everton attempted to sign Tom Cleverely on deadline day but the midfielder joined Aston Villa. Tom Cleverley avoided warming the bench at Manchester United by joining Aston Villa late on deadline day. And the rest:. Chris Woods - goalkeeping coach - Woods was told alongside Phil Neville that he would no longer be needed at the club after Moyes' departure in May. Rob Swire - physio - retired in July after being at Manchester United since 1999. He was replaced by assistant Neil Hough. VIDEO Falcao wants long-term United stay.

Village farmers in Turkey have launched what could be the latest trend in wearable technology: solar powered donkeys. A group of forward-thinking herdsmen in the province of İzmir, Western Turkey, wanted to find a way to stay online on their long, lonely farming trips. What better way, they thought, than to use the latest in cutting edge renewables and transport it on their trusty drove of donkeys. Scroll down for video. Donkey work: Village farmers in Turkey (pictured) have launched what could be the latest trend in wearable technology: solar powered donkeys.

Farmers walks alongside the animal to help steady the solar panel, which can generate between five to seven kilowatts of energy. When the farmers reach their destination, a man sits in the shade cast by the panel and opens his laptop to check the latest news online. Now that's an ass-et! In footage from Ruptly news agency, the farmers are shown attaching large solar panels to a donkey to power their mobile devices. Here a farmer leads the power-generating donkey along a dusty trail. The farmers also claim that during birthing season, the panels are particularly helpful in providing extra lighting. A group of forward-thinking herdsmen in the province of İzmir, Western Turkey, wanted to find a way to stay online on their long, lonely trips. Mobile phones only use around two to six watts when charging, so in the right conditions, the panel will have enough energy to charge over 1000 mobile phones. Shunning the simple life, the Turkish herdsman can now stay online, updating Facebook and catching up on the latest episode of Breaking Bad. The farmers also claim that during birthing season, the panels are particularly helpful in providing extra lighting. Ser-Gün, a Turkish solar panel producer, is behind the ‘plug and play’ panels which cost 2,800 Turkish Liras (£775 or £1320). ‘We aim to better the daily comfort of the producer in the countryside, providing sustainability for sheepherding,’ Ser-Gün Chairman, Tamer Uğurluel, told Cihan news agency. Mr Uğurluel added that the project was the result of a 30-year-old collaboration between the local sheepherding association in the province and the government. The Turkish state covers half the cost for the solar panels using public funds used to support development in the countryside.

After all, reasons Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, 'your cell phone doesn’t just make phone calls, why should our benches just be seats?' According to a city press release, the benches will debut over the course of a week in locations that include Titus Sparrow Park in the South End, the Boston Common, and the Rose Kennedy Greenway. The benches are the second such smart seats in the city. A previous partnership between the MIT Media Lab, its spin-off firm Changing Environments and the city itself was a similar but smaller device called Seat-e. 'We’re delighted to continue the Greenway's partnership with New Urban Mechanics and the MIT Media Lab,' said Jesse Brackenbury, Executive Director of the Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy. 'The Soofa will allow visitors and their phones to enjoy the sun on the Greenway.' The forward-thinking benches feature two USB ports and a solar panel.

These residents, who previously would often wander aimlessly around the home, now have a comforting space to enjoy and relax in. The 1950s was a prosperous decade that marked the emergence of a distinct, post-war culture. This unique era featured an amalgamation of various architectural, artistic, and interior design elements that reflected the optimism and joy of the time. Decorating a room in the home in the typical style of the 1950s involves incorporating these elements to create a space that emanates warmth, comfort, and a sense of nostalgia. To achieve this 1950s-style room, we considered several essential aspects, such as color schemes, furniture, and accessories. One of the distinctive features of the 1950s was its lively color palette, which included pastels, bright colors, and contrasting hues; we made sure to incorporate these into furnishings, walls, and accent pieces. When it comes to furniture, the 1950s ushered in what is now referred to as mid-century modern design. Hallmarked by its clean lines, wooden frames, and tapered legs, mid-century modern furniture creates an atmosphere of simplicity and functionality without compromising on style. Our 1950s-themed room boasts such furniture pieces, and it includes plush chairs, a rounded coffee table, and a sleek sofa that are all reminiscent of that era. Lighting and accessories are equally important in replicating the typical 1950s style. We installed a Sputnik chandelier, an iconic lighting fixture of the time, which not only illuminates the room but serves as a striking focal point. Similarly, we adorned walls with framed vintage artwork, posters, and advertisements to enhance the room's nostalgic ambiance. By combining these elements, we created an authentic 1950s-style room that resonates with many residents, making them feel secure and comforted. It allows them to reminisce about their past, sparking vital conversations among themselves, staff, and visitors. This carefully structured environment positively impacts the residents' well-being, producing a sense of belonging and purpose for those who might otherwise aimlessly wander around the home. Consequently, this room has become a cherished space within the home, where residents can enjoy good company and an enriching glimpse into their past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who hires American private detective Alvin MacCarron to investigate Dickie's disappearance? Movie plot title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral.

Summarize this article: Establishing routines positively affects your child in a myriad of ways. Children like the familiarity and it builds trust and a feeling of safety. It also gives little ones the opportunity to learn to start processes on their own, which builds self-confidence and self-esteem while also reducing the time needed to put shoes on your one year old if you are ever in a hurry to get out the door. If you keep shoes near the door, for instance, your child will know that upon approaching the door it is time to sit on the steps (or floor) for “shoe time.” You can even explain why we need shoes as you put the shoes on you toddler. You can repeat a mantra, such as: first we put on the socks, then we put on the shoes, then we go play and have fun! Some children prefer to sit or stand while their shoes are put on while others prefer to be held. Depending on the preferences of your child, you should select a position that is both convenient for you and comfortable for your little one. If you prefer to hold your child, sit with your child facing away from you on your lap. Being so near the door may be too exciting for your toddler to sit still. If that is the case, try another neutral area that doesn’t contain their toys or other highly desired items that can cause angst. This can eliminate the headache of a toddler on the loose. The child is already strapped in. As a routine it also helps positively build your child’s emotional well-being while bringing you closer together. It can also be easier because your toddler will learn that to get out and having shoes on is a necessary first step.","completion":"Establishing routines benefits children in multiple ways, including building trust, promoting safety, and fostering self-confidence. Introducing a consistent \\"shoe time\\" near the door teaches the child the importance of wearing shoes and provides a chance for bonding.

His own prose style may have been spare and economical, but he was unable to part with the words, printed or written, of just about anyone else. According to his fourth wife, Mary, he was incapable of throwing away “anything but magazine wrappers and three-year old newspapers.” A trove of some 2,500 documents collected and preserved at Finca Vigía, Hemingway’s farm outside Havana, and now digitized and newly available at the Hemingway Collection in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum here, includes diaries, letters, lists, telegrams, insurance policies, bank statements, passports, tickets to bullfights and the Longchamp racecourse in Paris, a brochure from a swimming pool filter company, a page of his son Patrick’s homework and seemingly every Christmas card Hemingway ever received. “Was he a pack rat? Absolutely, absolutely,” Susan Wrynn, the curator of the Hemingway Collection, said last week. “We can only be grateful. But if you had to live with it, it would drive you crazy.” The digitized copies, which arrived last year, are the second big delivery of Hemingway material to the collection. An earlier batch in 2008 contained many more letters and some important manuscripts, including an alternate ending for “For Whom the Bell Tolls.” “There’s no real bombshell in the new material,” said Sandra Spanier, an English professor at Pennsylvania State University and the general editor of the Hemingway Letters Project. “The value is in the texture of dailiness, the way it rounds out our picture of Hemingway.” She added: “Hemingway didn’t know when he left Cuba that he was never coming back. His shoes are still there. It’s as if he just stepped out for a moment.” Hemingway lived at Finca Vigía, or Lookout Farm, from 1939 until 1960 — the longest he lived anywhere — and its 15 acres were probably the place where he felt most at home. He left in July 1960, traveled to Spain and then, in very poor health, returned to America. After a brief stay in New York, he moved to Ketchum, Idaho, where in July 1961, suffering from alcoholism, writer’s block and the aftereffects of two African plane crashes in 1954, he took his own life. After the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961, when relations between the United States and Cuba couldn’t have been worse, President John F. Kennedy quietly arranged for Mary Hemingway to travel to Havana and meet with Fidel Castro. The two struck a deal whereby Mrs. Hemingway was allowed to take papers and paintings out of the country and, in return, gave Finca Vigía and its remaining contents to the Cuban people. The Cuban government had little money for restoration, however, and for decades left the house more or less as it was, a tropical Miss Havisham’s, with a Glenn Miller record on the phonograph, the labels on the half-full Cinzano bottles fading in the sun, the roof leaking, the floors buckling. The remaining papers were moved to the basement, accompanied by a single overworked dehumidifier. This decline was arrested, starting in 2005, thanks largely to the efforts of the Finca Vigía Foundation, started by Jenny Phillips, the granddaughter of Maxwell Perkins, Hemingway’s longtime editor. The foundation also helped arrange for the scanning and preservation of the documents. The preservationists are all American-trained Cubans, and they have gone about their work with more zeal than discernment: The new material includes, for example, dozens of blank sheets of airmail stationery printed with the Hemingway address. Letters and telegrams are sometimes filed under the sender’s first name, sometimes the last, and apparently no effort has been made to single out important papers from lesser ones. In the middle of a folder mostly dedicated to Christmas cards is a 1952 letter from the critic Malcolm Cowley in which, flouting the usual conventions of reviewer confidentiality, he tells Hemingway that he has been asked by The Herald Tribune to write about “The Old Man and the Sea,” and leaves little doubt about what he is going to say: “ ‘The Old Man and the Sea’ is pretty marvelous — the old man is marvelous, the sea is, too, and so is the fish.” But the very randomness of this material — a telegram from Archibald MacLeish congratulating Hemingway on “For Whom the Bell Tolls” turns up with Mary Hemingway’s carefully typed hamburger recipes — turns out to be part of its appeal, its reminder that this is how lives are lived, haphazardly. That Hemingway loved being famous is amply demonstrated here by the scrapbook he kept of congratulatory telegrams he received in October 1954 after winning the Nobel Prize. From Ingrid Bergman: “THE SWEDES ARENT SO DUMB AFTER ALL.” From Toots Shor: “WE LIFTED A FEW TO YOU ALL DAY KEEP DRINKING.” The several Hemingway passports, besides providing a photographic timeline of him as his hair and mustache go white, attest to his restlessness and wanderlust. So does extensive correspondence with an automobile association about how to ship his Buick Roadmaster from Europe to Havana to the United States. There are logs he kept aboard the Pilar, his beloved fishing yacht, and a 1943 note from the American naval attaché in Cuba authorizing him to use some experimental radio apparatus, a reminder that during the war, when he wasn’t chasing after marlin and tarpon, Hemingway was supposed to be on the lookout for German subs. Some of the most interesting papers, however, belonged to Hemingway’s wife. There is extensive correspondence with Maison Glass, an exporter of luxury foods on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, from which she ordered things like fancy olives, turtle soup and French snails, and with the Conard-Pyle Company, a Pennsylvania nursery from which she ordered plants and got advice about how to grow roses in the Cuban climate. The impression you get is of someone extremely disciplined and well organized. It’s reinforced by a notebook, probably from before the war, when she was a Paris correspondent for The London Daily Express, listing page after page after page of French vocabulary and nuances of French expression. Apparently from the same period are a couple of mash notes. In one, addressed to “Hepsibah” or “Hepsey,” the writer has apparently been shopping and noticed a new display of sweaters: “And they are sumptuous, Hepsey. ... To remember your sweaters and how they suit you ... Your bosom under sweaters, blessed bosom, blessed haven.” Ms. Spanier believes that both messages were written not by Hemingway but by a newspaperman named Herb Clark, an old flame of Mary’s in the Paris days. According to Ms. Wrynn, Mrs. Hemingway, while packing up papers to take back to America, also burned many. Were these Paris notes ones she overlooked, or ones she couldn’t bear to part with? We’ll probably never know. We may also never know for sure the reason for some numbered notes Hemingway penciled to himself, probably in 1958. Ms. Spanier thinks they are arguments for why he should be allowed to rework some stories from the ‘30s that Esquire wanted to republish 25 years later in an anniversary anthology. They also read like all-purpose writing advice. “You can phrase things clearer and better,” one note says. The next: “You can remove words which are unnecessary and tighten up your prose.” Write a title for it.","completion":"Ernest Hemingway's Collection of Personal Documents and Letters Uncovered at JFK Presidential Library"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: The answer is:","completion":"Valley Glaciers, also known as Alpine Glaciers or Mountain Glaciers, form in high mountain regions and travel through valleys. Valley Glaciers primarily develop in areas where the accumulated snow continuously surpasses the rate of snowmelt, resulting in a steady buildup of snow, which is compressed into thick ice over time. As the mass of ice increases, it starts to move under the influence of gravity, gradually taking the form of a slow-moving river of ice. These glaciers occupy relatively steep mountain valleys and progress downhill, carving out deep U-shaped valleys while eroding the surrounding landscape. Mountain ranges with high precipitation rates or those located at high altitudes are particularly suitable for the formation of valley glaciers. The accumulation zone, which is typically the head or upper part of the valley, is where the ice first forms. This zone usually experiences more snowfall than snowmelt, contributing to the growth of the glacier. As the ice moves down the mountain, it scoops up various rocks and debris from the valley floor and walls, which further aids the process of erosion. Eventually, the ice reaches a region called the ablation zone, which is characterized by melting, evaporation, or sublimation. The boundary between the accumulation and ablation zones is called the equilibrium line, where ice accumulation equals ice lost due to melting or sublimation. Valley Glaciers can be present in various mountain ranges across the globe, including the Rocky Mountains in North America, the Andes in South America, the European Alps, the Himalayas in Asia, and the Southern Alps in New Zealand, among others. Depending on their specific location and climate, valley glaciers can exhibit a wide range of sizes and rates of movement. Smaller, less active glaciers might only move a few centimeters per day, while larger, more dynamic glaciers can travel several meters per day. Valley Glaciers play a significant role in landscape transformation and the hydrologic cycle, particularly in high-altitude regions. Glacial erosion contributes to the formation of various landforms, such as arêtes, cirques, and glacial troughs. Their movements also generate and transport sediment (glacial till) that eventually gets deposited in characteristic landforms such as moraines, drumlins, and glacial erratics. In addition, meltwater from valley glaciers serves as an essential water source for numerous rivers and streams throughout the world, feeding into lakes and, ultimately, the ocean. In conclusion, valley glaciers are a distinct type of glacier that form in high mountains and travel through valleys, slowly altering the landscape through erosion and deposition. They play a crucial role in shaping the Earth's topography and contribute significantly to the planet's water cycle. However, climate change is causing many of these glaciers to rapidly retreat, resulting in adverse effects on ecosystems and water resources in their surrounding areas."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Abraham Lincoln himself comes to New Mexico to discuss living together in peace with Acoma, a feared and respective Indian chief. He presents the chief with a cane as a gift and symbol of their friendship. Lt. Hunt is promoted due to his personal assistance to Lincoln in arranging the truce. Unhappily, a bigoted superior officer, Col. McComb, and the dastardly Judge Wilcox are opposed to any such treaty, and when Hunt states his objection, McComb has him placed under arrest alongside Acoma and a number of Indian braves, also breaking the cane.

Summarize this article: Republican insiders tell National Review Online that Representative Justin Amash of Michigan is privately considering a Senate bid, should incumbent Democrat Carl Levin retire. “People are asking him to look at it, and he hasn’t closed the door,” says a Republican operative familiar with Michigan politics. “If Levin steps down, I think he’s going to run.” Several libertarian activists say the 32-year-old congressman is intrigued by the idea. He recently huddled with his friends and allies to express his interest. But no decision is imminent. Amash is waiting to see whether Levin, who has less than 250,000 in his campaign account, will formally announce his plans. Levin, the chairman of the Armed Services committee, was first elected in 1978. Amash, a vocal critic of Speaker John Boehner and a popular presence on Twitter, is known as the libertarian bad boy of the House GOP. He was famously kicked off of the budget committee last year for his quarrels with the leadership. Amash also voted against Boehner during the speaker election in January. Instead of backing the Ohio Republican, he cast his vote for Raul Labrador, an Idaho conservative and a fellow Republican sophomore. Amash’s consideration is alarming to Michigan Republicans, who are hoping to back a more established candidate, especially if Levin retires and the seat opens. Amash, as a youthful conservative with a national following, would be a force in a primary. Many Ron Paul supporters see him as a libertarian leader for a new generation. ||||| Obama praises Levin: 'No one has worked harder' to bring jobs Carl Levin, who rose from one of the most prominent families in Michigan to become one of the most respected members of the U.S. Senate, sent political shock waves through the state when he A link to this page will be included in your message. |||||","completion":"Wow, that sounds fancy!

Most students would learn more by creatively mastering a single major — and leaving themselves time to take classes in multiple other fields. “Double majoring,” as Jacqueline Sanchez, a Wellesley College student, wrote in a recent op-ed for her campus paper, “ultimately prevents students from exploring many different disciplines.” Unfortunately, double majoring is just one part of a credentials arms race among teenagers and college students. This arms race exacerbates inequality, because it can make upper-middle- class students seem more accomplished than working-class and poor students. And the arms race is also unpleasant and counterproductive for many of the well-off students. They’re loading up on extracurricular activities, Advanced Placement courses and college majors, rather than exploring, going deep into one or two areas and learning what they really enjoy. Yesterday afternoon in Dallas, David Coleman — the president of the College Board, which administers the SAT, A.P.’s and other tests — gave a speech in which he took on the credentials arms race. I want to turn the rest of today’s newsletter over to an excerpt fr om that speech: “We should also reframe extracurricular activities. Applications for college have as many as 10 spaces for students to fill out with activities outside of class. How about three? Let’s say to students: ‘Share 1 to 3 things you are devoted to outside your classwork. If you want to do more than three things outside of class, that’s great, but not to get into college.’ “The College Board needs to say a similar thing about taking A.P . courses. We have data that taking up to five A.P. courses over the course of high school helps students complete college on time. But there is no evidence that excessively cramming your schedule with A.P. classes advances you. Let us say to students, ‘If you would like to take more than 5 A.P. courses because you love the class, do so, but not to get into college.’ ||||| The economy is changing at warp speed. Some of the jobs most in demand in 2010 did not even exist in 2004. What’s more, Americans switch jobs, on average, about every four years. Against this backdrop, colleges and universities are trying to figure out how best to prepare students for this evolving world. The trend since the 1960s had been toward occupational or vocational degrees, what some call practical degrees. The most popular undergraduate major today is business. But debates have erupted on many campuses between those who advocate for the content of a practical major and others who think that the skills of a liberal-arts major are the best insurance in a rapidly changing world. Meanwhile, students are hedging their bets: The number of double majors is on the rise, particularly at the most elite schools where supercharged students want to do it all and where the ranks of double majors have swelled to more than 30 to 40 percent of all graduates. Nearly four out of 10 students at Vanderbilt University have two majors. At the University of California at Davis, the number of double majors has risen 50 percent in five years. Double majors at MIT have jumped twofold since 1993. “Demand is up not because schools are encouraging it, but because students are demanding it,” says Richard Pitt. Pitt is a sociologist at Vanderbilt who, along with Steven J. Tepper, has looked at the rise of double majors on nine campuses as part of a research study that will be released next year. Among some of the findings of their study of 1,700 students across nine institutions: Economics is the most popular component of double majors for men; foreign languages are the most popular pairing for women. Foreign languages, in particular, benefit from double majors. Less than 2 percent of single majors pick a foreign language as their field of study, but more than 10 percent add it as a second major. Students who couple a science major with a nonscience major are more likely than others to say one is practical (and picked because of pressure from their parents) and the other is fun. The researchers paid particular attention to women majoring in STEM fields and found that they are more likely to enjoy that field of study if they have coupled it with a nonscience major. There is no single way to double major. About a quarter of students pick majors that complement each other and where the requirements overlap. Pitt maintains that two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market than two related majors. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he says. Students are aware of the status of different majors, and so those who double major typically identify themselves with what they consider the highest-status one first (such as science or economics). Black students and low-income students are least likely of all students on campus to have double majors. Pitt speculates that the reason is they don’t often arrive at college with Advanced Placement credits from high school. What surprised me about the research from Pitt and Tepper is how easy students found double majoring. For many of these students, Pitt told me, it didn’t require extra semesters of classes or impinge on their extracurricular activities. It used to be that it took a student four years to complete one major (and lots of students still have difficulty doing that), but here are students who are able to complete two majors in four years. “They have mastered the ability to juggle demands,” Pitt says. Not all college officials think this trend toward double majors is a good thing. Count Carl Moses, the provost at Susquehanna University, among them. He maintains that as college prices have increased, students feel compelled to get as much out of the experience as possible. They see the credential as the most valuable part of their undergraduate years, so why not get two? “They operate under the assumption employers are impressed by double majors,” he says. I wonder if the core curriculum and individual majors are demanding enough, considering that more students, especially at selective colleges, are able to take on second majors. Those who agree with the findings of Academically Adrift may see that lack of rigor as the reason so many students take on double majors. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"This article talks about how many college students are choosing to double major in different subjects. Some people think this is a good idea, but others think it takes away from the chance to explore different areas of study. The article also mentions that this trend might be part of a competition among students to have more impressive resumes for future employers. The idea of focusing on one major and learning about many other subjects, as well as limiting the number of extracurricular activities and Advanced Placement (AP) courses, is suggested to help students gain a deeper understanding of what they really enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Clinton made the comment, suggesting she will not be releasing any further medical information this presidential campaign, in an interview Wednesday with Florida’s WFTS ABC Action News. “Some doctors have said, because of your age, as well as your opponent’s age, that you could be at higher risk for dementia or even Alzheimer’s and have suggested that you take some neurocognitive test,” ABC affiliate reporter Sarina Fazina said to Clinton. “Would you be willing to do that?” “I’m very sorry I got pneumonia,” Clinton replied, letting out a hearty laugh. “I’m very glad that antibiotics took care of it.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The iPhone, the iPad, each of Apple's products sounds cool and has become a fashion. Apple has cleverly taken advantage of the power of the letter \\"i\\" -- and many other brands are following suit. The BBC's iPlayer -- which allows Web users to watch TV programs on the Internet -- adopted the title in 2008. A lovely bear -- popular in the US and UK -- that plays music and video is called \\"iTeddy\\". A slimmed-down version of London's Independent newspaper was launched last week under the name \\"i\\". In general, single-letter prefixes have been popular since the 1990s, when terms such as e-mail and e-commerce first came into use. Most \\"i\\" products are targeted at young people and considering the major readers of Independent's \\"i\\", it's no surprise that they've selected this fashionable name. But it's hard to see what's so special about the letter \\"i\\". Why not use \\"a\\", \\"b\\", or \\"c\\" instead? According to Tony Thorne, head of the Language Center at King's College, London, \\"i\\" works because its meaning has become ambiguous. When Apple uses \\"i\\", no one knows whether it means Internet, information, individual or interactive, Thorne told BBC Magazines. \\"Even when Apple created the iPod, it seems it didn't have one clear definition,\\" he says. \\"However, thanks to Apple, the term is now associated with portability .\\"adds Thorne. Clearly the letter \\"i\\" also agrees with the idea that the Western World is centered on the individual. Each person believes they have their own needs, and we love personalized products for this reason. Along with \\"Google\\" and \\"blog\\", readers of BBC Magazines voted \\"i\\" as one of the top 20 words that have come to define the last decade. But as history shows, people grow tired of fads . From the 1900s to 1990s, products with \\"2000\\" in their names became fashionable as the year was associated with all things advanced and modern. However, as we entered the new century, the trend eventually disappeared. Question: The writer suggests that _ . Options: A: the popularity of \\"i\\" products may not last long B: \\"i\\" products are often of high quality C: iTeddy is a live bear popular in the US and UK D: the letter \\"b\\" replaces letter \\"i\\" to name the products The answer is:","completion":"A: the popularity of \\"i\\" products may not last long"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor. He wrote on my end of semester assessment “Respectfully, Not Your Mom.” I still keep that assessment to remind me to wear life like a loose garment.

Question 2: How come I don't see repeated questions and answers on Quora? Why don't I see the same question with the same answer again? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"No, the answers to these two questions would not be the same as they address different aspects of the Quora platform. For clarity, I have provided detailed and respective answers for each question: Question 1: Do Quora review disturbing images in answers? How do I avoid seeing them again? Answer: Quora takes the quality of its content very seriously, and that includes reviewing and moderating images that appear in both questions and answers. Quora's moderation policies explicitly prohibit content that is excessively violent, gory, or includes disturbing imagery. Users are encouraged to report any content they consider inappropriate or disturbing, like graphic images, harassment, and spam. Once a report is received, Quora's moderation team will carefully review the content and take necessary actions, such as removing the content or suspending user accounts. To avoid seeing disturbing images again, you can take the following steps: 1. Report the content: Click on the three-dot menu (…) next to the answer with the disturbing image and select \\"Report.\\" Select the appropriate reason and submit the report. This helps alert the Quora team to review the content and remove it if deemed necessary. 2. Mute the user: If you don't want to see content from a specific user, you can mute them. Click on the user's profile and select \\"Mute.\\" This will prevent their content from appearing in your feed. 3. Personalize your feed: Quora generates personalized content based on your interests, topic choices, and users you follow. By adjusting these preferences, you can tailor your feed to show content more relevant to you. 4. Block explicit content: Quora offers an optional Safe Mode that filters out explicit content. You can enable it in your account settings by selecting \\"Safe Mode.\\" By taking these actions, you can minimize your exposure to disturbing images in the future. Question 2: How come I don't see repeated questions and answers on Quora? Why don't I see the same question with the same answer again? Answer: Quora employs algorithms and user-based actions to address the issue of repeated questions and similar content. Here's an overview of the reasons you may not see repeated questions and answers: 1. Algorithms: Quora's algorithms work to identify and merge similar questions because the platform aims to have a single question where users can post their best answers. When two questions are merged, all answers are assimilated under the final, merged question, thereby reducing redundancy. 2. User collaboration: Users on Quora can actively contribute to identifying similar content. Users can suggest an edit to a question, merge duplicate questions, or flag questions that appear to be duplicates. By involving users, Quora significantly reduces repetitive content on the platform. 3. Moderation: Quora's moderation team routinely reviews content and takes necessary actions to maintain high-quality content on the platform. They can merge or eliminate duplicate questions to minimize redundancy. 4. Personalized content: When you use Quora, the content displayed in your feed is tailored to your preferences, based on your interests, topics, and followed users. This customized approach reduces your likelihood of encountering the same question with the same answer multiple times. While Quora's efforts cannot entirely prevent every duplicate question or answer from ever appearing, the combination of algorithms, user action, and moderation works to significantly reduce repetitive content. This effort ensures an improved, informative, and enjoyable browsing experience for all users."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The youngest of three children, Toussaint was born in 1938 in New Orleans and grew up in a shotgun house in the Gert Town neighborhood, where his mother, Naomi Neville (whose name he later adopted pseudonymously for some of his works), welcomed and fed all manner of musicians as they practiced and recorded with her son. His father, Clarence, worked on the railway and played trumpet. Allen Toussaint learned piano as a child and took informal music lessons from an elderly neighbor, Ernest Pinn. In his teens he played in a band, the Flamingos, with the guitarist Snooks Eaglin, before dropping out of school. A significant early influence on Toussaint was the syncopated \\"second-line\\" piano style of Professor Longhair. After a lucky break at age 17, in which he stood in for Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith at a performance with Earl King's band in Prichard, Alabama, Toussaint was introduced to a group of local musicians led by Dave Bartholomew, who performed regularly at the Dew Drop Inn, a nightclub on Lasalle Street in Uptown New Orleans. His first recording was in 1957 as a stand-in for Fats Domino on Domino's record \\"I Want You to Know\\", on which Toussaint played piano and Domino overdubbed his vocals. His first success as a producer also came in 1957 with Lee Allen's \\"Walking with Mr. Lee\\". He began performing regularly in Bartholomew's band, and he recorded with Fats Domino, Smiley Lewis, Lee Allen and other leading New Orleans performers. After being spotted as a sideman by the A&R man Danny Kessler, he initially recorded for RCA Records as Al Tousan. In early 1958 he recorded an album of instrumentals, The Wild Sound of New Orleans, with a band including Alvin \\"Red\\" Tyler (baritone sax), either Nat Perrilliat or Lee Allen (tenor sax), either Justin Adams or Roy Montrell (guitar), Frank Fields (bass), and Charles \\"Hungry\\" Williams (drums). The recordings included Toussaint and Tyler's composition \\"Java\\", which first charted for Floyd Cramer in 1962 and became a number 4 pop hit for Al Hirt (also on RCA) in 1964. Toussaint also recorded and co-wrote songs with Allen Orange in the early 1960s.

The user appears to have mixed feelings about the story mentioned in their tweet. Let's break it down into components to provide a much more detailed analysis: 1. \\"It's a fun story\\": This phrase establishes a positive sentiment, as the user appreciates the story and finds it enjoyable or entertaining. 2. \\"despite the creepiness\\": The use of \\"despite\\" indicates that there is a contrasting element present in the user's experience of the story, and the word \\"creepiness\\" implies a negative sentiment, possibly discomfort, fear or uneasiness due to the story's creepy aspects. 3. \\"#hhrs\\": This hashtag adds to the context, as it's a tag often used for the \\"Hugh Hewitt Radio Show.\\" Since the hashtag is used in conjunction with this tweet, it can be inferred that the user is discussing a story they heard on this radio show. However, it doesn't directly contribute to the sentiment of the tweet. To summarize, the sentiment of the tweet is a combination of positive and negative feelings. The user acknowledges the unsettling aspects of the story but ultimately still finds it enjoyable and engaging.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a title for this article: With the arrival of Jon Huntsman, father of seven, into the Republican presidential primary race, the field is beginning to resemble a Holiday Inn on Kids-Stay-Free Weekend. There are big families all over the joint. And it's not just that many of the candidates have brought so many humans into the world. It's that they want to talk about it. At the recent Republican debates, candidates were practically one-upping each other with their fecundity. Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum sort of started it by wrapping up his opening statement this way: \\"Karen and I are the parents of seven children,\\" he said of his wife. Up next, Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann, who noted she and her spouse had five children and \\"were the proud foster parents of 23 great children.\\" Not to be outdone, in his introductory spiel former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney referred to his five sons, five daughters-in-law and 16 grandkids. Clearly, he's responsible for delivering a lot of new voters. But not as many as Texas Representative and former obstetrician Ron Paul. \\"I delivered babies for a living,\\" he said, \\"and delivered 4,000 babies.\\" PHOTOS: Presidents and Their Children The other candidates — Tim Pawlenty, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich — have two kids apiece, and everyone but Gingrich mentioned them, but it was the really big families that got everybody's attention. Is fertility becoming a presidential quality? Why were big families touted so enthusiastically at the debates? In the era of reliable birth control and working, time-strapped women, big families are an eye-catcher. They hold enough fascination for the general public that they have been the anchor of at least least two reality shows (TLC's Jon & Kate Plus 8 and 19 Kids and Counting). They're a staple of the tabloids, which offer a steady of diet of photos of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's large brood and snippets of news from the Octomom. While those associations are not always positive, a big family does make a candidate look very grounded. \\"A real piece of this is that they're trying to quickly introduce themselves to the voters,\\" says Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics. \\"It's a shorthand way of saying 'I'm authentic and real.' A big family demonstrates that they understand what voters experience, because they experience it too.\\" Large families can also telegraph, without actually saying anything, where a candidate stands on reproductive rights. Several of the candidates are part of religious groups (Mormonism and Catholicism) where bearing large numbers of children is encouraged. Their fruitfulness is a way of communicating that they're committed to their beliefs. PHOTOS: Inside a Mormon Ward \\"It would not surprise me if a decision has been made across the Republican consultants to espouse this image,\\" says Siobhan \\"Sam\\" Bennett, president of the Womens Campaign Forum and former Democratic congressional candidate. Large families are a sign of a preoccupation with home and hearth, rather than with a high-powered Washington career. \\"Given the mood of the electorate, to be inside the Beltway is dangerous.\\" Of course, the nature of a debate is to outshine your competitor, which led to the apparent litter-size one-upmanship among the Republican candidates. Some people dismiss it as a non-event. \\"I think voters by and large are concerned with the state of the economy and creating jobs as opposed to the size of a candidate's family,\\" says Danny Diaz, a former Republican National Party spokesman. \\"And this comes from a father of four.\\" Other campaign experts note though, that having a big family can show that a candidate has a sense of duty, is a multifaceted person, can manage a hectic life and — key to this election — probably knows how to stretch a dollar. Some point to Sarah Palin, whose children were front and center in her campaign for vice president in 2009, as a watershed candidate for large families. \\"A big part of the bump she got after the convention was from that image of her on stage with her five children,\\" says Walsh. After the convention, when she began to draw criticism for running when she had young kids, conservative voters came to her defense, which was also an unfamiliar sight. But despite those inroads — and those made by Nancy Pelosi when she gathered dozens of lawmakers' children and grandchildren to the podium after her swearing-in ceremony in 2009 — children are still something of a double edged sword for women running for office. Michele Bachmann (five kids, 23 foster kids), was either smart or lucky enough to have her children while she was young, so that they're all pretty independent by now. (Her oldest is 28.) It's unclear whether she will face the same scrutiny that Palin did as the campaign heats up. LIST: The 25 Most Powerful Women of the Past Century Female candidates with younger children are often encouraged to downplay their role as mothers, and not put a lot of family pictures on their campaign material. \\"If they have young kids, people ask, 'Who's going to raise those kids?'\\" says Walsh. For men, on the other hand, highlighting the kids is nearly always a net positive, because voters assume his wife will raise them. \\"There he is with the family and the golden retriever. It's a great image.\\" Sometimes, especially if they have younger children, women in public office pull the brakes on themselves, in the manner of Lisa Madigan, Illinois' Democrat attorney general. Since Illinois is the home state of the current President — and recently found itself down a Governor (after it divested itself of Rod Blagojevich) — you'd think she'd be well-placed for higher political office. But she didn't run, saying her current job, plus her two young kids, keep her busy enough. But with a total of 30 kids (not including foster children or grandchildren) on the GOP Presidential trail, it's possible that campaign staff may soon have a new refrain: We're going to need a bigger bus.","completion":"Fertility and Family Size: The Unexpected Emphasis in the Republican Presidential Debates"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You should write a yes-no question about the given term such that the answer is the one provided to you (i.e., If the answer is \\"No\\", you should ask a question that its answer would be \\"No\\", and if the answer is \\"Yes\\", you should ask a question that its answer is \\"Yes\\". ). The question should have a definitive answer (as opposed to ambiguous or subjective questions, e.g., Is Batman a good movie?). Create a question such that its answer can not be found easily on a single web page (e.g., mentioned in a Wikipedia page). This can be accomplished if answering the question requires more than one fact (facts = statements that can be found on a Wikipedia page or Google). For example, answering the question 'did Aristotle use a laptop?', one needs the know about the invention of the laptop and the death of Aristotle. Avoid questions should not just compare the properties of objects (e.g., Is a door bigger than an elephant?) or those that refer to details in the given description.

The proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments aims to revise and update the existing Directive 2004/39/EC. This new directive seeks to improve the efficiency and transparency of financial markets, strengthen investor protection, and address developments in financial market structures and technology. It includes measures to enhance market integrity, tackle market abuse, and promote the use of organized trading venues over less transparent OTC markets. The Directive will apply to a broad range of financial instruments, including shares, bonds, derivatives, and structured products. The proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (European Market Infrastructure Regulation) focuses on regulating over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, central counterparties (CCPs), and trade repositories. OTC derivatives are contracts that are traded and privately negotiated directly between two parties, without going through an exchange or other intermediary. Central counterparties act as intermediaries in financial transactions, reducing the risk involved for all parties. Trade repositories are entities that maintain a centralized electronic record of all transactions involving financial instruments. The main objectives of the proposed regulation are to increase transparency, reduce systemic risks, and promote financial stability in the European Union. It seeks to achieve this by requiring the mandatory reporting of OTC derivative contracts to trade repositories, imposing risk mitigation requirements on non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts, and subjecting CCPs to stringent organizational, conduct, and prudential requirements. In summary, these two proposals aim to strengthen the regulation and oversight of financial markets in the European Union by addressing key issues such as transparency, investor protection, and financial stability. The purpose is to promote a more resilient and transparent financial system, which is essential for the sustainable growth of the European economy and the well-being of its citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which language is this?","completion":"The language in the given phrase, \\"Počkej tu, hned jsem zpátky,\\" is Czech. The Czech language belongs to the West Slavic group of languages, which is a part of the larger Slavic language family. It is closely related to other West Slavic languages, such as Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian. The Czech language is spoken by approximately 10 million people, primarily in the Czech Republic but also by Czech-speaking communities and individuals worldwide. The phrase \\"Počkej tu, hned jsem zpátky\\" translates to \\"Wait here, I'll be right back\\" in English. Here's a breakdown of each word: 1. Počkej (Wait): This is the imperative form of the verb \\"čekat,\\" meaning \\"to wait.\\" In this case, it is used in a command, instructing someone to wait. 2. tu (here): This is an adverb indicating a specific location, in this case referring to the place where the speaker is currently. 3. hned (right): This adverb emphasizes the immediacy of the action, indicating that it will happen very soon. 4. jsem (I am): This is the first person singular form of the verb \\"být,\\" which means \\"to be.\\" In this sentence, it is used together with the following word \\"zpátky\\" to indicate that the speaker will be coming back. 5. zpátky (back): This adverb is derived from the word \\"zpět,\\" which means \\"back\\" or \\"in return.\\" In this context, it is used to communicate the speaker's intention of returning in a short time. In summary, the Czech phrase \\"Počkej tu, hned jsem zpátky\\" translates to \\"Wait here, I'll be right back\\" in English, indicating the speaker's intention to return shortly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The woman is cracking eggs into a bowl. There are some clear similarities between these two sentences. In both, a female subject is performing an action that involves cracking eggs. Additionally, the presence of eggs in both sentences indicates that the two sentences share a similar context, in this case, the preparation of food. However, there are also noticeable differences between the sentences. For instance, the first sentence features the word \\"lady,\\" while the second sentence uses the word \\"woman.\\" While these terms both refer to an adult female individual, they nevertheless bring different connotations. Generally, \\"lady\\" implies a more polite and formal term, while \\"woman\\" can be seen as more neutral. Additionally, the first sentence specifies that there were \\"two raw eggs,\\" while the second sentence merely mentions \\"eggs\\" without specifying a quantity or their state (although it can be inferred that the eggs are raw if the woman is cracking them). Another significant difference between the sentences is the tense in which they are written. The original sentence uses the simple past tense, indicating that the action has already occurred (\\"cracked\\"). Meanwhile, the second sentence employs the present progressive tense, which suggests that the action is currently ongoing (\\"is cracking\\"). Lastly, the second sentence explicitly mentions the presence of a bowl, while the first sentence does not. Taking these similarities and differences into account, I would rate the level of similarity between these two sentences as a 3 on a scale from 0 to 5.

A Court’s All-Hands Approach Aids Girls Most at Risk SAN LEANDRO, Calif. — Toni J., an effervescent 16-year-old who talks on speed-dial, lives with 11 family members in West Oakland, on a street buffeted by gang activity and poverty. Her mother died of an overdose, her father in a revenge shooting. In ninth grade, she was raped while on probation for shoplifting. At odds with the law from a young age, Toni has appeared in court 38 times. But things are suddenly starting to change thanks to an unusual collaboration between the judicial and social service systems. Toni is now doing well at school and even mentoring other at-risk girls. “You’re stepping up to the plate,” Judge Rhonda Burgess said to Toni from the bench before recommending that she be taken off probation. Like Toni, who was picked up along International Boulevard in Oakland, a major West Coast hub for sex trafficking, the vast majority of teenage girls who appear before Judge Burgess in the Alameda County Girls Court, a special tribunal for girls, have been recruited as child prostitutes or, like Toni, been considered at risk for involvement. (All those mentioned in this article are minors.) Jim Wilson/The New York Times Girls Court brings an all-hands-on-deck approach to the lives of vulnerable girls, linking them to social service agencies, providing informal Saturday sessions on everything from body image to legal jargon, and offering a team of adults in whom they can develop trust. And while still in its early years, the system is showing promise. Founded two and a half years ago and carved out of the existing juvenile court, the Girls Court is for young women considered most at risk, especially those forced into prostitution. It is part of a network of a half-dozen or so Girls Courts around the country, each with a different emphasis. The results have been encouraging: The court in Hawaii, a program where both parents and girls attend counseling for a year, has led to a marked decrease in detentions, according to a 2011 evaluation. The Orange County Girls court, which was started in 2009, intervenes in the lives of teenage girls in long-term foster care, with preliminary studies suggesting better grades and fewer placements. “It’s a unique alignment between adversaries,” Laurel Bellows, a Chicago lawyer and co-chairwoman of the American Bar Association’s anti-trafficking task force, said of the court’s collaborative approach. “These are not easy victims to deal with.” “It’s changed me,” Toni said of the court. “Without it, I probably would have been in jail, dead or somewhere getting beaten up by some dude.” In most states, including California, young prostitutes continue to be charged with crimes despite a growing consensus that minors who engage in sex for pay are victims of sex trafficking rather than criminals. Dr. Ellen Wright Clayton, a professor of pediatrics and law at Vanderbilt University, said the optimal strategies for helping these young people are still being developed, but that training judges, lawyers and others to identify them is a first step. “What is really needed is a collaborative approach that directs people to services rather than prosecution,” she said. “It’s an enormous problem we’re only beginning to get the scope of.” The Girls Court is part of a national movement to address the sex trafficking of minors domestically, many with a history of childhood abuse. Among the high-profile efforts are New York State’s new network of 11 statewide Human Trafficking Intervention Courts for those 16 years and up, and the passage of so-called Safe Harbor laws, in a small but growing number of states, that define sexually trafficked youth as victims rather than offenders. Oregon revised its child welfare practice so that a trafficked minor is considered a victim of abuse and the province of the child welfare system rather than the courts. Next year, sexually exploited minors in Minnesota will be referred to one of six regional case managers who will direct them to a network of emergency shelters. Here in Alameda County, which includes Oakland, a survey last year of 113 sexually exploited youths by WestCoast Children’s Clinic found that 75 percent of such youngsters here and in a neighboring county had experienced abuse and neglect. The lives that unfold in Courtroom 401 in the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center contain few glimmers of gladness. One girl, who was in detention in juvenile hall, entered the courtroom through a guarded, Brinks-like door. The police had found her passed out on an Oakland street, having injected drugs she could not identify. Another young woman, the daughter of a methamphetamine addict, was “sold” by her mother to an uncle in the Central Valley who sexually exploited her in exchange for drugs. One 17-year-old wore a fuzzy pink sweater in court, looking down at her feet. She has been sexually abused since childhood, one of her molesters an older brother. Last year, she fled a group home outside Los Angeles and became homeless, at one point sleeping in a park. In weighing such cases, Judge Burgess says she tries to understand the back story, the forces, often within their own families, that have made the young women feel diminished. Many girls come to court unaware that they are being exploited. “Once they begin to see it, they see their own power and have a chance at fashioning their own destiny,” Judge Burgess said. Jasmine grew up with a parade of men terrorizing her household. By age 7, she had watched her mother being savagely beaten by boyfriends in drunken rages. She spent years as a child prostitute and had numerous brushes with the law. “I was on the run from my mom,” she said. “I felt money was the only way.” Like many of the girls, Jasmine developed a tough-girl demeanor, capable of switching like quicksilver from ‘let’s talk’ charming to knife-edge anger. Judge Burgess directed her to an out-of-state program for exploited girls, where she spent nine months. Today, Jasmine has a job and is preparing to move into her own apartment. “I felt a lot of support from those ladies,” she said of the Girls Court team. “Even though we sometimes had problems with each other, I see why they did what they did.” The court provides adult guidance for girls who may never have had any. The female triumvirate — Judge Burgess; the assistant district attorney, Jennifer Madden; and Aundrea Brown, the public defender — offer appropriate behavior for the young women to emulate. Ms. Brown took one shopping after she showed up for court in her most alluring outfit. “I said, ‘Oh no, baby,’ ” Ms. Brown recalled. “ ‘That’s a cute cat suit, but this is not the place for it.’ ” The focused attention can give girls strength to confront long-buried emotional landmines. “Girls and women respond to consistency in relationships,” said Ms. Brown, who supervises the Alameda County Public Defender’s Juvenile Branch. Many flee their families to escape abuse, said Stephanie S. Covington, co-director of the Center for Gender and Justice in La Jolla. In adolescence, she said, “the risk for boys comes from people who dislike them: the police, their peers or a rival gang. In contrast, she said, “For girls, the violence in their lives comes from relationships — the person to whom she’s saying, ‘I love you.’ ” Many of the young women grew up in Oakland near their predators. “These kids are considered high-value property by high-risk criminals,” said Julie Posadas Guzman, the former director of girls’ services for the San Francisco Juvenile Probation Department. “A 12-year-old is way more valuable than a 40-year-old with a crack habit.” The county’s H.E.A.T. Watch unit, started by the district attorney in 2006, was set up to aggressively go after people who traffic in women: as of last year, 111 exploiters of children under 18 had been convicted. But being perceived as a snitch can be perilous. Erica W. was the kind of person to light up the room. She was still attending the Saturday program and preparing to testify against her pimp last year when her body was found dumped amid the eucalyptus trees along a highway in the Oakland hills. Efforts to come to grips with what many experts consider an epidemic vary widely across the country. New York State’s Safe Harbor law, the country’s first, classifies trafficked minors through age 17 as needing supervision rather than probation. In Los Angeles County, a special sex trafficking court diverts girls to a network of local foster care agencies and social service providers; meanwhile, the probation department now has a dedicated unit to “support young victims instead of locking them up when they run,” said Michelle Guymon, the department’s director. Nationally, safe housing for exploited youngsters remains “a systemic problem,” with trafficked girls often placed with foster parents who lack awareness of the issue, said Nola Brantley, who was trafficked herself and co-founded Missey, an Oakland-based nonprofit group that helps girls in crisis, provides mentoring and offers links to therapy and other services. For Judge Burgess and her colleagues, success is moment to moment. For every Toni, who writes poetry and loves math, there is a Pooh, who seems to be stable until she vanishes. Most of those involved in the Girls Court program here are sent to residential treatment programs out of state. Many are re-exploited within days of returning, sometimes “within hours of getting off the plane,” said Susan Drager, a program director of the WestCoast clinic. “It takes an adult woman an average of seven times to get out of a domestic violence relationship. How long will it take a child?” The ebb and flow of girls’ lives sometimes reveals itself in unexpected ways. At a Zumba class in juvenile hall, bottled up emotion accompanied a group of young women into the room; they had just been marched with their hands behind their backs down an anonymous corridor. But each girl’s own aggressive universe gradually gave way to something lighter. They were a sweaty band of cacophonous teenagers dancing with a stranger: joy.

Here is a news article: Explosions at three churches in northern Nigeria have killed at least seven people, prompting Christian youths to drag Muslims out of their cars and kill them in retaliation, officials and witnesses said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts on Sunday but the Islamist sect Boko Haram has often attacked church services in Nigeria. Two explosions within minutes of each other rocked churches in the town of Zaria, in Kaduna state. First, a suicide bomber drove a blue Honda Civic into a church, burning the front entrance and damaging the building, the church's pastor said. \\"Three people are confirmed killed. Others have been taken to hospital for treatment,\\" the Rev Nathan Waziri said. Militants threw bombs at another church, killing four children who were playing on the streets outside, said Deborah Osagie, who lives opposite the church. She said the militants were later caught by a mob and killed. A blast hit a third church in the state's main city of Kaduna, causing an unknown number of casualties, witnesses and the National Emergency Management Agency said. After the bombs, youths blocked the main road leading south out of Kaduna to the capital, Abuja, dragging Muslims out of their cars and killing them, witnesses said. \\"We had to return home when we saw them [the Christian youths] attacking. I saw many bodies on the ground but I don't know how many were dead or just injured,\\" said Rafael Gwaza, a Kaduna resident. Another witness, Haruna Isah, said up to 20 people may have been killed in reprisals at the roadblock. \\"There were bodies everywhere on the ground,\\" he said. Regular attacks on Sunday church services are usually claimed by Boko Haram, which says it is fighting to reinstate an Islamic caliphate that would adhere to strict sharia law. The group, which has become increasingly radicalised and meshed with other Islamist factions in the region, including al-Qaida's north African wing, is the main security threat to Nigeria. Islamist militants also attacked two churches in Nigeria last Sunday, spraying the congregation of one with bullets, killing at least one person, and blowing up a car in a suicide bombing at the other, wounding 41. The Islamists' leader, Abubakar Shekau, has justified attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigeria's volatile middle belt, where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet. Kaduna is close to the middle belt areas. ||||| Suspected Islamic militants bombed worshipers at three Christian churches on Sunday in northern Nigeria, killing some 23 people. Frustrated with the government's inability to stop a string of such attacks in recent months, some Christians responded today with reprisals, killing at least 7 more people. More than 150 people, mostly Christians, have been injured from today's violence. Police have not confirmed casualty figures, which are tallies from hospital officials. In 2012 alone, more than 10 Christian churches have been attacked in Nigeria. Boko Haram, a militant Islamic sect, has claimed responsibility for some of these attacks, including attacks on two churches last Sunday. Until today, Christians living in the predominately-Muslim north have mostly resisted being provoked to violence, responding instead with calls on the government to suppress Boko Haram and reestablish security. Today's retaliation from some Christians is raising concerns that a cycle of religious violence could start in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. \\"The reprisal attack is wrong because the solution to the country's insecurity is by ensuring dialogue with the sect members who are attacking the Christians and even Muslims,\\" says Ignatius Kasuwa, an analyst from Kaduna state, the scene of today's church attacks. Mr. Kasuwa also appealed to the government to immediately overcome the issue of insecurity in the country, stressing that \\"Muslims and Christians worship God but reprisal is against the teaching of the two religions.\\" Kaduna state lies on the dividing line between the country's Christian majority in the south and mostly-Muslim north. Police suspect the blasts at the three churches this morning were carried out by suicide bombers. One attack targeted the Evangelical Church of West Africa (ECWA) church in Wusasa, another at the Catholic cathedral of Christ the King in Zaria, and a third at Shalom Church in Trikania. Aminu Lawal, a police spokesman in Kaduna, confirmed the multiple blasts. \\"We all believed that it's suicide bombers, but for now I will not give the details because we are yet to compile.\\" An eyewitness at ECWA church said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber who forced his way into the church premises after being stopped by the security guards at the gate. The bomber however managed to detonate the bomb in front of the entrance. Dr. Taylor Adeyemi, a doctor at nearby St. Luke's hospital, confirmed that 40 victims, mostly children, were brought into the hospital following the blast at the ECWA church. Three victims were dead on arrival. The blast at the cathedral, meanwhile, left 10 dead and more than 50 injured, while the attack in Trikania involved multiple explosions. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks. But it mirrors the style of Boko Haram, whose terror campaign has killed more than 1,000 people in the past two years. The group, whose name means \\"Western Education is Sacrilege,\\" wants to establish a Muslim state and says it attacks Christians in revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigeria. Retaliatory attacks The explosions sparked violence in Kaduna as Christian youths retaliated, moving around with cutlasses and sticks among other weapons. The youths burned one mosque and broke into and vandalized another. About 35 victims of the reprisal attacks have been taken to St. Gerard's Hospital, according to the hospital's public relations officer. Seven of them were dead on arrival, burned by their presumed assailants. Malam Saidu Mujtaba, an eyewitness in Zaria, said he saw four bodies near the Goningora mosque; the account could not be independently verified. \\"It's high time for our people to revenge because most of the attack is purposely targeted on us, so I see no reason for us not to retaliate,\\" says Samuel Zakka, a Pentecostal Christian living in Zaria. Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Speaking by phone, Mr. Zakka said the Christian community had been very patient, \\"but retaliation is the only solution for now because the government fails to address the insurgency caused by the terrorists.\\" The Kaduna state government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew to bring the volatile situation under control. Security forces have mobilized in areas where Christian youths were beginning to get violent. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Explosions at three churches in northern Nigeria resulted in the death of at least seven people, leading to Christian youths retaliating by dragging Muslims out of their cars and killing them.

In some cases, this may not even mean your dog is receiving more meat. Ingredient lists on nutrition labels are ordered by the weight of each ingredient as it is added to the recipe. Once cooked, this weight can change, so these lists can be misleading. In order to select a pet food with the best quality, natural ingredient, you'll need to understand how to accurately read these ingredient lists. Check for the percentages of protein, fat, and other nutrients in addition to reading the ingredient list. Different foods may offer the same amounts of key nutrients, but they can vary dramatically in price. This is generally because the more affordable foods use lower quality protein sources. Purchase the best quality food you can afford. This can include salt, sugar, artificial colors, and added flavoring. These unnatural nutrient sources do not add to your dog’s nutrition in any way, but they are designed to make the food last longer without spoiling, look more appealing, or taste more like foods that your pet enjoys. While some dogs never show signs of digestive or other health concerns caused by consuming these unnatural food additives, others show significant negative response like decreased energy and elevated risk for diseases common among their breed. This is especially important as your dog ages or for younger dogs who are less active. Many prepackaged pet foods, even natural ones, include large amounts of sugar that make the food very high in calories without increasing nutritional value. In order to feed your pup the right number of calories, you’ll have to feed them a less than satisfying amount of food. Ideally, your dog’s food should be between 300 and 350 calories per cup, but most store bought pet foods are between 400 and 500 calories (or more) per cup. Count calories to make sure you’re not overfeeding. Most major, commercial pet foods, canned, dry, or refrigerated, are manufactured months before they reach the store. This means they’re high in preservatives that can decrease the nutritional value. However, many pet stores offer natural foods prepared in smaller batches or by local pet food manufacturers that have a much shorter shelf life because they use fewer preservatives. You can also purchase these more naturally derived foods from online directly from the manufacturer. Talk to your veterinarian or local pet store to get recommendations for natural, preservative free, and locally sourced dog foods. If you want to naturally boost the nutrition of any type of dog food, include some nutritional extras with every meal. Canned meats like chicken and salmon can dramatically improve your pup’s protein and vitamin intake when mixed with store bought food. Another great, low fat treat that packs a heavy vitamin punch is canned pumpkin. Add a few scoops to your dog’s meal once or twice a week to boost digestive function and deliver a number of necessary vitamins and minerals.","completion":"Choose natural pet foods with real ingredients and minimal preservatives, and carefully read ingredient lists and nutritional information to ensure optimal health for your dog, considering factors such as quality protein sources, calorie content, and possible additives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While at the mansion, he meets the General's spoiled and inquisitive daughter Charlotte (Sarah Miles) and wild younger daughter Camilla (Candy Clark). Marlowe's investigation of the homosexual pornographer Arthur Geiger (John Justin) leads him to Geiger's employee, Agnes Lozelle (Joan Collins), and to a man she has taken up with, Joe Brody (Edward Fox). He also discovers Camilla at the scene of Geiger's murder, where she has posed for nude photographs, and takes her home safely to a grateful Charlotte. Returning to the crime scene, Marlowe is interrupted by gambler Eddie Mars (Oliver Reed), who owns the house where Geiger's body was found. Mars's wife Mona hasn't been seen in a while and may have run off with Charlotte's missing husband, Rusty Regan (David Savile).

She had always been passionate about the ocean and its creatures, and never hesitated to incorporate her culture into her surfing. Yumi had heard about the stunning beaches and vibrant surf culture in Australia. Intrigued, she decided to embark on an adventurous road trip through eastern Australia, hoping to explore its beautiful landscapes and improve her surfing skills (Fact1). Upon arrival in Australia, Yumi decided to live in the famous Bondi Beach, renowned for its azure waves and golden sand. Bondi proved to be an ideal location for her to practice her craft and get inspired by the local surf culture. She quickly became a part of the tight-knit community and was often seen riding the waves with her creatively designed surfboard, adorned with a powerful shark illustration (Fact2). Yumi, with her bubbly personality and genuine interest in the local customs, easily made friends with her fellow surfers. Her unique style and appearance captured everyone's attention in Bondi. Yumi was the embodiment of Japanese \\"kawaii,\\" or cuteness, with her colorful clothing, adorable accessories, and infectious smile. Her fellow surfers were both fascinated and inspired by her exceptional fusion of kawaii aesthetics with the fierce vibes of a Shark surfer (Fact3). One day, while Yumi was chatting with her newfound friends at a local café, she came across a mysterious man named Gunja Man. He struck up a conversation with her about his upcoming journey to Nimbin - a small town known for its alternative lifestyle and counter-culture movement. Yumi, always eager to learn about different cultures and traditions, couldn't resist the idea of joining him on this curious expedition (Fact4). Together, Yumi and Gunja Man set off on a breathtaking journey across eastern Australia. Along the way, they visited numerous iconic landmarks and big tourist attractions. They marveled at the colossal Big Pineapple in Queensland, an ode to the region's thriving pineapple industry. Yumi couldn't help but feel a little nostalgic upon seeing this massive monument, reminding her of Japan's love for over-the-top attractions (Fact5). Next, they encountered the Big Merino, a colossal sculpture of a ram in Goulburn, paying homage to the region's thriving wool industry. Yumi was fascinated by this gigantic monument and the history behind it, eagerly snapping photos and sharing the experience on her social media, where her followers were thrilled to follow her adventures. Finally, they reached the renowned Big Banana in Coffs Harbour, one of Australia's most famous attractions. Yumi and Gunja Man explored the surrounding banana plantation and went on a thrilling toboggan ride together. Yumi marveled at the amazing experiences she had encountered during her journey, as she stood proudly beside the enormous fruit. Yumi's journey through Australia had not only expanded her knowledge of the nation's rich culture and diverse landscape but also allowed her to grow both as a person and as a Shark surfer. She had discovered a deep appreciation for the unique beauty and spirit of the Land Down Under. Upon returning to Bondi Beach, Yumi felt an even stronger connection to her adopted home, confident that her choice to set foot in this vast country had been a truly life-changing decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

NAGPUR - World champions Australia have marched boldly towards their first series win in India in 35 years after taking an imposing 415-run lead with seven wickets in hand in the third Test.","completion":"The context of the given information refers to a cricket match between Australia and India, which took place in Nagpur, India. Australia has taken a substantial lead of 415 runs in the Third Test match with three out of their ten wickets in hand, and hence, they are in a very dominating position in the game. If they go on to win the match, it would mark their first series win in India in 35 years, which is a significant landmark in the cricketing world. The Australian cricket team, also known as the Baggy Greens, boasts a proud history. They are known for their competitiveness and excellence on the field, having won multiple world championships, reflecting their status as a dominant force in the cricket world. The Indian cricket team, on the other hand, has been a strong contender and has been able to challenge top teams on their home soil. The Australian team, however, has found it difficult to secure series wins in India due to the challenging playing conditions, including spinning pitches. Nagpur, situated in the state of Maharashtra, is known for hosting cricket events at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium, where this particular test match would have taken place. Test cricket is the longest form of the sport and matches span over five days. The test match format consists of two teams, each having the opportunity to bat and bowl twice in the game – ideally, each side gets 90 overs a day to bat, amounting to 450 overs in total throughout the five days. The winner is decided based on both the aggregate runs scored and the wickets taken. In this specific match, Australia appears to be dominating after securing a substantial lead of 415 runs with seven wickets remaining in their second inning. The Australians are closing in on a historic series win in India – their first in 35 years – a period dating back to when Australian cricket legends such as Allan Border and Greg Chappell were part of the team. A series win in India would be a testament to the strength and resilience of the Australian cricket team, who would have overcome the difficult playing conditions, the passionate home crowd's support for the Indian team, and the challenging Indian spinners in their bid for victory. In conclusion, the information provided pertains to a cricket match between Australia and India occurring in Nagpur, India. Australia is edging towards a historic series win in India after 35 years due to their robust performance in the third Test match. If the Baggy Greens manage to maintain their commanding lead and eventually win, it will serve as a significant milestone in their cricketing history and mark a memorable occasion for cricket fans across the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What was a downside to the name Albert? Context: His birthday (14 December 1895) was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, Prince Albert, the Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been \\"rather distressed\\". Two days later, he wrote again: \\"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her\\". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \\"I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good\\". Consequently, he was baptised \\"Albert Frederick Arthur George\\" at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later.[a] As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth. Within the family, he was known informally as \\"Bertie\\".

Some great stretches to perform before you jump in the boxing ring are the standing toe-up Achilles stretch, assisted reverse chest stretch, and rotating stomach stretch. Always warm up your neck to prevent stiffness. This will help you move more quickly when you need to slip a punch. To warm up your neck, try loosening up your jaw and rolling your head around on your neck. Roll your head forward, then all the way around to the back in a half-circle. Then rotate it the other way. Do this for several minutes. Learning how you naturally react in boxing situations is a great way to avoid becoming predictable to your opponent. Avoid predictability while slipping a punch by learning some common moves: Throw a jab a little left of center to catch your opponent off-guard. Throw or feint one jab, then throw another quick one in the hopes that your opponent won't recover quickly enough. Often, having quick reflexes is not enough. During a fight, you can become punch drunk or tired and lose your faculties. Because of this, it’s helpful to study your opponent in the beginning of the fight and learn their tells. Watching your opponent can help you learn when they are going to throw a punch and what kind of punch it will be. Don't make too many assumptions about your opponent’s behavior. There is a chance that they are trying to get you into habits that will set you up for a knockout punch.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person creating a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula? ? After his tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures increased. ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show. His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year. On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \\"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\\" Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, which rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. The film was subsequently titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals. In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, \\"Big Pink\\". These songs, initially demos for other artists to record, provided hits for Julie Driscoll and the Brian Auger Trinity (\\"This Wheel's on Fire\\"), The Byrds (\\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\", \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\"), and Manfred Mann (\\"Mighty Quinn\\"). Columbia released selections in 1975 as The Basement Tapes.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Review: In Stephen King’s ‘End of Watch,’ a Murderer’s Victims Kill Themselves There is perfect symmetry to the way Stephen King aligns the opening of “End of Watch,” the smashing finale of his “Mr. Mercedes” trilogy, with that of its first installment. Mr. King isn’t flashy about it. Maybe he just can’t help writing like a stone-cold pro. The first book, “Mr. Mercedes,” began in 2009 with a rabid killer stealing the car of the title and plowing into a line of helpless people attending a job fair. The third book also starts on that day, but navigates its suspenseful way toward the present to a terrifyingly resonant end. When he staged his introductory attack, the self-proclaimed Mr. Mercedes was not satisfied with violence and notoriety alone. He went for the full trifecta and picked a cop to torment. He singled out the retired detective (or “Det.-Ret.”) Bill Hodges, an inveterate good guy, of course. And Hodges’s very first billet-doux from the killer — “they didn’t die but probably WISH they did! How about that, Detective Hodges?” — set forth everything on which the trilogy’s suspense would pivot, from the creep’s delight in maiming rather than killing to the seductive allure of driving others to suicide. The rules of engagement were set. “Finders Keepers,” the middle book, had a tangential plotline about a reclusive, Salinger-esque writer and the havoc wrought by a dangerously obsessed fan. But it was most memorable for the detective agency of the title, led by Hodges and featuring an indispensable young backup man, Jerome Robinson, and a quirky brainiac, Holly Gibney. Holly had trouble making eye contact, but she had quite a way with a sock full of ball bearings (“the Happy Slapper”), as she demonstrated at the end of that book. It was Holly who stepped in, when Hodges had a disabling health crisis, and put the monster Mr. Mercedes, also known as Brady Hartsfield, into an irreversible coma. A word about that coma for readers of “End of Watch”: Ha. Mr. King does a full-fledged version here of what he did fleetingly at the end of “Carrie”: He turns a quick shock into a major horror. There is a prelude set in 2009 on the day of Brady’s Mercedes attack, with two E.M.T.s hoping for a stop at McDonald’s. (One wants to order “one of those hash brown thingies that looked like a baked buffalo tongue.” Never let it be said that Mr. King lacks uncanny powers of description.) When they get the call to pick up a horrendously injured woman who will be one of the first murder victims in “End of Watch,” it’s goodbye buffalo tongue, hello nightmare. Why would this woman, who has lived, apparently contentedly, in a wheelchair for many years suddenly make a suicide pact with her mother and give up on life? One of Hodges’s favorite pastimes has become visiting Brady’s hospital room, where the immobilized, vegetative patient cannot react to the abuse Hodges heaps on him. Brady brings out his mean streak because the trio at Finders Keepers already know Brady to be “an architect of suicide” with a history of goading others into it. And he would be a person of interest in this case — but how can he be? Get serious. You’re reading Stephen King. Whenever the very weird can happen here, of course it does. An immobilized Brady becomes even more malevolent than the one who could drive cars and nearly (in “Finders Keepers”) blow up a stadium full of teenage fans of a boy band. Being immobilized just makes him that much more resourceful. He was always good with telepathy and computers and those skills get him up and running again, so to speak. But while Brady cooks up ways to threaten a certain horribly vulnerable part of the populace, Hodges deals with a very different kind of peril. It seems wrong to conflate elements of Mr. King’s real life with his fiction. But there are times when it’s hard not to, especially when he has spoken so frankly about his own ordeals. He has written repeatedly about characters who have struggled with addiction, just as he did, and whose sobriety is fundamental to who they are. Mr. King has also, after a road accident that nearly killed him, written about the frailty of the human body and the fear and suffering he endured. And when he writes here about pain, he does it with astounding honesty. Hodges begins this book as a guy who’s afraid to go to his doctor to find out why his abdomen hurts so much. He goes through most of the story with a bad diagnosis and a viscerally described, mounting agony that becomes one of the book’s biggest elements of suspense. The clock is ticking for him in a fight that Brady insisted on making personal, and Hodges desperately wants the strength to see it through. Because “End of Watch” is a breathless detective story, it’s built around a very specific mystery. (The title refers to Hodges; it’s a police term for finishing a shift.) How exactly is Brady operating from his hospital bed? And why do so many suicide victims own the same outdated computer game console, something like a dismal Game Boy, that contains one especially innocent-looking game involving colored fish? The thing looks harmless, and so does the cover of “End of Watch.” But when you realize what this otherwise handsome cover depicts, you may not want to look at it for long. A word about Mr. King’s staying power: This is his best book since the vastly ambitious “Under the Dome” (2009), and it’s part of a newly incisive, reality-based part of his career. At some point, the phantasmagorical became less central to him than the frightening prospects to be found in the real world. And he uses his ever-powerful intimacy with readers to convey the damage life can wreak. An author’s note at the end here gives the number of a real suicide hotline, and the novel is full of cautionary tales about vulnerable teenagers pushed past the brink. The book’s descriptions of the victims of Brady’s thrill-maiming also need no extra spookiness to hit home. Mr. King’s recent novels appeal to older readers more than his early ones did, but they’ve gotten tougher, not tamer. And even though a couple of this book’s principals wind up smiling by the time they get to the last page, you won’t be. That’s a promise.

If it’s possible to have a reasonable discussion with the person, ask them to stop. Have the conversation in person, not through email or text. Be clear and direct, and say something like, “I saw those things you said about me on Facebook. That’s inappropriate and it hurt my feelings; I’d like you to stop saying those things about me.” If you don’t know who the bully is, or if you’re being bullied by a group of people, attempting to talk it out probably won’t work. If talking it out won’t work, don’t directly respond to the text messages, instant messages, emails or other communications you may have received from the bully. Bullies want to elicit a reaction from their targets, so firing back a text will only make things worse. Your best course of action is simply to disengage. Also, don’t threaten the bully to get back at them. Sending a threatening message out of exasperation will only provoke the bully to keep up the bad behavior, and it may get you in trouble, too. Screenshot or save every email, text, instant message, social-media post, and any other evidence of cyberbullying that you come across. Record the time and date that each message was sent. If you can’t screenshot the offensive messages, you can copy/paste them and save the text on your hard drive.

Peter Loew is a driven literary agent and an example of the stereotypical narcissistic and greedy yuppie of the 1980s: he works all day and club hops at night, with little in his life but alcohol, one night stands and the pursuit of money and prestige. However, he is slowly going insane and sees a therapist frequently; it is during these sessions that his declining mental health becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants which eventually begin to scare even the psychiatrist. After he takes home a girl he met in a club named Jackie, a bat flies in through his window, scaring them both. At his next session he mentions to his therapist that the struggle with the bat aroused him, and after visiting an art museum with Jackie the next day, he ditches her, and she leaves an angry message on his phone. Loew meets Rachel at a night club, and takes her home. She pins him down, reveals vampire fangs and feeds on him. He soon begins to believe that he is changing into a vampire. He stares into a bathroom mirror and fails to see his reflection, he wears dark sunglasses during the day, and, when his \\"fangs\\" fail to develop, he purchases a pair of cheap plastic vampire teeth.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend, as \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" opens worldwide. The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get.\\" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps.

James Bond—Agent 007—pursues Ernst Stavro Blofeld, hunting down SPECTRE operatives across the world. He eventually finds him at a facility where Blofeld look-alikes are being created through plastic surgery. Bond kills a test subject, and later the \\"real\\" Blofeld, by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud. While assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd systematically kill several diamond smugglers, M suspects that South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping, and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Disguised as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to make it seem as though Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to Los Angeles, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse. At the airport Bond meets his CIA ally Felix Leiter, then travels to Las Vegas. At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the diamonds are passed on to another smuggler, Shady Tree. Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him into a coffin and send it to a cremation oven, but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks' body were fakes planted by Bond and the CIA. Bond tells Leiter to ship him the real diamonds. Bond then goes to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Bond watches Tree's act and afterwards goes to his dressing room, where he discovers that Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd, who did not know that the diamonds were fake. At the craps table Bond meets the opportunistic Plenty O'Toole; after gambling, he brings her to his room. Gang members ambush them, throwing O'Toole out of a window and into a pool. Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany Case, instructing her to retrieve the real diamonds at the Circus Circus casino.

No (b). Yes Answer:","completion":"(a). No. The Persian Wars took place between the Persian Empire (modern-day Iran) and several Greek city-states (such as Athens and Sparta) between 499 BCE and 479 BCE. The wars consisted of multiple events, with the most famous being the Battle of Marathon in 490 BCE and the Battles of Thermopylae, Salamis, and Plataea in 480-479 BCE. The main theater of conflict was in the Eastern Mediterranean, where the Persian Empire was attempting to expand its territories and exert control over the Greek city-states.

Her father, Karl Wilhelm Mutter, and her mother, Gerlinde, considered music lessons part of a good education. Thus, their son, Andreas, began practicing the violin at eight, and his younger brother, Christoph, had piano lessons. It came as no surprise when Anne-Sophie said she wanted a violin for her fifth birthday. Her parents thought she was too young for the violin, and persuaded her to start on the piano. But Anne-Sophie has always had a mind of her own. \\"I longed to play the violin,\\" she says. \\"It seemed to me a much more interesting instrument.\\" After six months, her parents gave in. The famous violin teacher Erna Honigberger, who lived nearby, became Anne-Sophie's tutor. After only nine months of lessons, she entered the six-year-old in a nationwide competition for young musicians. With Christoph accompanying her on the piano, Anne-Sophie won first prize. In 1974, Erna, Erna Honigberger died. Anne - Sophie's new teacher was Aida Stucki. She taught Anne-Sophie to develop her own ideas on how a piece should be played, not just to imitate others. This is one of the violinist's strongest most distinctive characteristics today. Though the Mutters were short of money at time, they limited their daughter's performances to one or two a year. \\"We are glad we went the family road,\\" says her father. \\"No outsider can ever have an effect on our daughter's career or push her into playing more concerts than she wants to.\\" Later she was allowed to give six to eight concerts a year and make some recordings.

Solve 0 = 2*t - 15 + 13 for t.","completion":"In order to solve the given equation 0 = 2*t - 15 + 13 for the variable t, we need to follow the steps below. Step 1: Simplify the equation. The given equation is: 0 = 2*t - 15 + 13 First, we can combine the constant terms (-15 and +13). Adding these, we get: -15 + 13 = -2 Now, we can rewrite the equation as: 0 = 2*t - 2 Step 2: Isolate the variable t. To find the value of t, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. In this case, we'll move the constant term (-2) to the other side of the equation by adding 2 to both sides. This gives us: 0 + 2 = 2*t Which simplifies to: 2 = 2*t Step 3: Solve for t. Now, to get the value of t, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2: 2 / 2 = (2*t) / 2 Which simplifies to: 1 = t Step 4: Check the solution. Finally, it's always a good idea to check our solution by substituting it back into the original equation and verifying that it makes the equation true. So, let's substitute t = 1 into the given equation: 0 = 2*t - 15 + 13 0 = 2*(1) - 15 + 13 Evaluating the equation, we get: 0 = 2 - 15 + 13 0 = -13 + 13 0 = 0 Since the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation are equal, our solution t = 1 is indeed correct.

This foreign houseplant can be enjoyed by anyone, not just brides. With a little proper attention and careful planning on location, this foreign houseplant, which is from Madagascar, can be brought into the home where it can become an interesting focus. Caring for the Hawaiian Wedding Plant is not much different from caring for any other houseplants that may already be in your home. The only difference between this type of houseplant and others is the amount of the basic requirements that this foreign houseplant needs to survive and perform beautifully. During the growing season, this plant requires its wet soil, but when winter rolls around, this plant needs its soil to be kept drier. Hawaiian Wedding Plants should also be potted in well-drained soil and placed in a location that receives full sun. That the soil must be kept wet does not mean that it should sit in water, so the soil must drain easily or this plant will not survive. Water the plant daily and feed this plant every two to three weeks with a little fertilizer for acid-loving plants. Prune in early spring, even as early as February.

The colorful Boris Berezovsky, who died in unexplained circumstances over the weekend at a country estate south of London, was one of the Russian oligarchs who made fortunes following the breakup of the former USSR. But by the time of his death the 67-year-old was reportedly in financial difficulties after he was ordered to pay a massive divorce settlement to his ex-wife as well as legal costs following the loss of a 6.5 billion lawsuit against fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich last year.

His death in 2013, under mysterious circumstances at a country estate south of London, fuelled further speculation. Berezovsky was 67 years old at the time. His journey began as a mathematics professor and systems analyst in Moscow; however, the allure of substantial financial gains led him to venture into the world of business in post-Soviet Russia. As reported by CNN's Jill Dougherty, who had interviewed him on multiple occasions, his decision to switch gears proved to be lucrative. Berezovsky's fortune grew dramatically during the chaotic privatization period of the 1990s, culminating in his status as an oligarch. However, his life took a drastic turn in the years leading up to his death. Berezovsky was ordered to pay a sizable divorce settlement to his ex-wife, further compounded by significant legal costs after losing a 6.5 billion lawsuit against another Russian oligarch, Roman Abramovich. These financial burdens were likely key contributing factors in his declining fortune and increasing despair. In his final moments, Berezovsky blamed Vladimir Putin for his death, an accusation the Kremlin vehemently denied. Tensions between Berezovsky and Putin, the Russian President, had been escalating over the years, with Berezovsky becoming an ardent critic of Putin's administration. Berezovsky's exile from Russia and subsequent residence in the UK only fueled the animosity between the two. Berezovsky's death, which remains shrouded in mystery, highlights the volatility and risk that many Russian oligarchs faced in post-Soviet Russia, where fortunes could be made and lost with remarkable swiftness. His life serves as a cautionary tale for those seeking power and wealth in rapidly changing political and economic landscapes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hypothesis: Girl of Asian origin holding a green sign to protest .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the premise provided, we can conclude that the hypothesis is likely accurate. The premise describes an Asian girl holding a green sign while protesting. The hypothesis simply restates this information in a slightly different format, as it refers to a \\"Girl of Asian origin holding a green sign to protest.\\" It is important to note that the hypothesis doesn't provide any additional information or implications beyond what was presented in the premise. The hypothesis stays focused on the core elements of the premise, namely the ethnicity of the girl (Asian origin), her action (holding a green sign), and the context (protesting). However, some factors could have been unclear or assumed from the premise, which might affect the accuracy of the hypothesis: 1. The cultural or ethnic origin of the girl: In the premise, \\"Asian girl\\" can denote the girl's racial or ethnic background without any further specifics. The term \\"Asian\\" covers a wide range of ethnicities and nationalities, which the hypothesis also reflects with \\"Girl of Asian origin.\\" 2. The green sign: Both the premise and the hypothesis mention a green sign, but we don't know the purpose or message the sign carries. A protest usually involves a specific cause or issue being addressed, and the color of the sign could have symbolism or be connected to the cause. However, this information isn't provided in either the premise or the hypothesis. 3. The nature of the protest: Similarly, the type of protest and its cause are not explicitly stated in the premise or hypothesis. Protests can be peaceful or confrontational, planned or spontaneous, and focus on a wide range of issues, from social and political to environmental concerns. While the hypothesis captures the fact that a protest is taking place, which aligns with the information from the premise, it doesn't provide any insights into the nature of the protest or its causes. Based on this evaluation, it is safe to say that the hypothesis aligns with the premise and does not deviate from the information presented. The hypothesis is thus likely an accurate representation of the given premise.

Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media. - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - Catwoman (Selina Kyle) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. The character was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, and she made her debut in \\"Batman\\" #1 (Spring 1940), in which she is known as \\"the Cat\\". Catwoman has traditionally been portrayed as a supervillain and adversary of Batman, but since the 1990s, she has been featured in an eponymous series that depicts her as an antiheroine rather than a traditional villain. Catwoman is known for having a complex love-hate relationship with Batman and has been Batman's most enduring love interest. - Aquaman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in \\"More Fun Comics\\" #73 (November 1941). Initially a backup feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo title. During the late 1950s and 1960s superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding member of the Justice League of America. In the 1990s Modern Age, Aquaman's character became more serious than in most previous interpretations, with storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis. - Green Arrow is a fictional superhero who appears in comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Mortimer Weisinger and designed by George Papp, he first appeared in \\"More Fun Comics\\" #73 in November 1941. His real name is Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Queen, a billionaire businessman and owner of Queen Industries, also a well-known celebrity in his locale of Star City. Sometimes shown dressed like Robin Hood, Green Arrow is an archer who uses his skills to fight crime in his home cities of Star City and Seattle, as well as alongside his fellow superheroes as a member of the Justice League. Though much less frequently used in modern stories, he also deploys a range of trick arrows with various special functions, such as glue, explosive-tipped, grappling hook, flash grenade, tear gas and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations. At the time of his debut, Green Arrow functioned in many ways as an archery-themed analogue of the very popular Batman character, but writers at DC subsequently developed him into a voice of progressivism very much distinct in character from Batman. - DC Comics, Inc. is an American comic book publisher. It is the publishing unit of DC Entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. , a division of Time Warner. DC Comics is one of the largest, oldest, and most successful companies operating in American comic books, and produces material featuring numerous well-known heroic characters, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Supergirl, The Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg, Shazam, Martian Manhunter, Zatanna, Static Shock, Hawkman, Hawkgirl and Green Arrow. The fictional DC universe also features teams such as the Justice League, the Justice Society of America, the Suicide Squad, and the Teen Titans, and well-known villains such as Joker, Lex Luthor, Darkseid, Catwoman, Ra's al Ghul, Deathstroke, Professor Zoom, Sinestro, Black Adam and Brainiac.

Created by editor Julius Schwartz, writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams, the character first appeared in \\"Batman\\" #232's \\"Daughter of the Demon\\" (June 1971). The character is one of Batman's most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's rogues gallery. Given Ra's al Ghul's high status as a supervillain, he also comes into conflict with other superheroes in the DC Universe. - Darkseid (pronounced \\"Darkside\\") is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer-artist Jack Kirby, the character made a cameo appearance in \\"Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen\\" #134 (December 1970) before making his full first appearance in \\"Forever People\\" #1 (February 1971). - The Justice Society of America (JSA) is a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) (Associated Press) WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Days after the United Nations voted to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, Donald Trump questioned its effectiveness Monday, saying it's just a club for people to \\"have a good time.\\" The president-elect wrote on Twitter that the U.N. has \\"such great potential,\\" but it has become \\"just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!\\" On Friday, Trump warned, \\"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,\\" referring to the day he takes office. The decision by the Obama administration to abstain from Friday's U.N. vote brushed aside Trump's demands that the U.S. exercise its veto and provided a climax to years of icy relations with Israel's leadership. Trump told The Associated Press last December that he wanted to be \\"very neutral\\" on Israel-Palestinian issues. But his tone became decidedly more pro-Israel as the presidential campaign progressed. He has spoken disparagingly of Palestinians, saying they have been \\"taken over\\" by or are condoning militant groups. Trump's tweet Monday about the U.N. ignores much of the work that goes on in the 193-member global organization. This year the U.N. Security Council has approved over 70 legally binding resolutions, including new sanctions on North Korea and measures tackling conflicts and authorizing the U.N.'s far-flung peacekeeping operations around the world. The General Assembly has also approved dozens of resolutions on issues, like the role of diamonds in fueling conflicts; condemned human rights abuses in Iran and North Korea; and authorized an investigation of alleged war crimes in Syria. Trump's criticism of the U.N. is by no means unique. While the organization does engage in large-scale humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts, its massive bureaucracy has long been a source of controversy. The organization has been accused by some Western governments of being inefficient and frivolous, while developing nations have said it is overly influenced by wealthier nations. Trump tweeted later Monday, \\"The world was gloomy before I won — there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10 percent and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!\\" Markets are up since Trump won the general election, although not quite by that much. The Standard & Poor's 500 is up about 6 percent since Election Day, while the Dow has risen more than 8 percent. As for holiday spending, auditing and accounting firm Deloitte projected in September that total 2016 holiday sales were expected to exceed 1 trillion, representing a 3.6 percent to 4.0 percent increase in holiday sales from November through January. Finally, Trump took to Twitter again late Monday to complain about media coverage of his charitable foundation. He wrote that of the \\"millions of dollars\\" he has contributed to or raised for the Donald J. Trump Foundation, all of it \\"is given to charity, and media won't report.\\" Trump said Saturday he will dissolve his charitable foundation before taking office to avoid conflicts of interest. The New York attorney general's office has been investigating the foundation following media reports that foundation spending went to benefit Trump's campaign. The president-elect is spending the holidays at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. He had no public schedule Monday. ___ Associated Press writer Edith Lederer in New York contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"President-elect Donald Trump has criticized the United Nations in a tweet, describing it as “just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time”.

The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Riki Michele (born Michele Bunch, currently Michele Palmer) is a female Christian alternative music artist.

A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre.

For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers.

Q:This is a correct answer to the following question about American middle class. Yes or no? Answer: While the concept is typically ambiguous in popular opinion and common language use, contemporary social scientists have put forward several, more or less congruent, theories on the American middle class. Question: what is middle class in the us A:","completion":"The middle class in the United States is a social and economic class comprised of individuals and households who fall between the working class and the upper class within the broader American social hierarchy. Defining the middle class is somewhat challenging, as opinions and concepts can be ambiguous in everyday language and popular opinion; however, contemporary social scientists have offered several congruent theories. In order to understand what constitutes the American middle class, it is essential to consider a range of factors including income, occupation, education, and social attributes. 1. Income: One of the most common ways of defining the middle class is through income levels. Many experts use household income as a key indicator: for instance, the Pew Research Center categorizes those with incomes between two-thirds and twice the national median income as \\"middle class.\\" According to this definition, a household earning around 40,000 to 120,000 (adjusted for-cost-of-living) would be considered middle class in the United States. 2. Occupation: Occupational status is another crucial factor in defining the middle class. Those who work in white-collar jobs, such as managerial, professional, and technical roles, are often considered part of the middle class. These jobs typically require a higher level of education and training, provide greater income stability, and offer opportunities for upward mobility as compared to the blue-collar jobs traditionally associated with the working class. 3. Education: Education plays a significant role in shaping the American middle class. Those with a college degree or higher level of education are more likely to belong to the middle class based on their increased access to higher-paying jobs and opportunities for career advancement. 4. Social attributes: Social attributes, such as the ability to maintain a specific standard of living, the level of economic security, and the level of engagement in cultural and community activities, also contribute to defining the middle class. The middle class often enjoys a relatively stable and comfortable lifestyle, with access to resources like health care, quality education, and housing. Moreover, members of the middle class may actively participate in their communities through civic organizations, education-related functions, or cultural events. 5. Wealth and assets: Finally, the accumulation of wealth and assets is an important aspect of middle-class status. In addition to income, factors such as homeownership, retirement savings, and other forms of investments can play a role in differentiating the middle class from other social classes. In conclusion, the middle class in the United States is a diverse and multifaceted social group shaped by various factors, such as income, occupation, education, social attributes, and accumulated wealth and assets.

Time A is set in the year one thousand when using fossil fuels was not very common. Time B is set in the year two thousand when fossil fuels are used in large quantities. In which time more carbon dioxide would be realeased into the atmosphere, time A or time B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Time B. To justify this answer, we must consider the use and combustion of fossil fuels, which is one of the main processes that release carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. In Time A, the year one thousand, fossil fuel usage was not very widespread. Most energy use during this period came from biofuels, such as wood, and any CO2 released into the atmosphere was part of a natural carbon cycle - carbon dioxide was emitted but was also absorbed by vegetation. On the other hand, Time B refers to the year two thousand, during which the use of fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and natural gas) was significantly higher due to industrialization and advancements in technology. The burning of these fuels releases large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere. This increase in CO2 emissions during the later period contributes to a higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is a major factor in global warming and climate change.

The Bengal breed’s most distinctive physical feature is their beautiful spotted coat, though sometimes their coats will be marbled. These cats have inherited these spots from their leopard ancestors. All Bengals will, without exception, have a spotted coat. Bengal cats usually have a shine or shimmer to their coat that is most visible in direct sunlight. Breeders often call this the “glitter” effect. All Bengals have spotted coats, but they can come in a variety of colors. The most common color pattern is a brown or golden background color. But these cats can also come in cinnamon-sorrel colors, gray-beige, charcoal, silver, or blue color patterns. Sometimes the spots link together to resemble more of a striped patterns, but these are still considered Bengal cats. This is often called a marbled pattern variation. Bengal cats also have a striped black-tipped tail. Bengal cats are usually quite large and lean.

Write a title for this article: Like a lot of Americans, Jenn Louis wasn’t raised on a noble diet of organic food. “I grew up in the ’70s,” said Ms. Louis, an acclaimed chef in Portland, Ore. “I ate everything that was served to me. We didn’t have organic anything. We had local dairy and that kind of stuff, but growing up in Southern California, I ate what we ate, and some of it was canned, some of it was frozen. And I’m pretty darn healthy.” So how does she regard the news about that somewhat perplexing study of organic food? You can probably guess which study we’re referring to. It’s the one where some scientists at Stanford University cast doubt on whether organic food is really any more “nutritious” than the nonorganic stuff we ingest. Maybe you think the results of the study are sort of missing the point. Personally, I tend to lean toward organic food (when I can afford it) not because of any perception of turbo-charged vitamin density, but because it makes me feel nice to think that I’m cutting down on my kids’ intake of, say, pesticides, antibiotics and weird hormones. But speaking with Ms. Louis led me to consider a different twist on “missing the point.” If it is indeed heightened nutrition (and flavor) that you’re after with the food you buy, she suggested, focusing on what is organic might not always be as effective as focusing on what is local and in season. “If you eat in season, it’s going to be healthier for you,” she said. “It’s going to be higher in nutrients. I don’t have a garden, but if I had a garden and I went out and picked some kale to have for dinner, every minute that it’s out of the ground, it’s losing nutrients. It’s losing flavor, because the sugars change. So when I’m trucking something up from Chile in the middle of winter, it’s not going to have the best flavor, nor will it be as nutritious.” Ms. Louis said that she and her team strive to serve things like locally sourced chicken and lamb and rabbit at her restaurants, Lincoln and Sunshine Tavern. If her ingredients happen to be organic, that’s lovely, but she doesn’t stridently insist on it. “Yes, organic is really important,” she said. “It’s really good for the soil, it’s really good for continuing generations of farming practice. If we could do it on a larger scale, that would be awesome.” But even some of the most careful and conscientious farmers don’t have the luxury of being impeccably, purely organic in every instance. “Some of my farmers, they’re like, ‘Our vegetables are organic, but our fruit trees are just too valuable,’” Ms. Louis explained. “It takes so long to grow them that they’re going to minimally spray their trees so that they’re healthy. Because if you lose that tree, you’re dust for another 10, 15 years.” In part, Ms. Louis stresses what’s local because, of course, she herself is a local entrepreneur. “I own small, mom-and-pop businesses,” she said. “I look at my bottom line every day, and I like to be supported. I would rather somebody support me than a big chain.” And what her business ultimately depends on is food that is full of flavor. “I don’t think it matters, flavor-wise, if it’s organic or nonorganic,” she said. She does notice a pronounced difference in flavor, though, when the food comes from not too far down the road when it’s ripe and ready for the table. Her perspective? If you’re off to the grocery store or the farmers’ market this weekend, first figure out what is in season, and then seek that out. “Tomatoes taste really good right now, and eggplant is really, really good right now — it has that sweetness it should have, it’s got a little bit of bitter, it’s got that really wonderful flavor,” she said. “If you eat tomatoes in December, they’re not going to be awesome.”","completion":"Title: \\"From Organic to Local: The Real Key to Nutrient-Rich and Flavorful Food\\" In this article, acclaimed Portland chef Jenn Louis shares her thoughts on the recent study conducted by Stanford University scientists that raised questions about the nutritional benefits of organic food compared to non-organic counterparts. Rather than focusing solely on whether food is organic or not, Louis emphasizes the importance of considering locally-sourced, in-season produce as a way to boost the nutritional content and flavor of the food we eat. The article delves into Louis' personal journey with food, discussing how she grew up on a typical diet of the 70s, which included canned and frozen items, yet maintains good health. While acknowledging the environmental benefits of organic farming practices, she also highlights the challenges faced by small-scale farmers trying to maintain organic operations and the importance of supporting local businesses. Louis stresses that eating in-season, locally-sourced food is key for both optimal taste and nutritional value. By focusing on what is fresh and available in the region, consumers can potentially achieve better health outcomes than by simply relying on organic labels. Additionally, she asserts that focusing on seasonal foods can also lead to a more enjoyable and flavorful dining experience. In conclusion, the article encourages readers to consider a shift in perspective when shopping for food, placing equal emphasis on local and in-season options rather than exclusively seeking out organic products. This approach is not only beneficial for personal health and taste preferences but also supports local farmers and businesses, creating a stronger and more sustainable food system."},{"prompt":"Question: When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state.

I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife.

U.S. Ups Ante for Spying on Firms WASHINGTON—The White House threatened China and other countries with trade and diplomatic action over corporate espionage as it cataloged more than a dozen cases of cyberattacks and commercial thefts at some of the U.S.'s biggest companies. The White House unveiled a new strategy to exert pressure on China and other countries that engage in corporate espionage against the U.S. Jared Favole reports on The News Hub. Photo: Getty Images. Top administration officials painted a pervasive portrait of the far-reaching costs of espionage—competitive disadvantages, job losses, product impacts—that American firms as well known as General Motors Co. and DuPont Co. have already had to confront. \\"There are only two categories of companies affected by trade-secret theft: those that know they've been compromised and those that don't know it yet,\\" Attorney General Eric Holder said at a White House conference Wednesday. \\"A hacker in China can acquire source code from a software company in Virginia without leaving his or her desk.\\" A number of corporations backed the push to intensify pressure on foreign governments to combat the theft of trade secrets. John Powell, general counsel of American Superconductor, alleged at the conference that his firm's intellectual property was stolen by its largest customer, a big China wind-turbine manufacturer, with the help of a former employee. \\"It's a real threat and it's a really costly threat,\\" he said. The new strategy is aimed at producing a change in Beijing, which has repeatedly denied it sponsors such incursions, including this week. Incidents linked to China in recent years include cyberinfiltrations of Google Inc., computer security firm RSA Security Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp., and Nortel Networks Corp. Attorney General Holder, center, and acting Commerce Secretary Rebecca Blank arrive for a White House conference on cybersecurity measures. The new push comes on the heels of fresh allegations of Chinese cyberspying, including at The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and other media outlets, and represents an effort by Washington to respond to growing complaints about theft of military and corporate secrets. The administration's strategy, outlined in a report at the conference, will bring together officials from across the government. New measures raise the prospect of stepped-up U.S. trade restrictions on products and services derived from stolen trade secrets and diplomatic pressure to reinforce the administration's commitment to curbing such thefts. The White House on Wednesday didn't specify actions it would take against China, but the strategy document is peppered with examples of Chinese theft of corporate secrets from top American firms, and officials said the administration has repeatedly raised the theft issue at senior levels of the Chinese government. \\"With respect to China, protection of intellectual property and trade secrets remains a serious and highly troubling issue,\\" said Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Robert Hormats, at the White House event, which marked the beginning of the new strategy. Of the 19 cases that had resulted in charges and convictions detailed in the strategy document, 16 involve theft aimed to benefit entities in China, such as stolen hybrid technology from GM and military secrets from defense contractor L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., among others. The Obama administration is casting trade-secret theft as a major threat to both economic and national security. \\"The theft of trade secrets impacts national security, undermines our global competitiveness, diminishes U.S. export prospects and puts American jobs at risk,\\" said Victoria Espinel, U.S. intellectual-property enforcement coordinator. Corporate officials at the conference welcomed the move as a start. Dean Garfield, CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, an industry group, called the administration's new strategy \\"a catalyst for action,\\" adding, \\"we can do a lot more.\\" Wednesday's move follows an executive order that President Barack Obama signed last week to create voluntary cybersecurity standards for companies running critical infrastructure like the electric grid. Karan Bhatia, a vice president at General Electric Co. voiced support for the administration's new effort—so long as such security standards remain voluntary. The administration had been working on both measures for several months; its announcement coincided with a spike in recent disclosures about cyberinfiltrations of the U.S. news media and critical infrastructure by cyberspies believed to be linked to the Chinese government. \\"This is what you have to do to get the Chinese to behave differently,\\" said James Lewis, a former top State Department official who is now a cybersecurity specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"You've got to keep pushing on them; you've got to keep grinding.\\" But, he cautioned, results will likely take several years. The U.S. had some success in employing a similar strategy of diplomatic and trade pressure in the 1990s to curb Chinese proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related military equipment. In addition to denying it condones computer hacking, China also has said that it is itself a victim of cyberattacks and that Chinese law forbids such attacks. Akamai Technologies, which monitors large amounts of web traffic, said in the third quarter of 2012 China was the world's No. 1 source of observed attack traffic, with 33% of such traffic. The U.S. was second, at 13%. U.S. intelligence agencies issued a rare public report in 2011 that fingered Chinese hackers as the \\"most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage.\\" Senior intelligence officials said the Chinese government and sympathetic hackers are behind the cyberspying. A House intelligence committee report last year concluded the Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technology Co.'s presence in the U.S. poses a national-security threat. Huawei called the congressional report \\"an exercise in China-bashing.\\" As one component of the new strategy, U.S. law-enforcement and intelligence agencies will work more closely with the private sector to school them in counterspying and provide warnings about emerging corporate-espionage threats. The spy agencies will provide reports to the private sector on key aspects of the threat, including the number and identity of foreign governments involved, the industry sectors most targeted, and how the espionage is being conducted. The new U.S. strategy also calls for a more aggressive diplomatic response to the theft of trade secrets, much of which is now done by infiltrating computer networks of target companies. Some is also still done by recruiting human spies. The State Department will ensure that a consistent and \\"appropriate\\" message is delivered to foreign governments to communicate the administration's commitment to reducing the theft of intellectual property and the importance it places on more effective legal penalties and enforcement for trade-secret theft. Wednesday's strategy report said Washington would work with its allies to coordinate on ways to pressure countries like China that the U.S. government says are engaged in rampant theft of intellectual property. That effort will be led by the State and Commerce Departments and the U.S. Trade Representative. The U.S. also will use trade arrangements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership to seek new provisions on trade-secret protections that include penalties similar to those in U.S. law. Mr. Lewis said that over time, the government will probably need to raise pressure with such actions as denying visas to Chinese researchers or denying certain Chinese companies access to U.S. banks. The strategy also directs agencies to evaluate current laws and determine if additional legislation is needed to protect trade secrets. Write to Siobhan Gorman at siobhan.gorman@wsj.com and Jared A.

(1) In September 1994 , Anton Lesley married Gray Anton . (2) In September 1994 , Anton Anton married Lesley Gray . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"These two sentences appear to convey the same core message—that two individuals, Anton and Lesley, got married to each other in September 1994. However, there is some ambiguity in the names due to differences in the ordering and presentation of names in each sentence. Let's break down the potential meanings of each sentence to understand the similarities and differences. (1) In September 1994, Anton Lesley married Gray Anton. In this sentence, the name formatting suggests that the individuals involved in the marriage are \\"Anton Lesley\\" and \\"Gray Anton.\\" We can interpret this as: - Anton Lesley (first name: Anton, last name: Lesley) - Gray Anton (first name: Gray, last name: Anton) (2) In September 1994, Anton Anton married Lesley Gray. In this sentence, the name formatting suggests that the individuals involved in the marriage are \\"Anton Anton\\" and \\"Lesley Gray.\\" We can interpret this as: - Anton Anton (first name: Anton, last name: Anton) - Lesley Gray (first name: Lesley, last name: Gray) Now, if we compare the individuals from the two sentences, problems arise relating to name changes or different name combinations. For instance: - Are Anton Lesley and Anton Anton the same person with an error or inconsistency in the last name? - Does Gray Anton represent a person entirely different from Lesley Gray, or did someone mistakenly order their names or use a different name in place of the right one? While it is plausible that they refer to the same event, involving the same individuals and convey the same intended meaning, the discrepancies in the names make it unclear whether both sentences are actually equivalent. The variations in the names create ambiguity as to whether the two sentences depict the same marriage event or, in fact, different events. Further context or clarification as to the correct names of the individuals would help in determining whether the two sentences genuinely mean the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was built between 1823 and 1827 for King Karl XIV Johan , the first Bernadotte King of Sweden . It was intended as an escape from the formalities of court life at the Royal Palace . Rosendal Palace was largely designed by Fredrik Blom , one of the leading architects of the time , who received a royal commission to draw and build the palace building after the original buildings burned down . Fredrik August Lidströmer , Stockholm 's City Architect from 1818 to 1824 , had been King Karl XIV Johan 's primary architect at the construction of the original Rosendal Palace . After it burned down in 1819 , Lidströmer also created the initial drawings for the replacement palace .

During the summer months the palace is open to visitors for guided tours . - Biography. Early life. It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers Eskil, Karl, and Bengt were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

The owner of a fairground ride which seriously injured two teenagers when it collapsed in mid-air has been ordered to pay a fine of more than £11,000. Conor Baker and Danny Keogh were celebrating finishing their GCSEs with a trip to the fair in Leicester when their carriage suddenly flipped off the ride. The schoolboys were both badly hurt in the accident in July 2012, with Danny spending four days in intensive care. Scroll down for video. Injured: Danny Keogh, left, and Conor Baker, right were hurt in a fairground accident in July 2012. Ride: The pair are pictured second left on the ride at a Leicester fairground. The Health and Safety Executive found that the ride had been poorly maintained in the run-up to the incident, and a court has now fined its owner William Roberts £11,620. Mr Roberts insisted that his rides were so safe that he let his own children use them - but it emerged that a customer had previously been electrocuted due to a malfunction on one of his rides. Conor and Danny were both 16 at the time of the accident at Leicester's Abbey Park, which was caught on camera by a horrified bystander. Video footage shows their carriage flip off the 'Mega Bounce Frog' ride, throwing Danny away and hurling Conor into the protective barrier. The ride - which was filled with children - continued to spin as onlookers screamed for it to stop. Falling: The moment the boys' carriage began to disconnect from the ride, throwing them out. Danny was treated in intensive care following extensive surgery for a collapsed lung, broken arm and deep wounds to his side, which required 88 staples. He also needed stitches in his tongue and chin. After his eight-day hospital ordeal, he told the local newspaper that he had feared for his life in the heat of the moment. 'I tried to remain as calm as possible because I thought to myself, 'There's no way I'm going to die on a fairground ride,'' he said. 'It sounds silly, but that thought drove me to try to stay alive.' He added: 'I'm never going to go on another fair ride as long as I live. I know I am lucky to be alive so I am not going to push it.' Conor suffered a broken nose, broken teeth, cuts to his face and a significant blow to the head. Agony: Conor was thrown into the protective barrier, smashing his nose and teeth. Horror: The boys said they thought they might die during the accident two years ago. An investigation by the HSE found that a clip and pin securing the car to its operating arm had fallen out, leading to the accident. Mr Roberts, from Manchester, was fined £6,500 and ordered to pay costs of £5,000 plus a £120 victim surcharge at Leicester Magistrates' Court yesterday after he admitted breaching health and safety regulations. Speaking after the hearing, HSE inspector Neil Ward said: 'The unsafe condition of the ride resulted in very serious injuries to two young men who had gone out to celebrate finishing their GCSE exams. 'The outcome could have been much worse. It was a horrifying and painful experience for Conor and Danny and extremely distressing for their families, friends and members of the public who witnessed the incident. 'The public rightly expects rides to be safe. The safety-critical defects identified on this machine were very troubling. The inconsistencies in the pin ends were obvious and the pins and clips were safety-critical components that should have been thoroughly checked on a daily basis.'

Write an article based on this summary: The Irish police watchdog, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSOC), has confirmed that its chairman Simon O'Brien is to step down from his post. Article:","completion":"Title: Irish Police Watchdog Chief, Simon O'Brien, Steps Down From Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission Subheading: Simon O'Brien, the Chairman of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, has announced his resignation from the organization amid growing concerns about the agency's performance in dealing with police conduct. Introduction: The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSOC), Ireland's official police watchdog organization, has confirmed that its chairman, Simon O'Brien, has decided to step down from his post. The news comes as a surprise to many given O'Brien's extensive tenure in the role, which spanned more than four years. The resignation is expected to take effect shortly, marking a significant change in leadership for the much-debated GSOC and casting uncertainty over its future direction. Background: The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission was established in 2007 as an independent entity charged with the responsibility of investigating and addressing complaints against the Garda Síochána, Ireland's national police force. The GSOC has been under considerable scrutiny over the years due to its handling of numerous high-profile cases involving alleged police misconduct. The commission is funded by the Irish government and is dedicated to promoting transparency in law enforcement conduct and practices. Simon O'Brien was appointed the Chairman of the GSOC in June 2011. A former detective chief superintendent of the Metropolitan Police in London, O'Brient has had a lengthy and decorated career in law enforcement spanning almost 30 years. Prior to his role at the GSOC, O'Brien served as the Director of Security Industry Authority, the UK's regulator for private security. Reasons for Resignation: While the full details of O'Brien's resignation have not been made public, there are indications that the GSOC has experienced difficulties in the implementation of its mandate in recent times. These challenges include insufficient resources, delays in addressing complaints, and criticisms surrounding the organization's independence from political influences. It is speculated that the growing pressure may have played a role in prompting O'Brien's decision to relinquish his position as Chairman of the agency. Additionally, it is conceivable that the recent negative press about the GSOC could have contributed to the decision, though this has not been confirmed. Impact on the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission: The departure of Simon O'Brien raises concerns about the stability of the GSOC, particularly in terms of its direction, leadership, and operational efficiency. While O'Brien's resignation will not halt the work of the commission, his experience in law enforcement and extensive understanding of the Irish policing landscape has provided a strong foundation for the GSOC's functioning. Consequently, the onus is now on the commission to find a suitable successor who can reaffirm the organization's commitment to transparency and restore public confidence. Conclusion: The announcement of Simon O'Brien's resignation from the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is a significant development that has generated much discussion about the current state and future direction of Ireland's police watchdog. However, it is vital to approach the matter with a measured response and a clear understanding of the importance of ensuring that the commission continues its work effectively and independently.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? You may have noticed an interesting reaction when you tell people you're traveling to Amsterdam. They sometimes get that curious look, that knowing half-smile on their faces. \\"Amsterdam,\\" they say with a mischievous grin, \\"lucky you!\\" Are they thinking about Van Gogh and Rembrandt, about the fabulous museums, the flowing canals, the teeming bicycle paths, the gorgeous tulips -- or is it something else? To many, Amsterdam is synonymous with freedom. With the ability to do what is forbidden in other places. Throwback lodging: Stay in another era Undoubtedly, millions travel to the Netherlands to see the just re-opened Rijksmuseum and its famous \\"Night Watch\\" painting, along with many other attractions of this truly charming city. But, let's face it, Amsterdam conjures another fascination. Decades before anyone else considered legalizing marijuana, prostitution or gay marriage, the Dutch stood -- as they still do today -- at the forefront of change on many controversial social issues, legalizing or tolerating a range of activities that other countries placed squarely outside what they consider legally and socially acceptable.

The correct answer is \\"Dutch debate\\" because it refers to the general population or government of the Netherlands, who would be the ones debating the pros and cons of the plan. The passage discusses how the Dutch have been at the forefront of change regarding controversial social issues, so it is logical that they would have debates about these plans. The incorrect options are: - Amsterdam debate: This would refer specifically to the city of Amsterdam, rather than the entire country of the Netherlands. The passage talks about the Dutch as a whole, not just Amsterdam. - Netherlands debate: This option is overly literal and less commonly used than \\"Dutch debate.\\" It refers to the country but is not the most suitable choice. - Night Watch debate: The \\"Night Watch\\" is a specific painting mentioned in the passage and not relevant to the discussion of social issues. - Rembrandt debate: Rembrandt is an artist, not a term used to describe debates about social issues in the Netherlands. - Rijksmuseum debate: The Rijksmuseum is a museum in the Netherlands, not a term used to describe debates on controversial social issues. - Van Gogh debate: Van Gogh is an artist, not a term used to describe debates about social issues in the Netherlands."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach - The stomach churns the food - With the aid of stomach acids - The food becomes a thick liquid - Is then passed to the small intestine. Question: suppose top layer is more impure happens, how will it affect If more food enters the esophagus. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"A detailed understanding of the digestive process is necessary to answer this question accurately. The process mentioned in the question involves the movement of food from the esophagus to the stomach and then to the small intestine. This process involves several components, including mechanical and chemical breakdown of food. The esophagus is responsible for transporting food from the mouth to the stomach via muscular contractions called peristalsis. Upon entering the stomach, food is churned and mixed with stomach acids (primarily hydrochloric acid) and enzymes (like pepsin). This process helps break down proteins and transform food into a thick liquid called chyme. The chyme then moves into the small intestine, where it is further broken down by various enzymes and absorbed into the bloodstream. The question posits a scenario where the top layer of food in the stomach is more impure. When more impure food arrives from the esophagus, the stomach must contend with the already present impurities as well as the new impurities introduced by additional food. The stomach also experiences increased pressure due to the added volume of food. From the given options, \\"A: more\\" is the most accurate response to the question's scenario. Here's why: A: More With more impure food entering the stomach from the esophagus, the stomach must work harder to break down and process these impurities. Consequently, the stomach may produce more stomach acids and enzymes to tackle the extra impurities present in the food. This could lead to an increase in the time taken for food to be digested and transformed into chyme, eventually affecting the overall digestive process. Additionally, the excess production of stomach acids could potentially irritate the stomach lining, causing discomfort and digestive issues. B: Less Choosing this option implies that the presence of more impure food entering the esophagus will have a reduced effect on the digestive process. However, given that the stomach needs to work harder to break down impurities and process the food, this outcome is not likely. The increased pressure and the need for additional stomach acids and enzymes can cause complications in the digestive process, making it less efficient. C: No Effect This option suggests that if more impure food enters the esophagus, it will have no effect on the digestive process. However, this option is not accurate, as the presence of increased impurities in the stomach can have consequences on the stomach's function, its production of acids and enzymes, and overall digestive health. As mentioned earlier, the stomach may need to work harder to break down and process the increased impurities, leading to digestion-related problems and compromising the efficiency of the digestive process. In conclusion, option A: more is the most accurate answer, as more impure food entering the esophagus and moving into the stomach will likely result in increased effort by the stomach to process the impurities, slower digestion, and potential irritation to the stomach lining."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Start with the numbers from 1 to 5. Add the numbers 6 through 10.","completion":"Title: Mastering the Native Japanese Style of Counting: Steps for Beginners Introduction Learning a new language can be challenging yet rewarding, and understanding the counting system is a critical part of mastering any language. In Japanese, there are various counting methods used depending on the situation and the items being counted. In this article, we will focus on the native Japanese style counting – \\"Wago\\" (和語) – and guide you through the fundamental steps of counting from 1 to 10. Step 1: Familiarize yourself with the native Japanese style counting Before diving into the numbers, it's essential to understand that Japanese has two sets of numerals – the Sino-Japanese numbers (Kango), which are based on the Chinese numeral system, and the native Japanese numbers (Wago). Wago is used in more casual and informal situations, such as counting age, small objects, and general counting. Recognizing when to use Wago is crucial to sounding fluent and natural in your Japanese communication. Step 2: Learn the basics of Wago - numbers 1 to 5 The first step in mastering Wago counting is learning the native Japanese numbers from 1 to 5. These are as follows: 1. ひとつ (Hitotsu) - One 2. ふたつ (Futatsu) - Two 3. みっつ (Mittsu) - Three 4. よっつ (Yottsu) - Four 5. いつつ (Itsutsu) - Five It's essential to practice these numbers diligently, as this will provide you with a strong foundation. To become proficient at counting, try to memorize these numbers and practice using them to count small objects around you, such as coins or pieces of fruit. Step 3: Add numbers 6 through 10 Once you feel confident in your ability to count from 1 to 5 in Wago, let's move on to the next set of numbers - 6 through 10: 6. むっつ (Muttsu) - Six 7. ななつ (Nanatsu) - Seven 8. やっつ (Yattsu) - Eight 9. ここのつ (Kokonotsu) - Nine 10. とう (Tō) - Ten Similar to the numbers 1 through 5, practice these numerals repetitively, experimenting with counting various objects and using them in simple sentences to solidify your memory. Step 4: Apply your knowledge - knowing when to use Wago Understanding when to use Wago is a crucial aspect of mastering native Japanese counting. Generally, Wago is used in everyday conversation and casual settings. Here are some general time when Wago is used: 1. Counting small objects such as marbles, apples, or candies. 2. Expressing the age of a person up to ten years old. 3. Counting animals like birds and fish. 4. Telling time (e.g., one o'clock, two o'clock, etc.) By understanding when to use Wago, you will gain confidence in your Japanese language skills and sound more natural when conversing with native speakers. Conclusion In conclusion, mastering the native Japanese style of counting is an important aspect of learning the Japanese language. Start by building a strong foundation with the basic numbers from 1 to 5, and then progress towards adding numbers 6 through 10. Remember to practice often, immerse yourself in situations where you can apply your knowledge, and always be mindful of when to use Wago in conversation. With dedication and persistence, you will soon have a strong command of Japanese counting and be well on your way to fluency."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: Remember that, unless you were planning to be a stay-at-home mom, you made the decision to balance a career and a family – and that’s a perfectly valid choice. It’s best to come to terms with your decision as quickly as possible, so don’t second guess yourself! Let go of your guilt, and you’ll be more likely to go back to work with the right mindset. Once you go back to work, your time with your baby will be limited, so use the rest of your maternity leave to bond as much as possible: hold and cuddle your baby, sing and laugh and make faces with your baby, and enjoy the extended time that you have together. There are plenty of ways to continue bonding with your baby once you go back to work. You can start preparing now. Consider: Waking up earlier in the morning and spending some quality time cuddling with your baby before you start getting ready for the day. Turning routine chores and activities into bonding opportunities. For example, you might work to make breakfast or bath time a special shared time for you and your baby. Talking to your baby about your routine. Smiling at your baby during routine moments. The happier and more interactive you are, the more content your baby will be. Dependable childcare is crucial to your success at work, and you won’t feel comfortable unless you know that the person caring for your baby is someone you can trust. Ask family and friends if they are available to provide childcare, or if they have recommendations for childcare providers. Ask potential childcare providers for references, and follow up to learn as much as possible about the person who may be caring for your child. If you are considering a daycare facility, go for at least one tour, and ask if you can sit in and watch a typical day. Make arrangements for back-up childcare. Ideally, a friend or relative will be able to take your baby on short notice if, for some reason, your regular childcare falls through. If not, research drop-in childcare options and ask people you know for suggestions. Check to see if your company offers childcare benefits. Some employers do offer childcare at the office; others offer financial help with the cost. Summary:","completion":"It's okay to choose to have a job and a family. Be happy with your choice, and don't feel guilty. Enjoy your time with your baby while you are at home. When you go back to work, find ways to still bond with your baby.

In Canada, Jane Bullard inherits the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, who are on a losing streak; her star player, Darren Roanoke, has been playing badly ever since his wife Prudence left him for the rival Los Angeles Kings player, Jacques \\"Lè Cocq\\" Grandé. Jane is a big fan of Pitka's, and offers to pay him 2 million to patch up Darren's marriage, so the team can win the Stanley Cup. Pitka's agent tells him that if he succeeds, Oprah will have him on her show. Pitka encourages the rival team to beat Darren up during a game, to distract him from his distress over his wife's affair. Darren begins to play well but then gets suspended for the next two games after beating up Le Cocq, and hitting Coach Cherkov with a hockey puck. Later, Pitka has dinner with Jane. He tries to kiss her, only to hear a ding on his chastity belt. Upset when he tells her their love cannot be, she runs out. Pitka advises Darren to write an apology to Prudence, and fights off a rooster to deliver the letter. After they lose three games, Coach Cherkoff berates Jane and punches Pitka in the groin. He is only slightly injured from hitting the chastity belt but Pitka moans and drops to the ground.

Article: One day, a man found the cocoon of a butterfly and he brought it home. A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little - then fly! Question: Why couldn't the butterfly fly? Because _ .

Question 1: I want to bring my fiancé to the US to marry but he has overstayed his visa in the uk for 7 months. Will we be denied a fiancé visa? Question 2: If I'm waiting on a k1 fiance visa to process can I still visit the US on my tourist visa? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"I am not a legal expert, but I can provide you with a general idea of what information is relevant to your situation. Question 1: Will we be denied a fiancé visa if my fiancé has overstayed his visa in the UK for 7 months? Step 1: Consider the general eligibility requirements for a fiancé visa (K-1 visa) in the US: - The petitioner must be a US citizen - Both individuals must be free to marry (not currently married) - The couple must have met in person within the past two years, with some exceptions - The foreign fiancé meets the admissibility criteria to enter the US Step 2: Determine how the visa overstay in the UK might affect the process: - An overstay in another country might not directly impact the fiancé visa process in the US - However, the overstay may result in complications when assessing the admissibility criteria Step 3: Evaluate any potential impact on the fiancé visa process in the US: - Possible consequences of the overstay may include being deemed inadmissible due to unlawful presence, which could pose challenges in the visa approval process Conclusion: While it is not guaranteed that your fiancé will be denied a fiancé visa due to the visa overstay in the UK, it may raise complications during the application process. It is advisable to consult with an immigration attorney to get a more accurate assessment of your personal situation. Question 2: If I'm waiting on a K-1 fiancé visa to process, can I still visit the US on my tourist visa? Step 1: Consider the purpose of the tourist visa (B-2 visa): - B-2 visas are granted for temporary visits for pleasure and not for immigration purposes Step 2: Assess the potential issues with visiting the US on a tourist visa while waiting for the K-1 fiancé visa: - Immigration officers may suspect intent to immigrate on the B-2 visa, which could result in denial of entry Step 3: Evaluate the likelihood of entry to the US on a tourist visa in this context: - Entry on a tourist visa is not guaranteed and depends on the discretion of immigration officers - Proof of strong ties to your home country and intent to return after the visit may help in gaining entry Conclusion: Visiting the US on a tourist visa while awaiting the K-1 fiancé visa process is not impossible, but it may involve risks and is subject to the discretion of immigration officers. Demonstrating your intent to return to your home country after the visit may improve your chances of entry. Regarding whether the answer to these two questions is the same: No, the answers are not the same. The first question focuses on the potential impact of a visa overstay in the UK on obtaining a fiancé visa, while the second question discusses the feasibility of visiting the US on a tourist visa while awaiting a K-1 fiancé visa. Both situations involve different considerations and potential complications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Tepehuán suffered a series of devastating epidemics of European-introduced diseases in the years before the revolt. Epidemics were known to have occurred in their region in 1594, 1601-1602, 1606-1607, 1610, and 1616-1617. The Tepehuán and their neighbors may have been reduced in population by more than 80 percent by the epidemics, from a pre-Columbian population of more than 100,000 to fewer than 20,000, of which the Tepehuán may have been one-half of this total During the Chichimeca war the Tepehuán remained neutral although urged by the Chichimecas to join them in resistance to Spanish expansion. The Spanish failed to defeat the Chichimeca militarily and instituted a new policy called \\"peace by purchase\\" in which Catholic missionaries would be a major tool in pacifying hostile and semi-hostile Indians. Indians were to be supplied with food and tools and resettled into towns. Missionaries, rather than the military, would take on most of the responsibility for integrating the Indians into Mexican and Christian society.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process, after the cake has been baked for the required time, would be to remove it from the oven. To ensure it's fully baked, you can do a toothpick test where you insert a toothpick (or a skewer) into the center of the cake – it should come out clean or with a few crumbs clinging to it. If it's still wet, the cake needs more baking time. After removing it from the oven, let the cake cool in the tin for around 10-15 minutes, then transfer it onto a wire rack to cool down completely. This is important as it allows the cake to firm up and makes it easier to frost (if desired). If you frost while it’s still hot, the frosting or icing can melt. Once the cake is cooled, you may frost and decorate the cake as desired. This would mark the final step in the cake baking process.

Being in a city ensures that they have access to the latest technologies and communication facilities, which are crucial for their operations. 3. Access to resources and talent: Large cities attract talented professionals in various fields because of the availability of job opportunities and a higher quality of life. For radio stations, this means easier access to talent, technicians, and other professionals necessary to run a successful studio. 4. Presence of media companies: Large cities often have a strong presence of various media companies, including print, television, and radio. This media ecosystem not only provides support and resources to radio studios but also enables easy access to news and information that can be broadcasted to the listeners. 5. Cultural diversity and events: Large cities are known for their cultural diversity, hosting various events and activities throughout the year. Radio studios can capitalize on these events by providing coverage and content that appeals to a wide range of local and global audiences.

Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical...

The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians. - A decree is a rule of law usually issued by a head of state (such as the president of a republic or a monarch), according to certain procedures (usually established in a constitution). It has the force of law. The particular term used for this concept may vary from country to country. The \\"executive orders\\" made by the President of the United States, for example, are decrees (although a decree is not exactly an order). In non-legal English usage, however, the term refers to any authoritarian decision. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Lille is a city in northern France, in French Flanders. On the Deûle River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region and the prefecture of the Nord department. - Northern Italy is a cultural and geographical region, without any administrative purpose, used to indicate the northern part of the Italian state, also informally referred as \\"Il Nord\\", \\"Settentrione\\" or \\"Alta Italia\\". It consists of 8 regions in northern Italy: Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. According to the 2011 census, its population was 27,213,372. For statistic purposes, the Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT) uses the term Northwest Italy and Northeast Italy for identifying two of the five statistical regions in its reporting.

The historical importance of Roman law is reflected by the continued use of Latin legal terminology in many legal systems influenced by it. - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France. - The scholars of the 11th and 12th century legal schools in Italy, France and Germany are identified as glossators in a specific sense. They studied Roman Law based on the \\"Digestae\\", the \\"Codex\\" of Justinian, the \\"Authenticae\\" (an abridged Latin translation of selected constitutions of Justinian, promulgated in Greek after the enactment of the \\"Codex\\" and therefore called \\"Novellae\\"), and his law manual, the \\"Institutiones Iustiniani\\", compiled together in the Corpus Iuris Civilis. (This title is itself only a sixteenth-century printers' invention.) Their work transformed the inherited ancient texts into a living tradition of Medieval Roman Law - French Guiana (pronounced or ), officially called Guiana, is an overseas department and region of France, located on the north Atlantic coast of South America in the Guyanas. It borders Brazil to the east and south, and Suriname to the west. Its area has a very low population density of only 3 inhabitants per km, with half of its 244,118 inhabitants in 2013 living in the metropolitan area of Cayenne, its capital. By land area, it is the second largest region of France and the largest outermost region within the European Union. - Toulouse is the capital city of the southwestern French department of Haute-Garonne, as well as of the Occitanie region. The city lies on the banks of the River Garonne, from the Mediterranean Sea, from the Atlantic Ocean, and from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France with 466,297 inhabitants in January 2014. The Toulouse Metro area is, with 1 312 304 inhabitants as of 2014, France's 4th metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon and Marseille and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux. - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences. - Bologna (; ) is the largest city (and the capital) of the Emilia-Romagna Region in Northern Italy. It is the seventh most populous city in Italy, located in the heart of a metropolitan area (officially recognized by the Italian government as a \\"città metropolitana\\") of about one million. - Franciscus Accursius (12251293) was an Italian lawyer, the son of the celebrated jurist and glossator Accursius. The two are often confused. - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people. - Bordeaux (Gascon Occitan: \\"\\") is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France. - Ancient Rome was an Italic civilization that began on the Italian Peninsula as early as the 8th century BC. Located along the Mediterranean Sea and centered on the city of Rome, it expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population) and covering 5.0 million square kilometers at its height in AD 117. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - Jurisdiction (from the Latin \\"ius, \\" meaning \\"law\\" and \\"\\" meaning \\"to speak\\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law. - Odofredus ( died 3 December 1265 ) was an Italian jurist . He was born in Ostia and moved to Bologna in which studied law under Jacobus Balduinus and Franciscus Accursius . After having practised as an advocate both in Italy and France , he became a law professor at Bologna in 1228 . The commentaries on Roman law attributed to him are valuable as showing the growth of the study of law in Italy , and for their biographical details of the jurists of the 12th and 13th centuries . Odofredus died at Bologna in 1265 . Odofredus is famous for the personal remarks with which he sprinkled his teaching , often introduced by Or signori , \`\` Listen , gentlemen '' . Perhaps his most famous saying is : \`\` Everybody wants to know , but nobody wants to know the price of knowledge '' . Under his name appeared the following works , which had already been printed in the late fifteenth century : Lecturae in Codicem ( Lyons , 1480 ) Lecturae in Digestum Vetus ( Paris , 1504 ) Summa de libellis formandis ( Strassburg , 1510 ) Lecturae in Tres Libros ( Venice , 1514 ) Lecturae in Digestum Novum ( Lyons , 1552 ) - Accursius (in Italian Accursio, Accorso or also Accorso di Bagnolo; c. 11821263) was a Roman jurist. He is notable for his organization of the glosses, the medieval comments on Justinian's codification of Roman law, the \\"Corpus Juris Civilis\\". He was not proficient in the classics, but he was called \\"the Idol of the Jurisconsults\\". - Politics (from Greek: Politiká: P\\"olitika\\", definition \\"affairs of the cities\\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. - Nice (; Niçard , classical norm, or \\"\\", nonstandard, ) is the fifth most populous city in France and the capital of the Alpes-Maritimes \\"département\\".

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. There are many non-incandescent light sources, such as the fluorescent lamp, high-intensity discharge lamps and LED lamps, which have higher luminous efficiency, and some have been designed to be retrofitted in fixtures for incandescent lights. These devices produce light by luminescence. These lamps produce discrete spectral lines and do not have the broad \\"tail\\" of invisible infrared emissions. By careful selection of which electron energy level transitions are used, and fluorescent coatings which modify the spectral distribution, the spectrum emitted can be tuned to mimic the appearance of incandescent sources, or other different color temperatures of white light. Due to the discrete spectral lines rather than a continuous spectrum, the light is not ideal for applications such as photography and cinematography. How can luminescent light sources be modified to resemble the appearance of incandescents?","completion":"To modify luminescent light sources such as fluorescent lamps, high-intensity discharge lamps, and LED lamps to resemble the appearance of incandescent light sources, several steps can be taken. These steps aim at adjusting the emitted spectrum to mimic the continuous spectrum and warm white color temperature of incandescent lights. Step 1: Selection of electron energy level transitions By carefully selecting the electron energy level transitions within the luminescent material, it is possible to control the specific wavelengths of light produced. Choose transitions that generate light wavelengths similar to those found in incandescent light sources, which predominantly emit warm white light with a color temperature of around 2700K to 3000K. Step 2: Application of fluorescent coatings or phosphors Apply fluorescent coatings or phosphors to the interior of the lamp or on the LED chips that can absorb and re-emit the initial light produced by the luminescent material at different wavelengths. This process, called \\"phosphor conversion,\\" broadens the spectral distribution of the light emitted. Step 3: Adjusting color rendition properties For lighting applications that require accurate color representation, like photography and cinematography, it is essential to ensure that the modified luminescent light source has an appropriate color rendering index (CRI). Aim for a CRI value of at least 80 to 90, which is considered acceptable for most applications. High-quality LED lamps can achieve a CRI value of 95 or more, closely resembling the performance of incandescent lamps. Step 4: Controlling light intensity and dimmability Incandescent lamps are inherently dimmable, allowing users to adjust the intensity and color temperature of the emitted light. To achieve the same functionality with luminescent light sources, incorporate dimmable drivers or ballasts into the lamp design. Note that not all luminescent sources work well with dimmers, so it's essential to select compatible components and ensure that the performance matches that of incandescent lamps. Step 5: Evaluating the overall performance Before implementing the modified luminescent light source, verify its performance by comparing it to an incandescent source. Measure the color temperature, CRI value, and spectral distribution to ensure that the modifications effectively mimic the attributes of incandescent lighting. In conclusion, by selecting appropriate electron energy level transitions, applying fluorescent coatings or phosphors, adjusting color rendition properties, controlling light intensity and dimmability, and evaluating overall performance, it is possible to modify luminescent light sources to resemble the appearance of incandescent lights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who had a horse named Lightning taken away? , can you please find it? Sonora Webster lives with her sister and abusive aunt during the Great Depression. She learns that because of her accidentally letting the cows loose and her suspension from school, her treasured horse Lightning has been sold and she will be placed in an orphanage. Instead, Sonora slips out of the house during the night. She ends up at a county fair and sees a performance by Marie, a diving girl who rides a horse off a platform, and aspires to do the same. Doc Carver, Marie's employer, tells her she is too young but gives Sonora a job as a stable hand due to her ability with horses, and she begins traveling with them. Doc's son Al wins a wild horse in a card game and Sonora names him Lightning. She later surprises Doc by taming and riding Lightning, so he promises to train her as a diving girl if she can mount it while it's moving, which she succeeds after multiple attempts. Marie falls and dislocates her shoulder, leaving her unable to perform, and Sonora steps in. Although she has never dived with Lightning, their first jump is successful. Marie becomes jealous, and as Doc tires of her diva-like behavior, she quits rather than share billing with Sonora. Al develops a romance with Sonora that strains his relationship with his father, leaving after a particularly bad fight. Al promises to write to Sonora, but Doc hides his letters. As Doc and the new stable hand Clifford leave the farm in search of work, Lightning falls ill with colic. Al returns, and he and Sonora work together to heal Lightning.

It's based on a true story, and though I was irritated by the one-note depiction i.e. ever scowling, of the title character, and the hard-to-believe dedication of her lawyer, I'm forced to accept that life does imitate art, and that there are people out there like that. The movie succeeds, for me, because, although there's little softening of the title character's demeanour until almost the end, one is gradually moved to sympathy for her, as the movie shows how she got to her present state - which proves to be self-destructive, rather than anti-social. Truly a moving movie, which will bring a lump to your throat, when you think on it - which will be often. Despite its many flaws,(including that it's hard to watch, sometimes, because of bodily functions, and suicide attempts)this is another production that I'm proud to call Canadian. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"I would say this review is positive.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: fresh pineapple for long-term storage. You can prolong the life of your pineapple for as much as 12 months by freezing it. You will need to remove the skin and the core of the pineapple first. Once the skin and core are removed from the pineapple, store it in an airtight container like Tupperware. Leave a small amount of air in the container with the pineapple. If you happen to have a dehydrator, you can prepare and store your pineapple nearly indefinitely! Dehydrating removes the moisture from the pineapple and makes it a bit more like pineapple “chips” but with all the same nutritional value. Use a sharp knife to peel, core and slice your pineapple. Make sure your slices are consistently about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick. Place in your dehydrator according to the manufacturer's recommendation or at 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius) until the fruit reaches a leathery state but is not sticky. It may take 12-18 hours to be fully dehydrated. The last possible method to storing your pineapple for an extended period of time is canning. Canning or jarring your pineapple can prolong its life for a year or more, but it is not recommended to store it for longer than a year to be safe. Once again, slice and core your pineapple by cutting off the top and skins. This time, cutting the pineapple into chunks instead of slices may make it easier to can. You will need to boil your pineapple in a “packing” solution to occupy the additional space in the can and keep it moisturized. You can use apple juice, white grape juice or light to medium “canning syrup” you can buy at some specialty grocery stores. After boiling the pineapple in the packing solution, fill your jars, leaving an inch or so of open space at the top. Place the lids on the jars finger tight, then place it (or however many you have) in a pot with water approximately 1-2 inches taller than the top of the jar or can. Boil the jars for 25 minutes for a pint jar, 30 minutes for quarts. After removing them, the air will have been evacuated and the pineapple will be good to store.","completion":"This article is about different ways to store fresh pineapple for a long time, like freezing, dehydrating, or canning it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Get it and read it! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review depicts the product, which is a book in this case, in a generally flattering light. There are several reasons for this analysis: 1. The reviewer states that the book is \\"well written and well researched.\\" 2. They feel that the book presents both Netscape's and Microsoft's arguments fairly, acknowledging the mistakes made by both parties. 3. Despite the reviewer's personal bias against Microsoft and favor for Netscape, the fact that they found value and fairness in the book suggests it has merit. 4. The reviewer also encourages others to \\"Get it and read it!\\" It's worth noting that the reviewer did point out that the book does concentrate more on Netscape, but they seemed to feel this was justified given the context of the 'battle'.

Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.\\" Answer:","completion":"Various scholars, monks, and practitioners have studied the Mahayana over its long history. Initially, it was the bodhisattvas who followed the Mahayana ideals and doctrines, focusing on cultivating compassion and aiding all sentient beings to achieve enlightenment. Many Chinese monks, such as Xuanzang and Yijing, traveled to India to study the Mahayana and its texts, thus helping to spread its teachings throughout East Asia.

It's no surprise that a lack of sleep can cause irritability and changes in mood. You may actually develop a mood disorder if you're consistently sleep deprived.","completion":"As your body craves rest to rejuvenate and recharge, persistent sleep deprivation can manifest itself through certain physical ailments, behavioral shifts, and cognitive impairments, often making it difficult to perform daily tasks efficiently and maintain mental and emotional stability. One key sign to look out for is excessive daytime sleepiness. If you find yourself constantly yawning, struggling to keep your eyes open, and feeling drowsy throughout the day, despite having a good night's sleep, then you may be suffering from sleep deprivation. This desire to sleep intruding on waking hours can indicate that your body is not receiving the necessary sleep required for optimal functioning. Additionally, you may experience difficulty concentrating and retaining critical information, as sleep plays an essential role in consolidating memory and learning. Complex problem-solving skills, decision-making, and creativity can be considerably inhibited when you're not receiving adequate amounts of sleep, leading to a noticeable impact on your work performance, academic progress, or personal endeavors. Another noticeable sign of sleep deprivation is a decline in your emotional well-being. Experiencing mood swings, irritability, and heightened emotional reactivity can be the result of insufficient sleep, as the brain's emotional processing and regulation centers are negatively influenced by the lack of proper rest. This compromised emotional state can put a strain on personal relationships and even lead to the development of certain mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression, if sleep deprivation persists. Furthermore, individuals suffering from sleep deprivation may exhibit signs of weakened immune function, making them more susceptible to illnesses and infections. An impaired immune system can have a knock-on effect on your overall health, and in severe cases of chronic sleep deprivation, can increase the risk of developing conditions such as type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. It's also essential to consider the impact of sleep deprivation on your motor skills, coordination, and reaction time. When you're not receiving enough restorative sleep, your brain's ability to process and transmit information becomes impaired, leading to slower reaction times and reduced alertness. This poses a significant risk when operating machinery, driving, or engaging in other tasks that demand precision and concentration. In summary, detecting sleep deprivation requires vigilance and careful observation of your cognitive, emotional, and physical well-being. By recognizing these signs and taking steps towards implementing healthier sleep practices, you can ensure that you receive the crucial rest your body and mind need to perform at their best and maintain overall health and wellness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In an interview Sunday morning on CBS' \\"Face the Nation,\\" Obama said he had not reviewed the language of the latest proposal, but said if the core principles he put forth were incorporated into it, his \\"inclination\\" would be to vote for it; but he added \\"I'm not happy about it.

One wagon breaks formation and forks off on its own trail. As it does, we hear Missie LaHaye (Erin Cottrell) reading from a letter she's writing to her father (Dale Midkiff) about how, after two years of marriage, she and (her husband) Willie (Logan Bartholomew) are leaving the wagon train and heading out alone to set down roots on the land Willie purchased four years ago. She writes he will be a grandfather soon, but she hasnt told Willie she is expecting a baby because he has so much on his mind. August isnt a good time to set up a ranch, but she was able to get in a year of teaching before they joined the wagon train and the extra money will help with expenses.The couple arrives in Tettsford Junction, where there is little sign of life except for the pens of livestock and a coop of chickens, bordering a row of rough storefronts and residential shacks. Four years ago Willie came through the town on a cattle drive and chose a piece of land to call his own. As promised, if he and Missie can live on and improve the land for five years, it will be rightfully theirs. Many have come before them in the same attempt, but Willie and Missie are determined to make it work.When they arrive at their land, uncertainty spreads over them. The land is covered with tumbleweeds and the ranch house is in bad shape. Unwilling to show each other concern, Willie and Missie keep a straight face and forge ahead. Willie takes out all their money and tells her that theyre going to buy their cattle and hire hands and then bury the rest. The money is crucial to their survival.Willie gives Missie the shotgun for safety and heads into town to get their mail and hire help.

I was prepared to laugh throughout this movie like a Mystery Science Theater experiment, but it was just boring. It appears that the producers had many biker enthusiast friends, and from there casually decided to make a movie. It is frequently unwatchable. Lots of footage of the bikers riding on a dirt road, with the same music played repeatedly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is barely in the movie. Harmon probably would have livened things up. Perhaps she had other commitments the day this was filmed. Of course, the bikers terrorize a small town. Fights, murder, a cowardly cop, a goofy mechanic, etc. One of the bikers always wears a football helmet, a weak attempt to distinguish him from all the other outlaws. The script has nothing to offer. One scene features a biker assaulting a woman, yelling in the lady's face \\"You're all the same! You're all the same!\\". We come back to the scene a minute later and he again declares \\"You're all the same!\\". Couldn't the writer think of something more creative to say??

Driving out west in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster, Stone swerves to miss a cow on the highway and crashes uncontrollably into the fence of a local resident in the rural hamlet of Grady, South Carolina.

[b]. no.","completion":"[a]. Yes, the statement \\"The dog's limp ears may be the result of atrophy of the jaw muscles.\\" can be considered as a correct answer to the question \\"Dogs having ears that are not erect may be due to what?\\" Here's a detailed explanation: In some cases, dogs that have ears that are not erect can be a result of atrophy of the jaw muscles. The muscles in a dog's jaw are closely connected to the ear muscles, and if there's any kind of degeneration or atrophy of the jaw muscles, it could lead to limp ears. However, it is essential to consider that atrophy of the jaw muscles is just one of the possible causes for limp ears in dogs, and there could be several other reasons. Erect ears are an innate trait in certain breeds, like the German Shepherd and the Siberian Husky. However, other factors can influence whether a dog has erect or limp ears, including genetics, ear infections, injuries, or ear cropping, among others. Here is a list of some potential causes of limp ears in dogs: 1. Genetics: Some dog breeds have naturally floppy ears due to their genetic makeup. Breeds like Beagles, Basset Hounds, and Cocker Spaniels have ears that are not erect. 2. Age: Puppies often have floppy ears that may become erect as they grow older. The cartilage in their ears strengthens and thickens over time, which can help the ears become erect. 3. Ear infections: Infections in the ear can cause inflammation and discomfort, which can make the ears appear limp. These infections need to be treated by a veterinarian to prevent further complications. 4. Injuries: Trauma to the ear or head can result in limp ears. The trauma might affect the cartilage or muscles in the ears, leading to a temporary or permanent change in the ear's appearance. 5. Ear cropping: Some dog breeds, like Dobermans and Great Danes, have their ears cropped for aesthetic or historical/traditional reasons. This surgical procedure involves cutting off part of the ear flap and reshaping the remaining cartilage to create a more erect appearance. In conclusion, while the statement \\"The dog's limp ears may be the result of atrophy of the jaw muscles.\\" is a correct answer to the question, it's essential to remember that several other factors could contribute to dogs having ears that are not erect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They often have dedicated spaces for artistic performances, lectures, and other cultural events to enrich the campus life experience and overall education of students, faculty, and the community. Within a university setting, it is common to find spaces such as concert halls, auditoriums, or theaters specifically designed for live music performances, ranging from showcasing student talent to hosting professional musicians or orchestras. These events contribute to the artistic and cultural development of the university and the surrounding community and also serve as an educational resource for students studying music or related fields. Additionally, the presence of a music or performing arts department within a university is a strong indication that there will be performance spaces tailored to the students' and faculty's needs. These concert halls offer a suitable environment for practice, rehearsal, and performance opportunities.

Background: The Powhatan People (sometimes Powhatans) (also spelled Powatan) are an Indigenous group traditionally from Virginia. In some instances, The Powhatan, may refer to one of the leaders of the people. This is most commonly the case in historical writings by the English. The Powhatans have also been known as Virginia Algonquians, as the Powhatan language is an eastern-Algonquian language also known as Virginia Algonquian. Context: The capital village of \\"Powhatan\\" was believed to be in the present-day Powhatan Hill section of the eastern part of Richmond, Virginia, or perhaps nearby in a location which became part of Tree Hill Farm. Another major center of the confederacy about 75 miles (121 km) to the east was called Werowocomoco. It was located near the north bank of the York River in present-day Gloucester County. Werowocomoco was described by the English colonists as only 15 miles (24 km) as the crow flies from Jamestown, but also described as 25 miles (40 km) downstream from present-day West Point, measurements which conflict with each other. In 2003 archaeologists initiated excavations at a site in Gloucester County that have revealed an extensive indigenous settlement from about 1200 (the late Woodland period) through the early Contact period. Work since then has added to their belief that this is the location of Werowocomoco. The site is on a farm bordering on Purtain Bay of the York River, about 12 nautical miles (22 km) from Jamestown. The more than 50 acres (200,000 m2) residential settlement extends up to 1,000 feet (300 m) back from the river. In 2004, researchers excavated two curving ditches of 200 feet (60 m) at the far edge, which were constructed about 1400 CE. In addition to extensive artifacts from hundreds of years of indigenous settlement, researchers have found a variety of trade goods related to the brief interaction of Native Americans and English in the early years of Jamestown. Around 1609, Wahunsunacock shifted his capital from Werowocomoco to Orapakes, located in a swamp at the head of the Chickahominy River, near the modern-day interchange of Interstate 64 and Interstate 295. Sometime between 1611 and 1614, he moved further north to Matchut, in present-day King William County on the north bank of the Pamunkey River, not far from where his brother Opechancanough ruled one of the member tribes at Youghtanund. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there are several other interesting aspects about this article: 1. Powhatan languages and culture: The article highlights that the Powhatan people spoke an eastern-Algonquian language also known as Virginia Algonquian. This language and its associated culture are significant as they represent the Indigenous heritage of Virginia. 2. Multiple centers of the Powhatan confederacy: The article mentions two major centers: Powhatan's capital village in present-day Powhatan Hill, Richmond, and Werowocomoco near the York River. This illustrates the geographical extent of the Powhatan confederacy in Virginia and the importance of these locations. 3. Archaeological work at Werowocomoco: The 2003 excavations and subsequent research have provided valuable insights into the Indigenous settlement from the late Woodland period through the early Contact period. Trade goods found at the site, such as English and Native American artifacts, indicate the interaction between these two groups during the founding of Jamestown. 4. Shift of capitals by Wahunsunacock: Wahunsunacock, also known as Chief Powhatan, moved his capital multiple times - from Werowocomoco to Orapakes and then to Matchut. This movement indicates the shifting political landscape of the Powhatan confederacy during the early 17th century and its interaction with the English settlers. These aspects contribute to our understanding of the Powhatan people, their culture, and their relationships with other Indigenous groups and European settlers in the region. The research findings hold significant implications for Native American history and the broader history of colonial America."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit.

Possible A: dewey decimal system, book, library, newspaper, internet Why is \\"book\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Book\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because, in the old days, books were one of the primary sources of documented information, knowledge, and entertainment. Before the internet and digital media, people relied heavily on books to acquire new information, learn about various topics, and share stories. Books have been used to preserve and disseminate human knowledge for a very long time, dating back to the invention of writing and the development of various manuscript traditions. Given that books have been a crucial medium of information exchange and storage throughout history, it makes sense that someone in the old days would turn to a book as a primary source of information. Furthermore, books are portable, which means people could carry them, share them, and read them at their leisure, making them an accessible and reliable means of obtaining information. In comparison to other possible answers, a \\"book\\" is more aligned with human common sense in the context of seeking information in the old days: - Dewey Decimal System: This is a library classification system, rather than a source of information itself. It helps organize books and other resources within libraries, but people would actually use the books and resources found through the system, not the system itself, for information. - Library: A library is a place where people could find books, newspapers, and other print resources. While it is a source of information in a broader sense, the actual information comes from books and other materials found within the library. - Newspaper: This is a more specific type of \\"book,\\" as it is a periodical publication containing news and other information. Newspapers were indeed a common source of information in the old days, but \\"book\\" serves as a broader and more encompassing answer. - Internet: This is not a suitable answer for finding information in the old days because the internet was not available or widely accessible until the late 20th century.

Context: Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows.

Write an article with the title: \\"Arsenal 1-2 Borussia Dortmund\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Arsenal 1-2 Borussia Dortmund: A Mesmerizing Clash of Football Titans INTRODUCTION Last night, football enthusiasts were treated to a captivating duel between two of Europe's most potent teams: Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund. The Champions League group stage game saw German team Borussia Dortmund triumph over English Premier League side Arsenal with a thrilling scoreline of 1-2. The highly anticipated match did not disappoint, offering edge-of-the-seat excitement and a phenomenal display of tactics, skill, and mental resilience. FIRST HALF: THE BATTLE COMMENCES As the match commenced, both teams demonstrated their fierce determination to secure a win in this pivotal group stage encounter. Spearheaded by skippers, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal and Marco Reus of Borussia Dortmund, the players put up a high-paced and relentless performance, constantly probing for weaknesses in their opponent's defense. Arsenal struck first in the 27th minute, as Aubameyang finished a silky combination of passes with a delicate chip past Dortmund goalkeeper, Roman Bürki. The goal seemed to awaken Dortmund's attacking instincts, and they responded with a barrage of offensive moves. However, thanks to stellar performances from Arsenal's goalkeeper, Bernd Leno, and center-back pairing, Gabriel and Ben White, the Gunners managed to hold onto their narrow lead until halftime. SECOND HALF: DORTMUND'S COMEBACK After the break, Borussia Dortmund emerged rejuvenated and reenergized, as they began to dictate the tempo and impose themselves on the game. Manager Marco Rose made a decisive tactical change, introducing the pacey winger, Thorgan Hazard, to stretch Arsenal's defense and exploit the spaces left by their marauding fullbacks. The change paid dividends in the 68th minute when a precise cross from Hazard found the head of Erling Haaland, Dortmund's talismanic striker. Haaland rose above his markers and powered a header into the net, bringing the score level at 1-1. With the momentum now firmly in Dortmund's favor, Arsenal struggled to assert themselves in the game. The home crowd sensed the urgency and passionately urged their team forward, but the German side's defense, led by the seasoned Mats Hummels, remained resolute and unyielding. THE DECISIVE BLOW As the match entered its final stages, Arsenal's attempts to regain control became increasingly desperate. Their high defensive line left them vulnerable to counter-attacks – something Dortmund was keen to exploit. In the 87th minute, Dortmund launched another blistering break as the indomitable Haaland weaved his way past two Arsenal players before releasing an inch-perfect pass to Reus, who calmly slotted the ball beyond the outstretched arms of Leno to secure a dramatic 2-1 victory for Borussia Dortmund. CONCLUSION: A HARD-FOUGHT VICTORY The pulsating encounter showcased the playstyles and unique strengths of both Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund, offering football fans an exhilarating spectacle of attacking flair and polished defending. While Dortmund's tactical changes and unyielding determination played a crucial role in their thrilling come-from-behind victory, Arsenal's performance also deserved plaudits, especially in the first half. With both teams now looking ahead to their next Champions League fixtures, Arsenal will take heart from their moments of brilliance and seek to bounce back quickly. Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund will relish the victory and look to build on this momentum as they continue their pursuit of European glory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This impressive range spans approximately 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) and covers a vast area across several countries, including Romania, Ukraine, Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, Serbia, and Hungary. The Carpathian Mountains are known for their rich biodiversity, significantly contributing to Europe's natural landscapes and resources. The Carpathian Mountains are divided into three primary sections: the Eastern, Western, and Southern Carpathians. Each of these sections boasts different geological features, natural habitats, and cultural aspects. In terms of highest peaks, the Carpathian Mountains cannot compete with the tallest mountain ranges in Europe, but they are still remarkable. Gerlachovský štít in Slovakia, standing at 2,655 meters (8,711 feet), is the highest peak in the range. The Carpathian Mountains are also home to one of the largest continuous forests in Europe, making them an essential habitat for various plant and animal species. Brown bears, wolves, and European bison can be found living in these lush forests. Additionally, the Carpathians host some rare and endangered species like the Carpathian chamois, as well as numerous UNESCO World Heritage Sites and natural parks protected for their cultural and biological significance. As for the longest mountain range in Europe, that title belongs to the Alps, stretching approximately 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) across eight countries. The Alps are distinguished for their spectacular peaks and vast landscapes, shaping European geography, culture, and history for centuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation -50*p - 107 + 407 = 0 for the variable p, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation First, let's simplify the equation by combining the constants: -50*p - 107 + 407 = 0 -50*p + 300 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable p Next, we need to get p alone on one side of the equation. To do this, we will move the constant 300 to the other side of the equation. We can achieve this by adding -300 to both sides: -50*p + 300 - 300 = 0 - 300 -50*p = -300 Step 3: Solve for p Now that p is isolated, we can solve for its value by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p, which in this case is -50: (-50*p) / (-50) = (-300) / (-50) p = 6 So, the solution to the equation -50*p - 107 + 407 = 0 is p = 6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Laurel and Hardy are seated at a dockside where Stan is fishing. Ollie sees a notice in a newspaper which says one Ebeneezer Laurel has died and left a large estate. Parties interested in the estate should go to the Laurel mansion for the reading of the will. Stan can't remember if Ebeneezer is a relative or not but they decide to go to the mansion anyway. They arrive during a thunderstorm and discover that Ebeneezer had been murdered and that the police had placed the notice in the newspaper to draw all of the relatives together to find out who committed the crime. Stan and Ollie are shown to a bedroom to sleep overnight, which is the room in which Ebeneezer was murdered. They hear a strange noise and in the darkness see a pair of eyes which turns out to be a cat. They then hear a scream and decide to investigate. Meanwhile, the butler is calling all of the relatives to a study telling them they have a phone call. After sitting in a chair and lifting the handset of the phone, the lights go out, there is a scream and a sound like a door slamming, and the relative is never seen again. Stan and Ollie return to their bedroom and get into the bed but a bat has flown into their room and is under their covers, which causes them to panic and run downstairs. All of the other relatives have now disappeared and the butler calls Stan and Ollie to take a telephone call in the study. Ollie sits in the chair to take the call. This time, however, the lights stay on and it is revealed that the chair is affixed to a trapdoor into which each of the other relatives vanished.

Article:A study found those slower in tests were more likely to have psychosis, like hearing voices and seeing things that are not present, at the age of 12. Children with psychotic experiences are more at risk of developing psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia as adults. It is hoped the Cardiff and Bristol universities study will help treatment. Some 6,784 children who took part in the study were tested to see how quickly they could process information. Their attention, memory, reasoning, and ability to solve problems were also assessed. Among those interviewed, 787 (11.6%) had had suspected or definite psychotic experiences by the time they were 12 - with children who scored lower in the tests more likely to have had them. This was particularly the case for the test that assessed how quickly the children processed information. Researchers said that the psychotic experiences could often be both distressing and frightening and interfere with children's everyday lives. The study has been published in the American Journal of Psychiatry.. Maria Niarchou, from Cardiff University's School of Medicine, lead author of the study, said: \\"Previous research has shown a link between the slowing down of information processing and schizophrenia and this was found to be at least in part the result of anti-psychotic medication. \\"However, this study shows that impaired information processing speed can already be present in childhood and associated with higher risk of psychotic experiences, irrespective of medication.\\" But her Cardiff colleague Dr Marianne van den Bree said not every child who processed information slowly was at risk of psychosis later in life. \\"Further research is needed to determine whether interventions to improve processing speed in at-risk children can lead to decreased transition to psychotic disorders,\\" she said. Ruth Coombs, of the mental health charity Mind Cymru, said the research could help young people at risk of psychosis to build resilience and to benefit from early help. \\"It is important to remember that people can and do recover from mental health problems and we also welcome further research which supports resilience building in young people,\\" she added.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Trainer’s Steroid Testimony Followed Deal With Prosecutors A proffer is a written agreement between a person and a prosecutor allowing a person to say what they know about possible illegal activity with the assurance it will not be used against them at trial. The government is free to follow investigative leads. The proffer agreement, colloquially known as a “queen for a day” letter, may lead to a written immunity, cooperation or plea bargain agreement, or it may stop there if the government does not plan to take the case further. Daniel C. Richman, a professor at Columbia University Law School and a former federal prosecutor, said it was extraordinary to see prosecutors compel an individual to cooperate with a private third party like Mitchell. Bradley D. Simon, a former assistant United States attorney in New York, agreed, adding that he thought, “It sounds to me like they’re not planning to go further or they wouldn’t have offered them up to the Mitchell commission.” Simon said the government must have concluded the Mitchell commission was a good partner in attacking steroids. Kirk Radomski, a former Mets clubhouse attendant who supplied steroids and human growth hormone to McNamee and dozens of players from 1995 through 2005, became Mitchell’s best source of information. He has signed plea bargain and cooperation agreements. Radomski, who faced up to 25 years in prison, may receive a considerably shorter sentence for drug distribution because of his cooperation. He has already pleaded guilty, and will appear in court Feb. 8. Radomski’s lawyer said Monday that he would have no comment until after sentencing. Bigbie and Allen did not return phone calls for comment. Ward said the proffer agreement required McNamee to cooperate with the government but not Mitchell; that request came later. “Nothing was written, but it was understood he would continue to speak with him, and if he did so, he wouldn’t be charged,” Ward said. McNamee told Mitchell he injected Clemens more than a dozen times with steroids or human growth hormone. Clemens’s lawyer has denied those accusations. McNamee told Mitchell he also injected Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte with human growth hormone two to four times. Pettitte has admitted to using H.G.H. for “two days” while he was recovering from an elbow injury in 2002. Jeff Novitzky, a special agent with the Internal Revenue Service criminal division, and Matthew A. Parrella, an assistant United States attorney working on the five-year-old Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative case, worked with Radomski and McNamee and attended some of their interviews with Mitchell, a person briefed on the case said. The report did not specify which agents or prosecutors attended Bigbie’s and Allen’s interviews. It said they have “been cooperating with federal authorities in connection with their investigation of illegal distribution of performance-enhancing substances.” Bigbie, 30, was an outfielder for Baltimore from 2001 to July 2005, before going to Colorado and St. Louis. Bigbie got caught up in the federal steroids investigation when authorities monitored a call between him and Radomski, according to the Mitchell report. Bigbie told Mitchell investigators that he and Brian Roberts were introduced to Radomski by David Segui; that Roberts, Rafael Palmiero and Jack Cust told him they had used steroids; and that he saw Miguel Tejada inject himself with vitamin B12, the report says. Bigbie offered no documentary evidence. Allen, 32, was an outfielder for Minnesota, Cleveland, Florida and Texas from 1999 through 2005, before playing in Japan. According to the Mitchell report, Allen admitted to using steroids that he bought from Radomski. He also said that he believed Bart Miadich had used steroids based on his physical appearance and demeanor, and that Gary Matthews Jr. might have left unused syringes at his condominium. It remains unclear whether federal investigators learned anything new from the Mitchell report and whether they may still be investigating. John Dowd, a lawyer whose report on behalf of Major League Baseball in 1989 concluded Pete Rose bet on baseball, said his own investigation provided federal authorities with information that led to Rose’s being indicted on federal tax charges. “Our situation was different than Mitchell’s,” Dowd said in a telephone interview Monday. “We were the ones providing the government with information. The U.S. attorney’s office was helpful and would make witnesses available, but we had much of the information.” A sports article on Tuesday about the influence federal investigators had on former Senator George J. Mitchell’s report about performance-enhancing drugs in baseball misstated the given name of a player implicated in the report. He is Jack Cust, not David.

I've been keeping count of how often people sing around the house these days. The fact is, they don't. My earliest memories are of my mother crooning lullabies in a gentle low voice as she rocked each infant in turn. She said she \\"didn't have a singing voice,\\" but her low, wavering alto will always mean comfort to me. Every time I have sat through the night with a feverish body or held a pre - schooler through a nightmare, the melodies returned, words appearing and disappearing like fragments of a dream but held together by the hum of love. Today, young mothers are routinely presented with lullaby tapes at the baby shower. When baby cries, the idea goes, they will be able to switch on the high-tech audio system and _ with the voices of strangers in his ears, perfectly on pitch. If I had my way, new parents would learn the songs themselves, throw out their stereos, and give their child the gift of their own sleepy voices through the midnight hours. These days, when we go on a trip, my daughters take along tiny personal stereos and headphones. They are lost in their private worlds, and I can't help wishing that at least here, in the car my girls would be forced to listen to their mother's voice again, sure I'm out-of-tune songs that they might then pass down to another generation. Those sophisticated earphones have robbed them of something I think every kid should carry from childhood car trips into adulthood. I drove away from that party humming, and all the way home the good old songs kept tumbling out. Damm it , I thought, why did I ever stop singing in the car and start turning on the radio ? Why don't I sing anymore while I'm doing the dishes? I'm going to pull those stereo wires right out of the wall when I get home.

Movie title: Duplex Movie plot: Alex Rose (Ben Stiller) and Nancy Kendricks (Drew Barrymore) are a young, professional, New York couple in search of their dream home. When they finally find the perfect Brooklyn brownstone they are giddy with anticipation. The duplex is a dream come true, complete with multiple fireplaces, except for one thing: Mrs. Connelly (Eileen Essell), the old lady who lives on the rent-controlled top floor. Assuming she is elderly and ill, they take the apartment.However, they soon realize that Mrs. Connelly is in fact an energetic senior who enjoys watching her television at top volume day and night and rehearsing in a brass band. As a writer, Alex is attempting to finish his novel against a looming deadline. However, he is interrupted daily by Mrs. Connelly's numerous demands and requests, and what begins as a nuisance quickly escalates into an all-out war. Alex and Nancy try to get Mrs. Connelly to move out, but she refuses. Next, they try to file a noise complaint against her, but discover that she has already gone to the police first and filed a harassing complaint against them. Mrs. Connelly soon turns all of Alex and Nancy's friends against them by play-acting as the \\"poor, innocent, old lady\\" and makes it appear that the young couple are out to harm her.When Nancy loses her job and Alex misses his deadline (all because of the old lady's antics) the pair are trapped at home together with Mrs. Connelly with no place to go. Their rage turns to homicidal fantasy as they plot ways to get rid of their manipulative, no-good neighbor. After peace overtunes and a break-in lead to nothing, Alex and Nancy decide to hire a hitman, named Chick (James Remar), to kill her. However, his asking price for doing the hit is 25,000.

A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Duplex,\\" it is Mrs. Connelly (Eileen Essell) who fakes her own death. The movie follows the story of Alex Rose (Ben Stiller) and Nancy Kendricks (Drew Barrymore), a couple who move into their dream home, a duplex in Brooklyn. They share the building with Mrs. Connelly, an elderly lady living in a rent-controlled apartment on the top floor. They initially assume she is frail and ill, but soon discover that she is an energetic and disruptive presence in their lives. This leads to a series of conflicts between the couple and Mrs. Connelly, as they struggle to deal with her constant noise and demands. Eventually, Alex and Nancy reach a breaking point and decide to hire a hitman named Chick (James Remar) to get rid of her. In order to pay Chick's 25,000 fee, they sell most of their belongings and arrange for the hit to take place on Christmas Eve. However, things do not go according to plan. Chick breaks into Mrs. Connelly's apartment but is seemingly scared away by the old woman and ends up falling down the stairs, triggering a massive heart attack. Alex and Nancy, now out of options, decide to take matters into their own hands. They break into Mrs. Connelly's apartment with the intention of killing her themselves, only to find her \\"dead\\" in her bed. Thinking their problems are finally over, they begin to relax. It is then revealed that Mrs. Connelly has faked her own death to continue causing chaos in their lives. The situation comes to an explosive climax when a gas-fueled fire breaks out, leaving all three characters to face the consequences of their actions. The movie \\"Duplex\\" is a dark comedy that explores themes of desperation, conflict, and the lengths people will go to protect their own interests. When considering whether or not to invest in this film proposal, factors such as the talented cast, engaging plot, and potential for audience appeal should be weighed. Ultimately, the decision will depend on an individual's personal taste and assessment of the project's potential marketability and profitability."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What is Michele's profession? partisan call-girl Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Michele: The Partisan Call-girl\\" Set in the late 1940s, in the aftermath of World War II, the movie tells the story of Michele, a savvy and resourceful woman who uses her profession as a call-girl to help launch a partisan revolution against a ruthless, militaristic regime that has taken control of her city. Plot: The film opens with Michele at a posh club, where she is engaging in conversation with high-ranking military officials. Using her charm and wit, she manages to gain crucial information about the regime's plans. Illustrating her apparent dual life, she spends her nights as a call-girl servicing these same officials, while secretly plotting with her fellow partisans to counter their oppressive actions. Her double identity helps her build a network of sympathizers from the city, as well as within the regime, who are also against the tyrannical rule. Among her key allies is Raul, a young and idealistic member of the resistance who is eventually captivated by her beauty and intelligence. Raul and Michele develop an intense personal relationship and become co-conspirators in the fight against the government. As Michele continues her work as a call-girl, she successfully extracts valuable information from her clients, such as the location of a hidden military base and future operations. She passes this information on to Raul and the partisans, who use it to stage strategic attacks against the regime. Over time, the impact of Michele's work becomes increasingly apparent, with the regime growing more unstable by the day. As her role within the resistance becomes more dangerous, Michele finds herself being pursued by the relentless Colonel Josef, who suspects her of espionage. Aware of Michele's reputation as a call-girl but without concrete evidence against her, the Colonel tries to find proof of her involvement with the partisan movement. Inevitably, Michele is eventually caught in a comprising position, and as a result, she is arrested by Colonel Josef and his men. Facing brutal interrogation and torture, Michele's strength is tested as she fights to maintain her secrecy and loyalty to Raul and the partisans. Meanwhile, Raul, now the leader of the resistance, learns of Michele's capture and quickly hatches a plan to free her from the enemy's grasp. In a daring rescue mission, Raul and the partisans infiltrate the prison where Michele is being held and succeed in liberating her. With her newfound freedom, she resumes her life as a call-girl in order to continue her work in gathering valuable intelligence for the resistance. The success of the rescue operation elevates the partisans' morale, as the grip of the dictatorship begins to weaken. In a climactic final battle between the partisans and the regime, Michele's invaluable intel leads her people to the heart of the military's stronghold. Just as the regime prepares to unleash its ultimate weapon against the growing resistance, Raul and his army confront the military forces and defeat them, protecting the city and its people from devastation. In the end, Michele's dual life as a partisan call-girl and secret revolutionary comes to an end, as the regime is toppled, and a new era of freedom and peace dawns upon the city. It is revealed that in this new world, Michele trades her secret life for a position in the reformed government to ensure the continued pursuit of justice and equality. The movie closes with Michele and Raul celebrating the victorious outcome and the future they have built together. \\"Michele: The Partisan Call-girl\\" is a compelling tale intertwining espionage, romance, and revolution against the backdrop of a war-torn city. It serves as a testament to the power of resilience, courage, and the indomitable spirit of those who fight for what they believe in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.

Who was known as the Mummy of Birchin Bower? Answer the above question based on the context below: Beswick's mummified body was initially kept at Ancoats Hall, the home of another Beswick family member, but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White's home in Sale, Manchester, where it was stored in an old clock case. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity; the author Thomas de Quincey was one of those who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as \\"one of the most remarkable objects in the museum\\". The \\"cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century\\", according to writer Edith Sitwell.There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick. One of the few contemporary accounts of her is provided by Philip Wentworth, a local historian: The body was well preserved but the face was shrivelled and black. The legs and trunks were tightly bound in a strong cloth such as is used for bed ticks [a stiff kind of mattress cover material] and the body, which was that of a little old woman, was in a glass coffin-shaped case. Shortly after the museum's transfer to Manchester University in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was \\"irrevocably and unmistakably dead\\", the time had come for her to be buried. But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a certificate of death before a burial could take place; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State, who issued an order for her burial. With the permission of the Bishop of Manchester, Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death.

Detectives also have no evidence that Tennen's mouth was stapled during the attack as he claimed. Vicious attack: Zach Tennen, 19, was beaten unconscious and had his jaw broken at a party close to Michigan State University. However police do not believe it was motivated by the fact the student is Jewish. Beaten: College student Zach Tennen (left) said his attackers stapled his mouth when he was unconscious. Police captain Jeff Murphy (right) also disputed this claim. The journalism student, from Franklin in Oakland County, is recovering from jaw surgery. Tennen's father Bruce says the conclusions by East Lansing police 'sicken us'. An 18-year-old man from Farmington Hills is a suspect, although no arrest has been made. East Lansing police did not return further calls from MailOnline today. Earlier this week, Zach Tennen said he was set upon by two men who asked if he was Jewish. The attackers, who claimed to be Ku Klux Klan, then raised their arms in a Nazi salute, saying 'Heil Hitler' and began hitting the teenager. Zach said that while he was passed out, the attackers managed to staple through his gums. He said: 'It was coming up in my two bottom teeth and it started in my gum, so, somehow they managed to staple it.' Vicious assault: Zach Tennen, 19, was recovering at home near Detroit, after he was beaten by two men in an apparent anti-Semitic attack. Violent: Zach indicates where he woke up to find he had a staple in his mouth after being attacked on Sunday. His mother told the Detroit Free Press that around 20 people at the party watched the attack but no one helped her son. He was then thrown out of the party. The teenager also has a broken jaw below his bottom teeth which required being set with wire. His family contacted the Anti-Defamation League, an organization which fights anti-Semitism, on account of the assault. In a statement to MailOnline, ADL Detroit Regional Director Betsy Kellman said: 'We. are horrified by this violent assault and allegations that the student. may have been viciously attacked because he was Jewish. Place of learning: Zach was beaten up close to the East Lansing campus of Michigan State University, pictured. 'We are confident that the East Lansing. Police will thoroughly investigate this deeply troubling case and, given. the allegations, treat it as a possible hate crime. We hope the. perpetrators will be swiftly brought to justice.' Zach, who graduated from Birmingham Groves High School last year and studies journalism at MSU, said he had drank alcohol at the party but only a small amount. After his attackers fled, he called a cab to take him to Lansing Sparrow Hospital. The hospital did not call the police but said that it was standard policy to alert authorities if someone reported being a victim of assault. Zach later had surgery at a Detroit hospital to have his jaw wired shut. Brutal: Zach Tennen said the men who assaulted him asked if he was Jewish and then made Nazi signs. Injuries: The 19-year-old took a cab to Lansing Sparrow Hospital, pictured, after being beaten unconscious. Michigan State's Student Affairs and Services released this statement: 'Michigan State University's Student Affairs and Services office has reached out to the family of the student assaulted in East Lansing to provide the academic and other support the student needs. 'MSU will work with the student and his professors to ensure he can fulfill his academic requirements, as we would with any student in need. 'As the incident occurred off campus in East Lansing, all questions about the police investigation need to go the East Lansing Police Department.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The article, published on August 29, 2012, reports on an assault on a Jewish college student named Zach Tennen. The 19-year-old was attacked at a party close to Michigan State University, suffering a broken jaw and other injuries.

Although an 18-year-old man from Farmington Hills was identified as a suspect, no arrests had been made at the time of the article's publication. Tennen's family expressed their disgust at the situation, and the Anti-Defamation League was contacted to investigate the assault as a possible hate crime.

Harbinder Singh Rana, 52, was jailed in the 1980s for a series of attacks on women, who believed he was a doctor, in which he performed internal examinations and administered injections. Rana served four years for his crimes, but has since reinvented himself as a pillar of the community. Raising questions: Harbinder Singh Rana on board the Spirit of Chartwell during the Queens Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the River Thameswith members of the Royal family. Rana spent the pageant in close proximity to the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge. And in an astonishing error of judgment the Sikh charity director, who now lives in Walsall in the West Midlands, was allowed to mingle with VIPs on the Royal Barge during Sunday’s River Pageant. During the afternoon sail, Rana came into close contact with every senior royal including Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The convicted sex attacker was at times during the 1,000 boat extravaganza just feet from the Queen herself. The former management consultant was invited to join the exclusive celebrations by Prince Charles in his capacity as community leader. He is understood to have met the prince through his charity work for the Anglo-Sikh heritage trail, a group that promotes Sikh culture in Britain. But palace sources last night said the prince was completely unaware of the charity director’s shameful past-and would never have invited him had he known. Approached yesterday Rana said that he did not know if he had been vetted and had not been asked about his sex crimes before the event. Harbinder Singh Rana, director of Maharaja Dalip.

The Prince of Wales unveiling a statue dedicated to the last Indian Maharajah, Duleep Singh on Butten Island in Thetford, in 1999. He told the Mirror: ‘I was given the invitation and I attended. 'The fact that the Prince of Wales invited me clearly shows what I have done for the community since then.’ He added: ‘I have a relationship with some of Charles’s staff, not him – although I have met him at events, yes. ‘I have made it clear I wasn’t representing the Sikh community, I was there because I was very happy to be invited.’ He said that, although the Queen was at times just ‘a few feet' from him, he never spoke to her or any senior member of the Royal Family while on the boat. The revealation will raise questions about why apparently no checks were carried out on Mr Rana's background before he was allowed to be photographed within inches of senior royals. The convicted sex attacker was at times during the 1,000 boat extravaganza just feet from the Queen. The massive error brings into sharp focus the vetting procedures in place to protect the Royal Family. Questions. will now be raised about why apparently no checks were carried out on. his background before he was allowed to be photographed within inches of. senior royals. And an investigation into how such an unsuitable guest sailed through the vetting process will likely soon be under way. A. spokesman for Clarence House confirmed that the prince had not known. about Rana’s convictions. She said: ‘Harbinder Singh was asked to take. part in the pageant as he is a leading member of the Sikh community and. someone who has done a lot of charitable work. ‘Guests. of the Pageant including representatives from all major faith. communities, spread across a number of key vessels – as with the Royal. Family, who were present on a number of vessels.’ Last night the Metropolitan Police confirmed that those travelling on the royal barge would have been security vetted. But it is thought security chiefs did not deem him a threat to the Royals. A Met spokesman said: ‘The purpose of a security check is to assess the threat to members of the Royal Family and other protected persons.’ At his trial Rana protested his innocence and yesterday continued to say it was a case of ‘mistaken identity’. Speaking of his conviction he told the Mirror: ‘It was very circumstantial It is an area I have switched off from my life and got on with it.’ Rana’s previous convictions have caused controversy in the past. In 2002, the Sikh Secretariat, a campaigning group, said it was ‘appalled’ at Rana’s role as a Government adviser. Mr Rana represented Sikhs on the Inner Cities Religious Council, a group that advised the Government on local issues. Speaking about his place in the body, the Sikh Secretariat said: ‘We are aware that Government officials and junior ministers have known about the situation, but have taken no action. Out of a choice of 700,000 Sikhs we cannot understand why someone like this was elected to represent our views.’ Mr Rana defended his place on the body, saying: ‘I have never tried to hide my convictions, even though the evidence presented was contentious. Are they saying rehabilitation and forgiveness should not exist? What I should be judged on is the work I’ve done in the Sikh community since that date.’ Mr Singh Rana was found guilty of five counts of indecent assault, 11 counts of assault causing actual bodily harm and one count of attempted assault in August 1986.

I had a stress heart attack five years ago. My step-son is a heroin addict. He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son’s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth. So, yep, I had a heart attack. I’m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I’m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse. I found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors. Since then I find I’m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband. I honestly think if it had been one of my children doing the abusing, I would have found a way to put my child into long-term rehab.

Given the question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Bad and the Beautiful Movie plot: In Hollywood, director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan), movie star Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner), and screenwriter James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) each refuse to speak by phone to Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) in Paris. Movie producer Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon) gathers them in his office and explains that Shields was calling them because he has a new film idea and he wants the three of them for the project. Shields cannot get financing on his own, but with their names attached, there would be no problem. Pebbel asks the three to allow him to get Shields on the phone before they give their final answer. As they await Shields' call, Pebbel assures the three that he understands why they refused to speak to Shields. The backstory of their involvement with Shields then unfolds in a series of flashbacks. Shields is the son of a notorious former studio head who had been dumped by the industry. The elder Shields was so unpopular that his son had to hire \\"extras\\" to attend his funeral. Despite the industry's ill feelings toward him because of his father, the younger Shields is determined to make it in Hollywood by any means necessary. Shields partners with aspiring director Amiel, whom he meets at his father's funeral. Shields intentionally loses money he does not have in a poker game to film executive Pebbel, so he can talk Pebbel into letting him work off the debt as a line producer. Shields and Amiel learn their respective trades making B movies for Pebbel. When one of their films becomes a hit, Amiel decides they are ready to take on a more significant project he has been nursing along, and Shields pitches it to the studio. Shields gets a 1 million budget to produce the film, but betrays Amiel by allowing someone with an established reputation to be chosen as director. The film's success allows Shields to start his own studio, and Pebbel comes to work for him there. Amiel, now independent of Shields, goes on to become an Oscar-winning director in his own right. Shields next encounters alcoholic small-time... My question: Where did Shields meet Amiel? The answer is:","completion":"Shields met Amiel at his father's funeral."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the sentiment of the following review? So I'm not gonna lie, I was COMPLETELY disappointed with the Encore. My BF and I have stayed at the Wynn twice before and absolutely loved it. Since we had stayed in the past we both have our Red Cards and receive the promotions that come with it in the mail every so often. The last promotion we received was for the Encore and was for 109/night King Suites with 50 resort credit for staying two nights or more. With my BF and two friends birthdays coming up in the month of September the four of us decided to get two suites and celebrate. For months I bragged to our friends about how amazing the Wynn was and that I bet the Encore will be even better. We waited anxiously during the long month between our booking and the actual trip. We get there and are greeted by a beautiful lobby, over the top and so out there it's almost tacky, but it blends together as posh and classy. We are greeted immediately by someone who tells us to please stand in a specific line, though I can't remember what line that was (it was a special line). We waited for quite some time when another person came over and said she could help us right away at another computer. So we provide the lady our info, she pulls up the reservation, 2 suites with one couple in each suite, she offers us the upgrade to the 56th floor for an additional 20-25 (which was odd because the last two trips to Wynn had upgrades on the house). So we take the upgrade, sign permission for the additional upgrade charge and go to our suites. The suites are beautiful. Love that the TV turns completely around so you can watch it in either the living space or the bed, comfy chase lounge, great detail throughout and, like the Wynn, a gorgeous bathroom. We had a room facing the strip south (beautiful) and our friends had a room facing the strip north and downtown. It started out wonderfully. So we put our orders in for in-room breakfast the next morning, down a couple drinks, and head for the buffet. We have been to the buffet numerous times, and it is our favorite on the strip. We made our friends fans as well. The trip goes to plan, loved the pool, loved the casino, in-room breakfast is always a treat. So here comes check out. We go down stairs and the line is insane. We're talking at least a 45 minute wait. So a gentleman comes by and asks if we would like to give him our room number and an email address and they will send our bill to us right away. I made it a point to ask him should there be discrepancies if we could call back for them to be resolved. He said of course, no problem. So 4 days later (which in Wynn language means \\"right away\\") we receive our bill. For 448 more than our original reservation. So I call billing immediately. They only work 8-3 Monday through Friday, which the receptionist called bankers hours. I want to work at that bank! So the next day I call billing and the girl proceeds to tell me that I signed for the additional 100 a night (which came to 400 all together, plus 48 for their 12% tax) in addition to the room up-sell and that in doing that I had agreed to paying 209 a night instead of 109. I nearly lost it. Her and I went round and round and finally she says, \\"Oh I see the problem, it's because additional people were staying in the room\\". There were two people in each room. I asked her \\"Do you really believe I'm going to take a vacation by myself and leave my partner at home?! The average person vacations with their other half.\\" She keeps repeating to me that this was the reason and that I had agreed to it at check in. I finally asked to speak to a supervisor who immediately knew what the problem was. See, when I made the reservation I asked for 2 rooms for 4 people. The computer supposedly took this as 2 rooms with 4 people in each. She admitted they were wrong and promised me it would be taken care of and I should see the new correct bill in a couple days. Now 10 days later, with no new bill and no activity on my credit card I call back the billing department. I speak to some guy who says he sees the notes in my portfolio to correct the bill, but that no action has been taken on it. I nearly lost it again. I began asking him questions and you could tell through his phone demeanor he was getting irritated that I wouldn't just let him get off the phone and get back to the laughing I could hear in the background. He finally says he'll have to look through the bills to see what he can do and he will get back to me this evening or tomorrow. No call tonight, have a feeling I won't get one tomorrow. I love the Wynn, I really do, but I'm sad to say this may have been my last trip there. They lost an incredibly loyal fan. I hope no one else has to go through the mismanagement of this resort like we did.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with their experience at the Encore, especially when compared to their previous stays at the Wynn. While they mention some positive points (beautiful lobby, great suite details, enjoyable pool, casino, and buffet), the main focus of their dissatisfaction is on miscommunication, billing issues, and poor customer service. They report being overcharged and struggling to get the issue resolved, ultimately saying that the Wynn lost an incredibly loyal fan. The reviewer's frustration is evident throughout and they share their experience as a warning to others who might face similar challenges at the resort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The language in the review, such as \\"piece of you know what,\\" \\"personal opinion and sub-cultural trash,\\" and \\"Gimme a break,\\" further supports that the reviewer had a negative experience with the product. The reviewer also mentions agreeing with the last review, which implies there's at least one more negative review for the product.

Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television.

The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Milly's plan? The answer to this question is:","completion":"It is more likely that the number of animals will increase under Milly's plan. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. This position aligns more closely with the environmentalist stance. The reasoning behind this is based on understanding the effects of these gases on global warming and climate change. Excess carbon dioxide and other gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, often referred to as greenhouse gases, contribute to the warming of our planet. This is known as the greenhouse effect. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, some is absorbed by the Earth and some is reflected back into space. However, these gases trap some of the reflected heat, causing the Earth's temperature to rise, a phenomenon known as global warming. The continued rise of Earth's temperature leads to severe weather changes, rising sea levels, and detrimentally affects ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity loss. The effects are particularly harmful to animals. Changes in temperature and weather patterns can disrupt the delicately balanced ecosystems that animals depend on for survival. For instance, increased temperatures can result in habitats that are too hot for certain species, causing them to migrate or face extinction. Additionally, climate change can disrupt food chains. For certain animals, if the species they prey on decreases in number or migrates due to changes in climate, it can lead to starvation and population decline. Also, the rise in sea levels can lead to loss of habitat, particularly for coastal and marine animals. Therefore, by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, Milly's plan could help curb global warming and climate change, thus preserving animal habitats and potentially leading to an increase in the number of animals. It's important to note, however, that the relationship between these gases and the survival of animals is much more complex, involving other factors such as the abilities of different species to adapt to changes, the efficacy of the measures used to reduce these gases, among others. But generally, Milly's plan is more beneficial to the survival of animals compared to the proposition of increasing anthropogenic gases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This historic performance took place at the Hershey Sports Arena in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Wilt Chamberlain, a 7-foot-1-inch center, had an extraordinary career in the NBA, dominating the sport during the 1960s and early 1970s. Known as one of the game's greatest scorers and rebounders, Chamberlain played for the Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the Los Angeles Lakers. On that legendary night, Chamberlain was unstoppable. He scored 36 field goals and made 28 free throws out of 32 attempted, both records at the time. To put his achievement into perspective, no other player has come particularly close to the 100-point mark since then. The closest anyone has gotten in the modern era is Kobe Bryant, who scored 81 points for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Toronto Raptors on January 22, 2006. Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game is considered one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of professional basketball. It was a testament to his skill, determination, and dominance in the game.

When Starr married Maureen Cox in 1965, Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man, with Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses. Soon afterwards, the couple's matrimony became the subject of a US novelty song, \\"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\\", by the Chicklettes. Starr and Maureen had three children together: Zak (born 13 September 1965), Jason (born 19 August 1967) and Lee (born 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's former home, Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there. Following Starr's repeated infidelities, the couple divorced in 1975. Maureen died from leukaemia at age 48 in 1994. In 1980, while on the set of the film Caveman, Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with The Who's Keith Moon. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. In total, Ringo Starr has eight grandchildren - one from Zak, four from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather. Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh, Surrey; Los Angeles; and Monte Carlo. In the Sunday Times Rich List 2011, Starr was listed at number 56 in the UK with an estimated personal wealth of PS150 million. In 2012, Starr was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014 Starr announced that his 200-acre Surrey estate at Rydinghurst, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house, was for sale. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles.

What was the planned, first devised by Raivis Zeltits, to form a federation of Central and Eastern European countries after World War I?","completion":"The plan devised by Raivis Zeltits, a Latvian politician and an influential theorist, to form a federation of Central and Eastern European countries after World War I was known as the \\"Intermarium\\" plan. The main objective behind this concept was to create a buffer zone and a strong alliance to contain the rising powers of Bolshevik Russia in the East and Germany in the West to maintain peace and balance in the region after the devastating war. The Intermarium plan was originally founded on the geopolitical vision of Józef Piłsudski, a prominent Polish statesman who sought to revive the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as a federation of Central and Eastern European countries. Zeltits, heavily influenced by Piłsudski's idea of the Intermarium, aimed to incorporate the Baltic States, Poland, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and possibly Hungary, Finland, and Bulgaria into a single federation. The key principles behind the Intermarium plan were: 1. Unity and cooperation amongst the nations of Central and Eastern Europe to form a collective defense and a diplomatic front against potential threats from Bolshevism and potential German expansionism. 2. Formation of a geopolitical counterweight by neutralizing Germany and Russia's influence over the region and ensuring the sovereignty and independence of these countries. 3. Establishment of a democratic, federal system of governance which incorporated cultural, economic, military, and political cooperation amongst the federated states to ensure their stability and mutual development. 4. Promotion of intercultural understanding and harmonious relationships within the Intermarium region based on shared ideals of liberty, democracy, and self-determination. 5. Forming a strong economic bloc that would stimulate regional trade, economic growth, and technological advancements amongst the Intermarium nations, thereby reducing their dependency on external economies. However, the Intermarium plan faced several critical challenges: 1. Complex historical, political, and ethnic differences created divisions among the Central and Eastern European nations, making it difficult for them to come to a mutual consensus and cooperate. 2. Ambitious nationalistic aspirations and territorial disputes amongst the potential member states often hindered progress with respect to the concept of the Intermarium. 3. Resistance from both Germany and Russia, which recognized the Intermarium as a potential threat to their respective regional dominance and control. 4. The lack of overall consensus and support from major global powers like the United States, United Kingdom, and France. Despite Zeltits' and other proponents' efforts, the Intermarium plan ultimately failed to materialize due to a combination of internal conflicts amongst the prospective member states and external pressures from more powerful neighboring countries, specifically Germany and the Soviet Union. The nations within this region either pursued alliances with other powers or were coerced into the Soviet sphere of influence, leading to the formation of the Eastern Bloc after World War II. It wasn't until the end of the Cold War and subsequent accession of many Central and Eastern European countries to NATO and the European Union that regional cooperation and integration could be fully realized."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it still conveys a meaningful idea, and under certain contexts, it can be seen as a legitimate expression. I will provide, in depth, the linguistic analysis to support this conclusion. First, let's break down the grammatical components of this sentence: Subject: I Verb: separated Direct Object: the milk Prepositional phrase: of the cream The sentence structure is clear: Subject-Verb-Direct Object-Prepositional Phrase. This structure in itself is valid in English. The main issue lies in the semantics and the prepositional phrase \\"of the cream.\\" We generally expect the preposition \\"from\\" to be used for separation, as in \\"I separated the cream from the milk,\\" conveying the idea that the milk and the cream were objects originally combined, and the speaker took action to isolate one from the other. Using \\"of the cream\\" instead of \\"from the cream\\" may lead native English speakers to interpret it as if you are trying to say that cream is a unique part of the milk, or a quality that comes from milk, as in \\"I separated the essence of the cream.\\" However, this meaning isn't well-established since \\"cream\\" and \\"milk\\" are physically separate entities. Yet, it is not a completely nonsensical idea either. From a generous perspective, especially when context is considered, a linguist might assume that \\"I separated the milk of the cream\\" is a slight mistake, or a less common, nonstandard way to convey that the speaker is trying to separate the cream from the milk. In a casual conversation, there is a good chance listeners will understand the intended meaning, even though the phrasing is awkward or non-idiomatic. To summarize, while the given sentence does not follow the standard grammatical expectations for the prepositional phrase, it could still be interpreted as a meaningful sentence that conveys the idea of separating the cream from the milk. A linguist might recognize that the sentence does not adhere to the grammatical norms, but would still acknowledge that it transmits an intelligible idea. In a conversation, it might be deemed a less common, nonstandard variant of the more accepted phrasing, \\"I separated the cream from the milk.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Every profession or trade, every art, and every science has its technical vocabulary, the function of which is partly to refer to things or processes which have no names in ordinary English, and partly to secure greater exactness in expression. Such special dialects, or jargon, are necessary in technical discussion of any kind. Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular science or art, they have the precision of a mathematical formula . Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole, _ Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts. So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom, and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn.

Complete the next sentence: How to repair holes in drywall Get a ready-made drywall patch. These are available at big-box home centers and hardware stores. They use a peel-and-stick, metal-backed patch for added strength.","completion":"First, determine the size and type of hole you are dealing with. Small holes, typically those smaller than 1/2 inch in diameter, can be easily repaired with a pre-made patch. For medium-sized holes, ranging from 1/2 inch to 5 inches in diameter, you may require a special type of patch called a \\"California patch\\". Larger holes, greater than 5 inches in diameter, may need reinforcement with wood and a new piece of drywall. Next, gather the necessary tools and materials for the repair, which may include: a drywall patch (either pre-made for small holes or cut to size for larger holes), joint compound, a putty knife, a utility knife, sandpaper, a drywall saw, measuring tape, a pencil, a small piece of wood (for large holes), a cordless drill or screwdriver, and drywall screws. Now, follow these step-by-step instructions for repairing the hole: 1. Clean the hole: Before beginning any repair, clean the hole and surrounding area by removing any debris, paint, or wallpaper. Simply use the utility knife to trim away any jagged or rough edges to create a clean, smooth hole. 2. Apply the patch: For small holes, peel the backing off the pre-made patch and stick it directly over the hole, ensuring the patch is fully adherent to the surrounding wall. For medium and large holes, follow the next steps. 3. Cut a \\"California patch\\": If you are dealing with a medium-sized hole, measure the dimensions of the hole and cut a piece of drywall slightly larger than the hole, usually about 1-2 inches greater in width and height. Next, use your utility knife to cut a 1-inch border around the back side of the patch, leaving only the front paper layer intact. This will create a paper flap around the patch, which will be used to adhere it to the wall when installed. 4. Install the patch: Insert the \\"California patch\\" into the hole, ensuring the paper flap lays flat against the surrounding drywall. Use a putty knife to smooth the edges of the paper flap, making sure it is evenly integrated with the wall. 5. Reinforce large holes: If you are working with a large hole, cut a piece of wood slightly longer than the diameter of the hole to use as a support. Insert the wood into the hole and secure it with drywall screws drilled into the existing drywall on either side of the hole. This will create a stable surface to support your drywall patch. Cut a piece of drywall to fit the hole, and use drywall screws to affix the patch to the wood support. 6. Apply joint compound: Regardless of the size of the hole, you will need to apply joint compound over the patched area. Use a putty knife to spread a thin layer of joint compound over the patch and paper seam, feathering the compound outwards to create a smooth transition between the patch and the surrounding wall. 7. Allow to dry: Allow the joint compound to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions, which typically takes 24 hours or until the compound is no longer wet or tacky to the touch. 8. Sand and finish: Once the joint compound is dry, lightly sand the area using fine-grit sandpaper to remove any imperfections and create a smooth, even surface. Be careful not to sand away the underlying paper, which can weaken the patch. 9. Prime and paint: After sanding, apply a coat of primer to the patched area, allowing it to dry before applying a matching paint color. Depending on the texture of your wall, you may need to use additional techniques such as stippling or roller application to blend the repaired area with the surrounding wall. With patience and attention to detail, the final result should be a seamless repair that would make it difficult for anyone to tell that there was ever any damage to the wall."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What group of people were the most abundant in Brazil in 1872? White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians. The answer is:","completion":"The most abundant group of people in Brazil in 1872 were the browns, making up 38.3% of the population."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The pen was a little \\"tight\\" when switching between black/red/pencil for the first couple of days, but quicky loosened up for more effortless twists. All writing points are very solid when extended, unlike some multi functions which have a good bit of wobble when in use. Overall, the pen feels as if it's constructed very well with quality parts. The satin coating seems very tough, and has some texture to negate slippage when writing. The pocket clip seems very well constructed and durable as well. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"This product review conveys a positive sentiment. The reviewer expresses their satisfaction with the Satin Blue Tech 3 pen in various aspects, including its performance, the construction quality, and its durability. The review starts by mentioning that the reviewer is \\"very pleased\\" with the pen, giving a clear indication of their positive experience. It then discusses how the pen required a brief \\"breaking-in\\" period, where it was initially tight when switching between its different functions but quickly loosened up for more comfortable use.

Additionally, the reviewer commends the pen's \\"solid\\" construction when using its multiple functions, as there is no wobble. They appreciate the pen's overall build quality and construction, attributing it to the use of quality parts. The mention of the satin coating's toughness and textured surface preventing slippage further emphasizes the pen's well-thought design and contributes to the positive sentiment.

Honestly, it's more like 3 stars, but it's close to my house & the pizza is solid enough so 4 stars it is. When this place opened my family used to order pizza from here quite a bit, and always thought it was good. I think at the time this was really the only non-chain pizza place in the area (there's more now). Every now & then we would order other stuff, and honestly, I don't remember it being all that great. The sandwiches were always a little soggy & I remember them putting a ton of sauce on the pasta dishes (the sauce itself wasn't bad, but I don't care how good sauce is, I don't want my pasta drowning in it). I'm glad to see Rome's is still here. It was never crowded when I used to go before (I'm talking over five years ago) & now that I've gone back a few times it still isn't crowded. A few other pizza places have opened close by in the past couple years (which is part of the reason I hadn't been here in so long), but Rome's is still pretty good. The prices are pretty reasonable, which is a big reason I started coming back. They have a deal for two large one-topping pizzas for twenty bucks. The pizza isn't the best I've ever had, but it beats Pizza Hut. They put a lot of toppings on the pizza & the sauce is good. I haven't tried anything else besides the pizza since coming back, but like I said, I don't remember anything but the pizza being all that good in the past, so I think that's all I'll stick to. This might not sound like a glowing 4-star review, but reasonably priced, pretty good pizza (that's close by to my house, no less) makes me a fan. Even though I've always gotten take out, the dining area is pretty big and clean. Maybe somebody I'll actually dine-in. Choose from: A. negative. B. positive.","completion":"B. positive. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The reviewer mentions that the pizza place gets 4 stars. This indicates a positive sentiment. 2. The reviewer states that the pizza is \\"solid enough\\" and also that they are a \\"fan\\" of the place because of its reasonable pricing and proximity to their home. 3. They mention that the pizza is better than Pizza Hut and has a good amount of toppings and sauce. 4. Some negative points are mentioned, such as the sandwiches being soggy and pasta dishes being overly saucy. However, the overall review is still focused on the pizza, which is described positively. 5. Finally, the reviewer mentions the clean dining area as another positive aspect. Although they haven't dined-in, this comment reinforces the positive sentiment of the review. Despite some negative aspects mentioned, the overall sentiment of the review is positive as the primary focus (pizza) receives a favorable evaluation, and the reviewer continues to patronize the establishment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He played the position of linebacker and defensive end. Victor DeGrate played college football at Oklahoma State University. His successful career there paved the way for his further athletic achievements. Oklahoma State University, commonly known as OSU, is a public research university located in a city called Stillwater, in north-central Oklahoma. Because DeGrate played for Oklahoma State University, the home games of the college football team that he played for were conducted in Stillwater. The specific venue for these games is the Boone Pickens Stadium. Boone Pickens Stadium is the home stadium for the Oklahoma State Cowboys football team, of which DeGrate was a part. The Boone Pickens Stadium is named after an oil tycoon and philanthropist T. Boone Pickens, who was an alumnus of the university and a key benefactor. The stadium, with its vibrant atmosphere and the ability to hold approximately 60,000 spectators, gives OSU a robust home-field advantage and attracts football fans from all around the state and beyond. Stillwater is an iconic college town, with a rich history and strong ties to OSU. It embodies the quintessential spirit of collegiate America and is welcoming to students, faculty, and visitors alike. The city's connection with OSU makes it a hub for college sports, especially football. In conclusion, Victor DeGrate, who played football for Oklahoma State University, would have played his home games in Boone Pickens Stadium located in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"yeah that that's where you just float down the river right\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"You just float down the river on tubes, right?\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"yeah that that's where you just float down the river right\\", we can analyze its context, structure, and possible interpretations to determine whether the hypothesis \\"You just float down the river on tubes, right?\\" holds true. First, let's break down the premise: 1. The repetition of the word \\"that\\" suggests informal speech or a conversational style. It could also be a typographical error; however, since there is no additional information to ascertain the exact context, we'll assume the speaker is using casual language. 2. The reference to \\"where\\" implies the existence of a particular location or activity. 3. The phrase \\"you just float down the river\\" suggests an activity where people allow themselves to be carried by the water's natural flow, seemingly implying some kind of leisure or recreational activity. 4. The word \\"right\\" at the end of the sentence functions as a tag question, seeking affirmation or confirmation. Now, let's examine the hypothesis \\"You just float down the river on tubes, right?\\" The hypothesis specifically introduces the concept of \\"tubes\\" as a means for floating down the river. Although the idea of using tubes is consistent with the premise's description of a recreational activity involving floating in a river, this detail is not explicitly mentioned in the premise itself. However, it is a reasonable assumption and a common way to partake in such a pastime. Considering the context, style, wording, and level of detail in the premise, we can surmise that the hypothesis \\"You just float down the river on tubes, right?\\" is likely true. While the addition of \\"tubes\\" introduces a minor assumption that was not explicitly stated in the premise, it follows logically and adheres to the overall theme and meaning of the initial statement. In conclusion, it is fair to say that the hypothesis aligns well with the premise, and we can reasonably conclude that \\"You just float down the river on tubes, right?\\" is true, albeit with a small assumption made about the method of floating."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The sentence selected from this story for analysis is \\"He decided it would be a good idea to get tickets to a hockey game.\\" Guidelines: We need to examine the events in the story that occur before the selected sentence and decide if they indeed cause or merely enable the action described in our selected sentence.

So, we can construe that Dave wanting to spend time with his family causes him to decide to purchase hockey tickets. So using the required format, the answer would be: \\"Dave wanted to spend some time with some family >causes> He decided it would be a good idea to get tickets to a hockey game.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ride are a British rock band that formed in 1988 in Oxford, England, consisting of Andy Bell, Mark Gardener, Laurence \\"Loz\\" Colbert, and Steve Queralt. The band were initially part of the \\"shoegazing\\" scene that emerged in England during the early 1990s. Following the break-up of the band in 1996, members moved on to various other projects, most notably Bell who became the bassist for Oasis. In 2001, the band briefly reunited for a one-off performance for a television show. 1995 saw the dissolution of the band while recording Tarantula. Gardener and Bell had led the band away from their shoegazing roots to become more contemporary, hoping to change their style with the times. Queralt has remarked that the band had two future directions open to them, and they chose the wrong option. Gardener had become interested in dance music, and wanted Ride to incorporate that into their style, while Bell disagreed. The track listing of Carnival of Light gives an indication of the tension that was mounting between the two guitarists, with the first half of the album being songs written by Mark Gardener and the last half of the album being songs written by Andy Bell - Andy Bell had refused to let his songs be interspersed with pieces written by Gardener. Years later Andy Bell explained \\"Imagine an argument where the way you win, is by saying 'I don't want my songs on the same side of the album as yours' and it ACTUALLY HAPPENS. We were allowed by the people around us to behave like total babies.\\" By the time Tarantula appeared, the band was beginning to self-destruct. Bell penned most of the songs while Gardener provided only one - the tension within the band leading to an inability to write meaningful musical pieces. Castle on the Hill, written by Bell, was a lament for the band's situation and contains references to Gardener's self-imposed exile from the group. Gardener walked out during the album's mixing sessions, and the band announced their break-up shortly before its release in March 1996. The album was released and remained on sale for one week before being withdrawn. Critics and fans alike had panned the album (although the first single off the album, \\"Black Nite Crash\\", was awarded \\"single of the week\\" by weekly music magazine Melody Maker). The album was described by AllMusic as \\"an abomination of '70s/Lenny Kravitz cliches, full of third- and fourth-rate tunes and, ultimately, bad blood\\", going on to say \\"the words are just plain awful throughout, not even worth printing\\". Rolling Stone were more complimentary, stating \\"the album is saved from maudlin self-obsession because it's rawer and rocks harder than anything else Ride have recorded\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question. What is a sphygmomanometer used to measure?","completion":"A sphygmomanometer is a medical instrument used to measure blood pressure, specifically the arterial pressure in the circulatory system. Blood pressure measurements are essential for determining an individual's overall cardiovascular health, diagnosing medical conditions like hypertension or hypotension, and for monitoring the effectiveness of treatments such as medications or lifestyle changes. The sphygmomanometer consists of an inflatable cuff connected to a pressure measuring gauge. The cuff is wrapped around the upper arm, on the same level as the heart, and inflated until it temporarily stops the blood flow in the brachial artery. As the cuff deflates, the gauge measures the pressure when a particular sound called the Korotkoff sound first starts, which corresponds to the systolic pressure, and when it disappears, which corresponds to the diastolic pressure. There are two main types of sphygmomanometers, each with different mechanisms for pressure measurement: 1. Aneroid sphygmomanometer: An aneroid sphygmomanometer measures blood pressure using a mechanical gauge with a needle that moves to indicate the pressure. Health professionals manually inflate the cuff with a rubber inflation bulb and listen to the Korotkoff sounds using a stethoscope to determine the systolic and diastolic pressures. This type of sphygmomanometer requires regular calibration to ensure its accuracy. 2. Digital sphygmomanometer: A digital sphygmomanometer uses electronic sensors to measure blood pressure. The cuff is either manually or automatically inflated and deflated, and the device records the pressure readings. Some digital sphygmomanometers also have built-in sensors that listen for the Korotkoff sounds to determine systolic and diastolic pressures, while others rely on oscillometric technology, which detects the fluctuations in pressure through the changes in the cuff's pressure. These devices have the advantage of being easier to use for individuals who wish to measure their blood pressure at home, and also avoid potential human errors due to a health professional's subjective interpretation of the Korotkoff sounds. However, they require batteries to function and can be affected by electromagnetic interference. To maintain accuracy and reliability, it is essential to choose an appropriate cuff size, as a cuff too small or too large may result in inaccurate measurements. Additionally, the individual being tested should be at rest, preferably seated, with their arm supported at heart level. In conclusion, a sphygmomanometer is an essential medical tool used to measure blood pressure and monitor an individual's cardiovascular health. With both aneroid and digital varieties available, healthcare professionals and individuals can obtain vital measurements to diagnose and treat hypertension, hypotension, or other conditions related to blood pressure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cindy Hyde-Smith attended and graduated from a segregation academy that was set up so that white parents could avoid having to send their children to schools with black students, a yearbook reveals. A group photo in the 1975 edition of The Rebel—the Lawrence County Academy Yearbook—illustrates the point. High-school cheerleaders smile at the camera as they lie on the ground in front of their pom-poms, fists supporting their heads. In the center, the mascot, dressed in what appears to be an outfit designed to mimic that of a Confederate general, offers a salute as she holds up a large Confederate flag. Third from the right on the ground is a sophomore girl with short hair, identified in the caption as Cindy Hyde. The photo, and the recently appointed Republican senator’s attendance at one of the many private schools that was set up to bypass integration, adds historic context to comments she made in recent weeks about a “public hanging” that drew condemnations from across the political spectrum. ‘No Doubt That’s Why Those Schools Were Set Up’ Lawrence County Academy opened in the small town of Monticello, Miss., about 60 miles south of Jackson, in 1970. That same year, another segregation school, Brookhaven Academy, opened in nearby Lincoln County. Years later, Hyde-Smith would send her daughter, Anna-Michael, to that academy. Hyde-Smith graduated from Lawrence County Academy in 1977, meaning she would have already been in school elsewhere at the time the academy opened. Although the U.S. Supreme Court ordered public schools to desegregate in 1954 and again in 1955 to do so with “all deliberate speed,” Mississippi slow-walked the integration of its schools as long as possible, trying a variety of “school choice” schemes, state legislation and court cases to stop full integration, including arguing that white kids should not go to school with so-called \\"genetically inferior\\" black students. Fifteen years after school integration become the law of the land, the Supreme Court ordered the immediate desegregation of public schools in 1969, and Mississippi Gov. John Bell Williams ordered that public schools integrate when students returned from Christmas break in early 1970. “So let us accept the inevitable that we are going to suffer one way or the other, both white and black, as a result of the court's decree,” he said at the time. It is no coincidence that the academy Hyde-Smith attended opened the very year after the highest court’s ultimatum, as did others around the state. The day he announced his compliance, Williams made it a priority to focus on private schools as an alternative for white students whose parents were not keen on their children sharing classrooms with black children. The Legislature even approved private-school vouchers for white families to offset the costs of sending their kids to whites-only private schools. “Lawrence County Academy started because people didn’t want their kids going to school with minorities,” Lawrence County NAACP President Wesley Bridges, who also serves on the local public school board, told the Jackson Free Press on Saturday. “That’s been evident.” “Cindy Hyde-Smith was a product of that school,” he added. Rep. Shows: 'I'd Do Anything for Her' There’s “no doubt that’s why those schools were set up,” said former U.S. Rep Ronnie Shows, a Democrat who was Hyde’s junior high basketball coach at Lawrence County Academy in the 1970s. He served as the representative for Mississippi’s fourth congressional district from 1999 to 2003. “She was always a great person back in those days,” Shows told the Jackson Free Press Friday. “I called Cindy and talked to her about this campaign, and I told her I loved her, and I’d do anything for her.” He will not be supporting the senator’s bid for election Tuesday, though. When a video surfaced on Nov. 11 of Hyde-Smith saying she would “be on the front row” if a constituent asked her to go to “a public hanging,” it was just another black eye for perceptions of the state, he said today. If her Democratic opponent, Mike Espy, is not elected, Shows said, “it just reinforces” the worst stereotypes about the state. Espy, a former congressman who served as U.S. secretary of agriculture from 1993 to 1994 under President Bill Clinton, would be the first black U.S. senator from Mississippi since the post-Civil War Reconstruction era. “I told her, ‘There’s nothing I couldn’t do for you, but I can’t do this for you,’” Shows said he told Hyde-Smith about voting for her. Hyde-Smith’s ‘Public Hanging’ Quip Bombs in State with Most Lynchings Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith created a firestorm with her remark about \\"public hangings\\" as she faces off against black opponent Mike Espy. After Lamar White, an independent journalist who writes the Bayou Brief, published the “public hanging” video, people all across the state, including many African American leaders, pointed to the state’s history of lynchings that targeted African Americans. Mississippi was the worst perpetrator of racially motivated lynchings of any state in the South. Hyde-Smith’s campaign responded by saying the “public hanging” remark was just an “expression of regard” for a supporter and called the concerns “ridiculous.” ‘It Was All About the White Guy, Right?’ Many Mississippians scratched their heads. It seemed no one had ever heard the alleged colloquialism, “If he invited me to a public hanging, I’d be on the front row.” The New York Times, though, interviewed a southern linguist who said the expression was used in the late 1800s and early 1900s—when lynchings were most common—but had mostly died out by 1950. Hyde-Smith was born in 1959. Shows, however, said he recalled hearing the expression growing up. “I heard it in passing, not as a joke,” he said. “Coming up back then, I didn’t know the impact until I got older and started reading to find out, and I was shocked. You’ve got to remember that we didn’t study black history then—it was all about the white guy, right? I’m not making excuses. It’s crazy running for office in Mississippi to say that.” Hyde-Smith refused to comment on the video for over a week, but finally offered a pre-written milquetoast apology at the Nov. 20 debate with Espy, only to cast the blame on him and accuse him of twisting her words for “nothing but personal and political gain.” In fact, Espy and his campaign first learned of the video when the Jackson Free Press called them for a comment shortly after it surfaced. Shows attributed Hyde-Smith's refusal to offer a proper apology to her “following Trump”—the president whom she’s clung to throughout the campaign and whom she reminds voters she has voted with “100 percent of the time.” “Have you ever heard Trump back off something?” Shows said. Even though Shows has endorsed her opponent and thinks her victory would be a stain on the state, he does not think of the woman he once coached as a bigot. “I don’t think she’s a racist,” Shows said. “I just think she’s got a lot of constituents who are racist. You know we have them.” She ‘Should Not Get a Pass’ The yearbook, provided to the Jackson Free Press by a former student who asked not to be named, is one of very few pieces of evidence still available that identify the segregation academy as the recently appointed senator’s alma mater. While Hyde-Smith regularly touts her subsequent education at Copiah-Lincoln Community College and the University of Southern Mississippi, her high school has been conspicuously absent from the senator’s official statements, speeches and public biographies. Even her Facebook account suggests her education began with community college. In that reticence about her high-school years, Hyde-Smith is like the man who appointed her to the U.S. Senate seat, Gov. Phil Bryant, who attended one of the Citizens Council academies set up around Jackson by the virulently racist organization for white families fleeing newly integrated schools. Local newspapers treated announcements from those schools about sports and other honors the same as public schools, while running photos of children with a “Citizens Council: States Rights, Racial Integrity” placard in front of them. Bryant also does not publicize that he attended Council McCluer School in south Jackson, which a local historian confirmed through yearbooks for a column in the Jackson Free Press last year. Former Mississippi Democratic Party Chairman Rickey Cole, who knew Hyde-Smith when she was a Democratic state senator before she became Republican in 2010 to run for state agriculture commissioner, said Hyde-Smith would have known why she was at a school like Lawrence County Academy. “When the public schools in Mississippi were ordered desegregated, many thousands of white families cobbled together what they could laughingly call a school to send their children to for no other reason except they didn’t want them to be around n-words or to be treated or behave as equal to black people,” Cole said. Cole attended a public school in Ellisville, Miss., and recalls making fun of the kids in town whose parents drove them 26 miles to Heidelberg Academy and back—more than 100 miles a day—just so they could have a substandard education with teachers who often had little more than a high-school diploma. “The only reason people of my generation and Cindy’s generation went to segregation academies was to keep the white kids and the black kids apart,” said Cole, who added that he is about six or seven years younger than Hyde-Smith. The student who provided the Jackson Free Press with the yearbook said she realized her parents had sent her to Lawrence County Academy to keep her from going to school with black students sometime while she was still a student. “That was just between the family, and we found out when we were old enough to question it,” the student said. “That’s how our parents felt. I didn’t learn it from anyone in the administration.” The student was younger than Hyde-Smith, and though she knew of her, she said she was too young to have any sort of relationship with the future politician. Lawrence County Academy shut down in the late 1980s due to dwindling attendance—one of the now-defunct early schools that sprang up in response to integration. Among those that survived, though, was Brookhaven Academy, where Hyde-Smith chose to send her daughter, Anna-Michael. Many started recasting themselves as Christian academies, later admitting students of color; Council McCluer, for instance, became Hillcrest Academy. Cole said Hyde-Smith “should not get a pass” for her attendance at a segregation academy, nor for later sending her daughter to one. “Socially, instinctively and intuitively, I know why these things happened, because it’s what we all lived through,” Cole said. “For the younger generation, though, this will be big news to them. Hell, it might even be big news to Cindy’s daughter. That’s the way it always was, and we were very much separate and unequal.” As of Friday night, the Hyde-Smith campaign was not prepared to comment on this story because it was too late for campaign communications director Melissa Scallan to speak to the senator, but this story will be updated if Hyde-Smith does decide to comment. The Academy and the Council Even to this day, Brookhaven Academy, from which Hyde-Smith’s daughter graduated in 2017, is almost all-white. In the 2015-2016 school year, Brookhaven Academy enrolled 386 white children, five Asian children, and just one black child, the National Center for Education Statistics shows. That’s despite the fact that Census statistics show Brookhaven is 55 percent black and 43 percent white, per 2016 Census estimates. \\"That pretty much tells me that she’s a true conservative,\\" Bridges, the NAACP president, said of Hyde-Smith's decision to send her daughter to a private school. \\"Conservatives do not really care for minorities or poor white people. A child doesn’t have a choice of where their parents send them to school, so she grew up as a child in a private school that was set up so white parents could keep their kids from going to school with African American children, and then sent her child to a private school. This is a broad generalization opinion, but I think 90 percent of the people that send their kids to private schools do it so their kids don’t have to go to school with minorities.\\" Facts about Mississippi, Secession, Slavery and the Confederacy The JFP’s archives of historically factual stories about slavery, secession and the Civil War in Mississippi, with lots of links to primary documents. In Trent Watts’ 2008 book, “White Masculinity in the Recent South,” the historian and Brookhaven native recounts an episode in which tensions over the local private academy came to the fore. “People, white and black, but whites especially, did not want bad publicity for Brookhaven,” Watts wrote. “They didn’t care if someone threw a rock, as long as nobody saw who threw it.” In 1988, Brookhaven High School hired a football coach named Hollis Rutter, who had worked previously at Brookhaven Academy, and the veneer of colorblindness was rent in two. White Brookhavenites were taken aback when black residents decried the decision to bring in a coach from a segregation academy. \\"This association with noxious institutions caused practically all black Brookhavenites to perceive Rutter as at least a tacit supporter of segregation,” Watts wrote. “In their eyes, his authority as coach and his privilege to mold young men was fatally compromised; what masculinity gave, race (or rather, black perceptions of his racism) took away.” Black ministers, NAACP leaders and black students banded together for a 10-week boycott of every facet of the town. That April, 200 black students in the school district walked out of class, with students at Brookhaven High removing the state flag from the flagpole outside the school as they went. The high school’s boys’ basketball team was reduced from 24 players to just eight, and the ninth-grade basketball team’s entire season was cancelled because there was no longer a team at all. White nationalists descended on the town to counter-protest. White business leaders, though, panicked, and soon convinced the school board to rescind its decision to hire Rutter so that regular life could resume. While the town’s white residents felt blindsided by the outrage over the hiring, it did not happen in a vacuum. Even before desegregation brought the advent of segregation academies, Brookhaven had inflicted its own special brand of pain on its black residents. Led by the (White) Citizens Council A major force behind the segregation academies was the white-supremacist organization officially called the Citizens Council and routinely referred to as the \\"White Citizens Council.\\" Brookhaven was the home of Judge Tom Brady, a white supremacist who authored “Black Monday,” the organization’s 92-page semi-official handbook soon after the Brown v. Board decision. In it, he made the case that those with “negroid” blood were inherently inferior to white people. The booklet functioned as a guide for the founding of the Citizens Council in July 1954 by Robert “Tut” Patterson, a former Mississippi State University football star. The Lies Scientific Racists Told About Jackson’s Children The Citizens Council, based in Jackson, published lies about the inferiority of African Americans for decades. It also ran whites-only academies. In the February 1972 issue of the Council’s official publication, The Citizen, the racist organization described its work to enroll white children in private schools. “It is in Mississippi that thousands of white parents have enrolled their children in the Council School Foundation's private school system rather than accept the degradation of forced race-mixing, and mass bussing of pupils as ordered for public schools by the federal courts,” the article reads. In a 1974 issue, The Citizen touted a program to help white parents in Brookhaven pay for their children to attend Brookhaven Academy. The Citizens Councils of America, based in Jackson and run for years by William J. “Bill” Simmons, the previous owner of the Fairview Inn, officially folded in 1989. By that time, another organization started using its national mailing list. The Council of Conservative Citizens, launched in 1988, held similar white-supremacist views against miscegenation (insisting that race-mixing would destroy “racial integrity”) and pushed stories about black-on-white crime to hype the violence of African Americans. That group raised money to support the state’s segregation academies every year at the Blackhawk Rally in Carroll County, one of the state’s two most popular gatherings for political campaign speeches, alongside the Neshoba County Fair. Mississippi politicians from former U.S. Sen. Trent Lott, Gov. Haley Barbour and Gov. Kirk Fordice, to current Mississippi Senate Tourism Chairwoman Lydia Chassaniol have spoken to or had close associations with the CofCC. The Council of Conservative Citizens is also the organization that Dylann Roof cited in his racist “manifesto” as the inspiration for his massacre of nine black worshipers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015. ‘She Was Scared to Death of Race’ Brookhaven’s oppressive race history, like anywhere else in Mississippi, did not begin with the academy. On Aug. 13, 1955, Lamar Smith, a black civil-rights activist, was helping black voters fill out absentee ballots for a local election so they could avoid the harassment of voting in person when three men began shouting at him. An altercation broke out, and one of the men, Noah Smith—an unrelated white man—drew a pistol and shot Lamar Smith in front of a crowd of dozens of witnesses. Neither Noah Smith nor the two men who were with him were ever indicted for the slaying; the witnesses all told a grand jury they had not seen a crime. Against this backdrop, Cindy Hyde was born four years later. Brookhaven at the time of her birth and youth might seem like a crucible for the story of race in America, but according to the ex-chairman of her former party, race has always made Hyde-Smith uncomfortable. Cole recalled her time as a Democratic state senator, and said he believed the demographic makeup of Brookhaven is part of the reason why she is uncomfortable. It was also during the time when members of the old racist Democratic Party were still transitioning into the new Republican Party that realigned to welcome old “Dixiecrats” frustrated that national Democrats supported civil-rights legislation in the 1960s. “She was scared to death of race because she was a Democrat in a district where she depended on black votes, and she knew that she had to at least give the appearance of being friendly to African American constituents, but she was mortally terrified of being overly identified with black constituents,” Cole said, adding that “the legislators she hung with were white legislators.” After getting elected to the Mississippi Senate in 1999, Hyde-Smith took up an effort to pass a law to rename a highway after Confederate President Jefferson Davis. While some have pointed to that as evidence of her affinity for the “Lost Cause” revisionist romanticization of the Civil War, Cole takes a more pedestrian view of her actions. More likely, he said, someone from the Sons of Confederate Veterans asked her to do it, because “it wouldn’t occur to her” to do it on her own. “If you asked Cindy what time it is, she would say, ‘I don’t know, what do you think?’” Cole said. “Playing both sides, that’s what she does.” Cole said that probably explains why Hyde-Smith is one of just two U.S. senators not to display the state flag outside her office in the Washington, D.C., Capitol. Because of its Confederate symbolism, Mississippi’s other U.S. senator, Roger Wicker, does not display the flag either, and called for it to be changed in 2016. “Wicker doesn’t display it, so she doesn’t display it,” Cole posited. After the Nov. 20 debate, Espy spoke with the press. Hyde-Smith, though, sent Wicker out to speak on her behalf, insisting she had to get back to her husband. Cole suspects Hyde-Smith left the Democratic Party and ran for agriculture commissioner as a Republican because she realized it had become “too closely identified with black people,” he said. “Republicans were either going to beat her in that state senate race, or she was not going to get that nomination again.” 'The South Was Right' Gov. Bryant, who appointed Hyde-Smith to the U.S. Senate after Sen. Thad Cochran resigned due to health in April, is a dues-paying members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Every April, the Jackson Free Press revealed in February 2016, Bryant proclaims “Confederate Heritage Month.” Gov. Bryant Proclaims Confederate Heritage Month The Jackson Free Press revealed to the world in February 2016 that Gov. Bryant had declared April \\"Confederate Heritage Month,\\" but with no mention of slavery. When Hyde-Smith’s daughter graduated from Brookhaven Academy in 2017, Bryant appeared to give a commencement address to her class of just 34 students as a gift. A story from The Daily Leader at the time features a photo of Bryant, Anna-Michael Smith and Cindy Hyde-Smith all astride horses as they take part in the Dixie National Rodeo. It is an event Hyde-Smith’s farm-raised family participates in yearly, alongside people of other races, including African Americans. Hyde-Smith shared a series of photos on her Facebook page in 2016 of her and her daughter at the parade. In several of the photos, though, other attendees carry Confederate flags. Her photos included a group of men dressed as Confederate soldiers marching with the flag of the Dixie Alliance, a group that maintains that the South was right to secede from the union to enter the Civil War. “Since the end of the War for Southern Independence (some call it the Civil War),” reads the Dixie Alliance website, “decades of time, Leftist influences, and unconstitutional federal actions have proven that the South was right to exercise its moral and legal grounds to declare independence.” Through its work, the group says, “Leftist influences will decline, division and hatred will subside, and the symbols and monuments of the Confederacy of America will be preserved.” Earlier this week, a photo Hyde-Smith posted on Facebook in 2014 surfaced, showing her wearing a Confederate uniform as she toured Beauvoir in Biloxi—the historic home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis where you can buy books like “The South Was Right.” “Mississippi history at its finest,” Hyde-Smith captioned the photo. Beauvoir is owned and managed by members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who, like the Alliance, seek to recast the South’s role in the Civil War in a positive light. Hyde-Smith has made no explicit endorsement of groups like the Dixie Alliance, nor has she made it a cause to defend the state flag or Confederate monuments. Like segregation academies, Confederate uniforms, Dixie parades, and colloquialisms that recall Mississippi’s history of lynching, however, it is another detail of her life that demonstrates the ubiquitous, and at times banal, nature of the role of white-supremacist culture in her upbringing and adult life. Hyde-Smith Faces Espy in Debate, Nov. 27 Runoff No matter who wins, the Nov. 27 runoff will be historic. When Gov. Phil Bryant appointed her, Hyde-Smith became the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress and could be the first duly elected come November. If Espy wins, he would be the first black U.S. senator from the state since Reconstruction, when Sens. Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce represented the state in Washington, D.C., until the end of Reconstruction brought the disenfranchisement of black voters. Around 900,000 Mississippians voted in this year's election—a midterm turnout record of 40 percent, up from 29.7 percent in 2014. Anyone who registered to vote by Oct. 29 will be eligible to vote in the runoff, even if they could not vote in the Nov. 6 election. Voters must have a valid form of photo ID, such as a driver's license or student ID. The Secretary of State's website has a full list of acceptable forms of ID.

Cindy Hyde-Smith once promoted a measure that praised a Confederate soldier's effort to \\"defend his homeland\\" and pushed a revisionist view of the Civil War. Hyde-Smith, a Republican, faces Mike Espy, a Democratic former congressman and agriculture secretary, in Tuesday's runoff in Mississippi -- the final Senate race to be decided in 2018. The measure , which was unearthed by CNN's KFile during a review of Hyde-Smith's legislative history, is the latest in a series of issues that have surfaced during her campaign, many of which have evoked Mississippi's dark history of racism and slavery. As a state senator in 2007, Hyde-Smith cosponsored a resolution that honored then-92-year-old Effie Lucille Nicholson Pharr, calling her \\"the last known living 'Real Daughter' of the Confederacy living in Mississippi.\\" Pharr's father had been a Confederate soldier in Robert E. Lee's army in the Civil War. The resolution refers to the Civil War as \\"The War Between the States.\\" It says her father \\"fought to defend his homeland and contributed to the rebuilding of the country.\\" It says that with \\"great pride,\\" Mississippi lawmakers \\"join the Sons of Confederate Veterans\\" to honor Pharr. The measure \\"rests on an odd combination of perpetuating both the Confederate legacy and the idea that this was not really in conflict with being a good citizen of the nation,\\" said Nina Silber, the president of the Society of Civil War Historians and a Boston University history professor. \\"I also think it's curious that this resolution -- which ostensibly is about honoring the 'daughter' -- really seems to be an excuse to glorify the Confederate cause,\\" Silber said. The Sons of Confederate Veterans, according to the group's website , is a \\"historical, patriotic, and non-political organization dedicated to insuring that a true history of the 1861-1865 period is preserved.\\" The group says on its website that \\"The preservation of liberty and freedom was the motivating factor in the South's decision to fight the Second American Revolution.\\" The concurrent resolution was approved by Mississippi's House and Senate. Hyde-Smith served as a state senator from 2000 to 2012. She was a Democrat before switching parties in 2010, citing her conservative beliefs. Hyde-Smith's campaign did not respond Saturday to a request for comment on the resolution. News of the 2007 measure comes amid increased scrutiny of Hyde-Smith's past after a series of recordings surfaced that featured her making comments about attending a \\"public hanging\\" and suppressing the votes of students in the state. Hyde-Smith was recorded telling supporters in Tupelo earlier this month that she'd be \\"on the front row\\" if one of her supporters there \\"invited me to a public hanging\\" -- a phrase her campaign called an \\"exaggerated expression of regard.\\" The same progressive blogger who published the video later published one in which she told a small group at Mississippi State University that suppressing the votes of students at other colleges was \\"a great thing.\\" Her campaign said it was a joke. On Friday, the Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith attended a private high school that was founded in 1970 so that white parents could avoid attempts to integrate schools by sending their children to schools without black students. Hyde-Smith's daughter later attended a similar private school established around the same time, according to the Free Press. Hyde-Smith campaign spokeswoman Melissa Scallan, when asked to comment on the report, attacked the \\"liberal media,\\" saying in a statement, \\"They have stooped to a new low, attacking her entire family and trying to destroy her personally instead of focusing on the clear differences on the issues between Cindy Hyde-Smith and her far-left opponent.\\" The 2007 resolution wasn't the only legislation Hyde-Smith backed that would elevate Mississippi's Confederate history. The Washington Post reported that in 2001, Hyde-Smith introduced a bill as a state senator to rename a stretch of highway to what it had been called in the 1930s: the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway, after the president of the Confederacy. And in photos posted to her Facebook account in 2014, Hyde-Smith was pictured posing with Confederate artifacts during a visit to Beauvoir, the home and library of Davis. The caption on the post read, \\"Mississippi history at its best!\\" Mississippi still displays the Confederate battle flag within its state flag. But more critical attention has been paid toward Confederate monuments, symbols and icons in recent years, particularly after the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting and white supremacists' march in Charlottesville, Virginia. Hyde-Smith and Espy debated Tuesday night. But otherwise, Hyde-Smith's campaign has kept her mostly out of public eye and away from the press -- eschewing the usual event-after-event sprint to Election Day -- as controversy over racially insensitive remarks she'd made earlier this month swirled. Several companies that donated to Hyde-Smith's campaign, including Walmart, have publicly withdrawn their support for the senator over the \\"public hanging\\" comment. In her debate with Espy, Hyde-Smith said she would \\"certainly apologize\\" to anyone who was offended by her remark about attending a \\"public hanging.\\" But she quickly pivoted into attack mode. \\"I also recognize that this comment was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\\" she said. |||||Summary:","completion":"Mississippi Sen.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. the chop is already broke. Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","completion":"The sentiment embodied by the phrase \\"the chop is already broke\\" appears to convey a sense of resignation, acceptance, or even hopelessness towards a specific situation or condition. This phrase likely refers to a metaphorical \\"chop,\\" which can loosely be understood as a unique or valuable attribute, situation, or endeavour. In this context, the term \\"broke\\" is an informal way of indicating that the element in question has been damaged, is no longer functioning as intended, or has failed in its purpose. Consequently, the overall message we understand here is that something important has lost its value or meaning within the context it is being discussed. In order to provide a more detailed analysis of the sentiment, we can break it down into several key emotional components. Here are some plausible interpretations of the emotions behind this phrase: 1. Resignation: The tweet may stem from a feeling of resignation over a particular situation or matter. This could signify not only the end of a positive circumstance, but also the individual's understanding that this change is inevitable and beyond their control. The person tweeting this might have exhausted all attempts to remedy the situation and is now simply accepting their fate, knowing that there is nothing left to do. 2. Frustration: This sentiment could reflect a sense of frustration stemming from the belief that opportunities to enact meaningful change have slipped away. The individual may have faced various setbacks or challenges that ultimately led to the failure of the particular \\"chop\\" mentioned in the tweet. Additionally, this frustration could be fueled by the fact that the person had invested significant time and effort into preserving or fixing the situation, only to be met with failure. 3. Disappointment: The phrase could convey a deep sense of disappointment in realizing that something that was once treasured, valuable, or successful has lost its appeal or efficacy. This could result from a combination of external influences and personal expectations that did not come to fruition. The individual may also feel let down by the people or circumstances involved in the deteriorated situation and view them as bearing some responsibility for the broken \\"chop.\\" 4. Nostalgia: A feeling of nostalgia for a past era or time when the \\"chop\\" was functional and purposeful may also be present in this sentiment. The person might be recalling the moments of happiness, success, or satisfaction associated with the past situation and comparing it to the present predicament where the once-meaningful entity is no longer effective. 5. Hopelessness: Finally, there could be a profound sense of hopelessness felt by the individual, as they come to grips with the irreparable damage or loss that has occurred. With the \\"chop\\" already broken, they might not foresee any possible way to recover, fix, or rebuild the situation, leading to a feeling of helplessness and despair. In summary, the sentiment embodied by the tweet, \\"the chop is already broke,\\" likely conveys a complex emotional landscape marked by resignation, frustration, disappointment, nostalgia, and hopelessness. It is important to consider the context in which this phrase is used to more accurately assess its underlying emotions and implications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

It predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date (\\"The Trip\\", \\"Joy Ride\\", \\"Jeepers Creepers\\") where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist. The killer himself is quite creepy, and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black, while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire, as scanty and stonewashed as it may be). Director Bill Crain does some really great things with his camera, some neat tricks on screen, and the cast tries their absolute best. There's enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans, and enough T&A from a couple of the girls to please T&A fans. Overall, this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as it's proved quite rare to find on video. Highly recommended. Choose your answer.

Answer the following question. ‘What You See is What You Get’ is the autobiography of which British businessman?","completion":"\\"What You See is What You Get\\" is the autobiography of British businessman and retail tycoon Sir Alan Sugar. Born on March 24, 1947, in Hackney, London, Sir Alan is known for his entrepreneurial acumen, ambition, and remarkable success in the world of business. The self-made billionaire is the founder of Amstrad (short for Alan Michael Sugar Trading), a company established in 1968 that initially specialized in electrical goods and would later expand its ventures into other industries, such as computers, telecommunications, and media. In his autobiography, which was published in 2010, Sir Alan Sugar shares his life story and takes the readers through a compelling journey filled with personal anecdotes, insights, and advice. This captivating narrative sheds light on his humble beginnings as a son of a working-class family, his first forays into business selling car aerials, and his subsequent rise to the heights of business success. One of the most influential entrepreneurs in the United Kingdom, he candidly discusses his successes and failures, and how he built Amstrad into a company worth over £1 billion at its peak. In 2000, Sugar was knighted for his services to the home computer and electronics industry. Over the years, he also became an investor and television personality, appearing in several shows to share his wisdom and knowledge. Perhaps most notably, he has been the leading figure of the British television show \\"The Apprentice,\\" which started airing in 2005. Modeled after the American version starring Donald Trump (before Trump became the 45th President of the United States), \\"The Apprentice\\" features Sir Alan Sugar setting tasks and challenges for aspiring entrepreneurs, each aspiring to win a coveted investment partnership with him. Throughout his career, Sir Alan Sugar has faced various obstacles, including changing market dynamics, economic downturns, and fierce competition, but his resilience and determination have helped him overcome these challenges. He has also held various executive positions, including the chairman of English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur from 1991 to 2001. \\"What You See is What You Get\\" provides readers with a fascinating look at the life, career, and personal experiences of Sir Alan Sugar, a prominent figure in UK business, offering valuable lessons and inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs and business professionals alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"It is likely that terrible events will be experienced because of everything that is happening around the world.\\"? OPT: [A]. yes [B]. it is not possible to tell [C]. no","completion":"Based on the events occurring around the world, it is understandable to assume that there might be a possibility of experiencing a series of terrible events--wrenching calamities that are economic, social, or environmental in nature. However, the question of whether it is \\"likely\\" that these terrible events will be experienced is not straightforward and depends on multiple factors. To answer the query, we can consider it from various perspectives: 1. Environmental Factors: Climate change is responsible for extreme weather phenomena, resulting in floods, droughts, forest fires, hurricanes, and landslides. The increase in global temperature also leads to the melting of polar ice caps and rising sea levels, threatening to submerge coastal cities. These events contribute to the validity of Option A, suggesting that it is likely that terrible events will be experienced due to current environmental issues. 2. Socio-Political Factors: The current world political scenario is fraught with conflicts and tensions between various nations, leading to unrest and the potential for escalated violence. Additionally, social issues such as racism, inequality, and poverty are contributing to civil unrest and protest movements. These factors could lead to more significant conflicts and struggles, offering credence to Option A. 3. Economic Factors: The world economy is interconnected, meaning that the financial crisis in one country or region may well lead to a cascading series of adverse economic events across the globe. Events such as the 2008 financial crisis, trade wars, and the recent economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that negative economic consequences on a global scale are not unlikely, reinforcing Option A. 4. Human Adaptability and Technological Progress: Humans have demonstrated their ability to adapt and respond to crises throughout history. Advancements in technology and innovation have allowed for more effective management of various challenges, such as healthcare, food security, and disaster response. One could argue that this adaptability and progress may mitigate the severity and frequency of terrible events, providing a case for Option B or C. Given these perspectives, it is important to recognize that the probability of experiencing terrible events depends on our ability to address and mitigate the various economic, social, and environmental issues we face. While there is some validity to the statement that \\"It is likely that terrible events will be experienced because of everything that is happening around the world,\\" it remains crucial to emphasize that it is not an absolute certainty and that we, as a global society, have the power to change the course of future events. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be: [B] It is not possible to tell This response emphasizes the complexity and uncertainty of the situation, as well as the potential for change through human action and adaptability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Procol Harum are an English rock band formed in 1967. They contributed to the development of symphonic rock, and by extension, progressive rock. Their best-known recording is their 1967 hit single \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", which is considered a classic of popular music and is one of the few singles to have sold over 10 million copies. Although noted for its baroque and classical influence, Procol Harum's music also embraces the blues, R&B, and soul. - A power trio is a rock and roll band format having a lineup of guitar, bass and drums, leaving out the second guitar or keyboard that are used in other rock music quartets and quintets to fill out the sound with chords. While one or more band members typically sing, power trios emphasize instrumental performance and overall impact over vocals and lyrics. History. The rise of the power trio in the 1960s was made possible in part by developments in amplifier technology that greatly enhanced the volume of the electric guitar and bass. Particularly, the popularization of the electric bass guitar defined the bottom end and filled in the gaps. Since the amplified bass could also now be louder, the rest of the band could also play at higher volumes, without fear of being unable to hear the bass. This allowed a three-person band to have the same sonic impact as a large band but left far more room for improvisation and creativity, unencumbered by the need for detailed arrangements. As with the organ trio, a 1960s-era soul jazz group centered on the amplified Hammond organ, a three-piece group could fill a large bar or club with a big sound for a much lower price than a large rock and roll band. A power trio, at least in its blues rock incarnation, is also generally held to have developed out of Chicago-style blues bands such as Muddy Waters' trio. - Robin Leonard Trower (born 9 March 1945) is an English rock guitarist and vocalist who achieved success with Procol Harum during the 1960s, and then again as the bandleader of his own power trio. - 20th Century Blues is the fifteenth studio album by Robin Trower .

The answer is:","completion":"The missing first step in the process of the flashlight operation is: - The user activates the flashlight's power button or switch. Here is the complete detailed process, including the missing first step, for the flashlight operation: 1. The user activates the flashlight's power button or switch: The user manually activates the power button or switch which is usually located on the body of the flashlight. This switch controls the flow of current through the flashlight circuitry. 2. The flashlight is turned on: As the user activates the power button or switch, the flashlight is turned on, initiating the process of producing light. 3. Two contact strips touch one another: When the power button is toggled or the switch is slid, this action causes two metal contact strips to come into contact. This contact creates an electrical connection necessary to complete the circuit. 4. A circuit is completed between the batteries and the lamp: As the contact strips touch one another, an electrical circuit is established, allowing electric current to flow from the batteries through the contact strips and into the lamp. 5. The lamp in the flashlight begins to glow: The electrical current passing through the lamp causes the filament, LED, or other lighting technology inside the lamp to produce light. The lamp begins to glow, providing visible light. 6. The reflector in the flashlight directs the lamp's beam: The flashlight often features a reflector or lens system situated around the lamp. The reflector captures and directs the light emitted from the lamp to create a focused, intense beam. 7. A straight beam of light is generated: Due to the reflector's parabolic or curved shape, the light emitted from the lamp is concentrated into a straight, forward-directed beam. This allows the flashlight to illuminate objects at various distances effectively. 8. The flashlight is turned off: The user deactivates the power button or switch, disrupting the flow of current in the circuit. The flashlight is turned off, stopping the production of light. 9. The circuit is broken: When the power button or switch is deactivated, the metal contact strips move away from each other, breaking the electrical connection and stopping the flow of current in the circuit. 10. The beam is no longer visible: With the circuit broken and the flashlight turned off, the lamp inside the flashlight ceases to glow, and the beam of light is no longer visible. This detailed process explains the functioning of a flashlight from the initial activation of the power button until it is turned off and the beam is no longer visible."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: Too many people want exotic snakes.

He is best known for his solo material, and as a member of Fistful of Mercy and RNDM. Combining poetic lyrics with a layered sonic palette, Arthur has built his reputation over the years through critically acclaimed releases and constant touring; his unique solo live performances often incorporate the use of a number of distortion and loop pedals, and his shows are recorded live at the soundboard and made available to concertgoers immediately following the show on recordable media. Arthur was discovered by Peter Gabriel in the mid-1990s, and signed to Gabriel's Real World label as the first North American artist on the label's roster. Arthur signed a new recording contract with Vector Recordings and began recording his fourth studio album, Our Shadows Will Remain across New Orleans, New York City, London, and Prague. The album was released in September 2004, and was Arthur's first album to feature string arrangements, provided by the City of Prague Philharmonic. The album was released to widespread critical acclaim; Allmusic's Thom Jurek awarded the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising that, \\"Arthur is in a class of his own and Our Shadows Will Remain is a monstrous, memorable outing, his finest moment in a career that is thus far full of them.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A rating, hailing the album as \\"especially forceful and cohesive\\"; The Guardian hailed that Joseph \\"might just be a genuine mad genius\\"; Stylus Magazine gave the album an A- rating; and Chris Rubin of Rolling Stone named Our Shadows Will Remain as the number 1 album of the year 2004 in the year-end critics' pick list. Arthur toured the US alone and with Joan Wasser to promote the album, and a new EP called And the Thieves Are Gone, which collected unreleased tracks from the Shadows recording sessions, came out in December. Shortly afterward, Arthur went on a brief tour of Europe with R.E.M.. Our Shadows Will Remain was picked up by 14th Floor Records for distribution in the United Kingdom in 2005, which yielded the release of four singles: \\"Can't Exist\\" in July, \\"Even Tho\\" in September, \\"Devil's Broom\\" in February 2006 to coincide with his first headlining appearance at London's Shepherds Bush Empire, and a reissue of \\"Can't Exist\\" in May 2006, although none of the singles charted on the UK Singles Chart.

It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of.

Choose your answer from: a). yes b). it is not possible to tell c). no","completion":"a). Yes Based on the premise provided, it is true that glass making furnaces were moved from the city center to an island. The context clearly states that \\"Venetians have been manufacturing glass on the island of Murano since 1292, when the hazardous furnaces were moved away from the city center.\\" The statement explicitly mentions the movement of hazardous furnaces (used for glassmaking) from the city center to the island of Murano. This information supports the hypothesis that \\"Glass making furnaces were moved from the city center to an island.\\" The historical context for this move can be further explained. In 1291, the Venetian Republic ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to the island of Murano, which is located in the Venetian Lagoon, not far from the main city of Venice. The reasons behind this decision were twofold: to reduce the risk of fires caused by the intense heat of the glass furnaces, and to protect the secrets of Venetian glassmaking techniques. Glass furnaces posed a significant fire hazard, especially in cities where buildings were primarily constructed from wood, as was the case in medieval Venice. By moving the glassmaking industry to Murano, Venice could better control the potential threat of devastating fires and guarantee the safeguarding of proprietary glassblowing techniques. Murano became an important center for glassmaking and was renowned for its craftsmanship and technical expertise, forging a tradition that continues to be revered today. In summary, based on the premise, the hypothesis \\"Glass making furnaces were moved from the city center to an island\\" is true. The Venetian Republic's decision to move the glass furnaces from Venice's city center to the island of Murano was a strategic choice aimed at ensuring the safety of the city and preserving the secrets of a highly lucrative craft."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Finnish has a heavy emphasis on vowels, and its alphabet contains some vowels that are not used in English. Before you start studying Finnish, you should learn how to read and pronounce its alphabet. Since Finnish words are spelled exactly how they are pronounced, this will help you learn vocabulary more quickly. A (IPA: /a/): pronounced like English “father” or “calm” O (IPA: /o/): pronounced like a prolonged 'o' in 'or'. U (IPA: /u/): pronounced like the English 'U' in 'Uber'. I (IPA: /i/): pronounced like the English 'ea' in 'Easter' or 'e' in 'email' E (IPA: /e/): pronounced like “bed” Ä (IPA: /ae/): pronounced like English 'a' in \\"hat” Ö (IPA: /ø/): pronounced like English 'i' in “girl” Y (IPA: /y/): No clear equivalent, although briefly appears in the words ex. \\"to\\", \\"you\\", and \\"new\\". Similar to the German “ü.” A double vowel in a word simply means that you pronounce it for twice as long. Most consonants in Finnish are pronounced similarly to those in English. This includes the pronunciation for the letters D, L, M, N, NG, P, S, and T. However, Finnish consonants are cleaner and consonants such as T don't have any \\"h\\" quality to them and thus sounds closer to a D. The letters B, C, F, G, Q, X, and Z are only used in loanwords.There are a few differences between English and Finnish consonants. These include: Always pronounce H. Your H should sound breathy, as though you are puffing air every time you pronounce it. J is pronounced like “y” is in English. V is weaker in Finnish than in English. As you pronounce it, try touching your teeth against your bottom lip very lightly. A double consonant (such as in the word takka) is pronounced with a brief pause or hesitation between the two consonants. W and X are not used in Finnish except in loan words. It is good to have a stock of simple phrases you can use to say hello and goodbye to people. Practice repeating these phrases back to yourself. You can also listen to videos or audio clips online to help you get used to hearing the language as well. Some good phrases are: Hei: hi, hello Moi: hello (informal, used with friends) Hyvää huomenta: Good morning Hyvää päivää: Good day Hyvää iltaa: good evening Mitä kuuluu?: How are you? Nähdään myöhemmin: See you later Hauska tavata: Nice to meet you Tervetuloa: Welcome Kiitos: Thank you Anteeksi: sorry, excuse me Näkemiin: goodbye To have a conversation in Finnish, you may find it useful to start by asking questions. These conversational questions can let you practice responding in Finnish while helping you get the information you need. Paljonko tämä maksaa?: How much does this cost? Anteeksi, missä on _____?: Excuse me, where is ________? Voisitteko auttaa minua?: Could you please help me? Puhutko englantia: Do you speak English? Mistä sinä olet kotoisin?: Where are you from? Minä olen kotoisin_____: I am from _____. Mikä sinun nimesi on?: What is your name? Minun nimeni on_______: My name is_________. Numbers are important to help you find and buy things while you are in a Finland. After learning one through ten in Finnish, you can attach endings to make numbers 11-90. one = yksi two = kaksi three = kolme four = neljä five = viisi six = kuusi seven = seitsemän eight = kahdeksan nine = yhdeksän ten = kymmenen For numbers 11-19, all you have to do is to add the word -toista in the end of the finnish number between 1-9. (eleven= yksitoista; twelve=kaksitoista; thirteen = kolmetoista, etc.) For the numbers 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90, just take a number between 1-9 and add the word -kymmentä, at the end. Example: Kaksi (two) + -kymmentä = Kaksikymmentä, which means twenty in Finnish.","completion":"Learn the Finnish alphabet, pronunciation, basic phrases, and numbers to communicate effectively and enhance vocabulary learning in a language that emphasizes vowels and is spelled phonetically."},{"prompt":"Q:Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising? In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

He is using word association and dream interpretation as part of his approach to Sigmund Freud's (Viggo Mortensen) radical new science of psychoanalysis, and finds that Sabina Spielrein's condition was triggered by the humiliation and sexual arousal she felt as a child due to her short-tempered father's habit of spanking her naked. These conflicting feelings were compounded by her instinctive knowledge (imparted by an angel's voice that speaks in German) that she had done nothing to deserve such a punishment and in fact that she may have been a stand-in for her mother in her father's abuse (since her mother was unfaithful). Also, her affluent Russian Jewish family afforded her an exceptional education in preparation for university study, although not on the subject of sex, and she was a virgin.Her intelligence and energy were immediately recognized and encouraged by Jung and Eugen Bleule (André Hennicker), the head of the hospital, and since she plans to study medicine they allow her to assist them in their experiments, including measuring the physical reactions of subjects during word association, to provide empirical data as a scientific basis for psychoanalysis and ameliorate the more sensational aspects of Freud's theories, which contend that all mental illness is rooted in childhood sexual experience, be it real or fantasy. She soon learns that much of this new science is founded on the doctors' observations of themselves, each other, and their families, not just their patients.

Many of these groups have taken a critical stance against the electoral process and have chosen to decry the upcoming vote. A joint statement was released, accusing the Kremlin of not providing the necessary conditions for an open, transparent, and competitive election. This sentiment has been echoed by liberal politicians and activists, who assert that the vote will not be an accurate representation of the Russian public's preferences. These groups argue that numerous irregularities, media manipulation, and biased electoral commissions have paved the way for an unfair political playing field. In turn, that plays into the hands of leaders who are determined to maintain power at any cost. Furthermore, critics claim that opposition candidates have been unfairly excluded from the process, essentially undermining the foundation of democratic governance. As a result, there has been a renewed call for a boycott of the upcoming presidential vote. Civilians and political figures alike have joined forces in an effort to get their message across: that a vote under these conditions would only serve to legitimize an inherently flawed process. By abstaining from voting, organizers of the boycott hope to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the current system and to express their demands for genuine electoral reforms. However, there are concerns that the boycott might not accomplish its intended goals. Some experts argue that refusing to participate in the electoral process could lead to even more political polarization and reinforce the existing power dynamics. Additionally, they suggest that a boycott might deter potential voters from engaging with the electoral system altogether, further isolating both critics and proponents of the election. Despite these concerns, the boycott movement continues to gain traction, particularly via social media platforms and grassroots organizations. One of the movement's key figures is opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been barred from running in the election on the grounds of a previous conviction. Navalny claims that his exclusion is politically motivated and has urged his supporters to stand together and refuse to vote in protest. The upcoming Russian presidential vote has become a battleground for political ideologies, with human rights groups and liberal organizations standing firmly in opposition to what they perceive as an undemocratic electoral process. The calls for a boycott demonstrate the profound frustration felt by many Russian citizens who fear that their voices will not be heard in the impending vote. As tensions rise and the election day nears, it remains to be seen whether the boycott will prove to be an effective tool for change or an unsuccessful gesture that results in unintended consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? the screenplay to keep the film entertaining","completion":"The given statement is quite brief and does not provide enough context to definitively conclude whether the opinion of the movie is positive or negative. However, we can analyze the statement to understand the underlying sentiment it conveys. The statement mentions the \\"screenplay\\" as a means to \\"keep the film entertaining.\\" The word \\"entertaining\\" typically has a positive connotation, implying that the movie might potentially be enjoyable to watch. Keeping the viewers entertained is one of the primary objectives of a movie, and an effective screenplay can contribute significantly to that end. On this basis, one might infer that the statement leans towards a positive opinion. However, there is also some ambiguity in the statement, as it does not explicitly express whether or not the screenplay was successful in achieving its intended goal of entertainment. It only points out that the intention was to maintain the entertainment factor. It is possible that the review's author found that the movie's screenplay attempted to keep the film entertaining but did not achieve this objective. In conclusion, while the statement does seem to lean towards a positive opinion due to the mention of the film being entertaining, there is not enough concrete information to definitively establish whether the opinion is positive or negative. To accurately assess the sentiment of the review, it would be helpful to have more context or more descriptive statements that clarify the reviewer's perspective on the movie's overall quality and effectiveness."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: More than 40 years ago, John Williams gave away all of his belongings and went off to the mountains to live the way people lived 100 years ago. For food he traps wild animals, fishes in the rivers, and plants whatever he can. John lives in a cabin he made by hand, out of trees he chopped down with an ax. Though he has no s he knows of, he does have a deer he raised from a fawn. The deer lives in the house in the winter and goes with John when he goes into the forest for food. Nobody lives within fifty miles of his cabin in the mountains and John has not been out of the mountains during the entire forty years. One day last year I hiked in to see how John lives. It was like going back in time. There were no roads, no stores, no noise, no pollution, not even a post office. Most notable of all, there were no people and that's just the way John Williams wants to keep his part of the world--without people. But there is a paradox in his story. John is an educated man. He has books and nobody knows how he got them. Mostly he reads about his world, the forest, the animals, the plants, and the mountains. He has seen airplanes flying overhead but does not want to know about them. For him, electricity is lightning, not light bulbs, refrigerators, televisions, or washing machines. John Williams is 85 years old and had not had a sick day in his life. He attributes his long life to the fact that it has nothing to do with people and in order that he might enjoy many more years of health, happiness, and solitude, I will not tell you where his kingdom lies.

When your dog is having a nightmare, your first instinct may be to wake up your dog. However, this isn't always the best idea.","completion":"Assess the severity of the nightmare. Before deciding whether or not to wake up your dog from a nightmare, assess the severity of the situation. If the dog appears to be just whimpering or twitching, the nightmare may be mild, and waking them up might cause more stress. In contrast, if the dog seems extremely distressed, is howling, or engaged in violent physical movements, it may be necessary to intervene. Approach your dog carefully. If you decide to wake your dog, approach them carefully and calmly to avoid startling them further. Keep in mind that a dog awakened abruptly from a deep sleep may become disoriented and may snap or act defensively due to their disoriented state. Make sure you do not touch them abruptly or make any loud noises. Use gentle touch and voice. To gently wake your dog from a nightmare, softly call their name or make gentle, soothing sounds. Rest a hand on their back, shoulder, or head, and apply a little bit of gentle pressure. This light touch can help to ground and comfort them as they transition from sleep to wakefulness. Create a calm environment. Once your dog is awake, it is important to create a calm and comforting environment to help them transition from the nightmare and feel secure. Keep the lighting low and use a soft, soothing tone of voice when speaking to them. Offer gentle pets or cuddling, if your dog is receptive, to provide reassurance and help them relax. Provide a comforting item. If your dog has a favorite toy, blanket, or other items that bring them comfort, provide this to them to help them settle after a nightmare. The familiar scent and texture of the item can help the dog feel secure and safe. Assess any ongoing issues. It's important to monitor your dog over time and take note of any patterns or ongoing issues with nightmares. If your dog consistently experiences distressing nightmares or has difficulty sleeping, it's best to consult with a veterinarian to discuss potential underlying health or behavioral issues. Issues such as anxiety, past trauma, or medical conditions can contribute to sleep disturbances. Consider prevention measures. If your dog continues to experience nightmares, taking preventative measures can help promote a more restful sleep for your dog. Create a consistent bedtime routine that includes regular exercise, a calming environment, and possibly using calming scents like lavender or soothing music to help ease any anxiety. Maintain a sleep journal. By keeping a sleep journal, you can document the frequency, severity, and any potential triggers of your dog's nightmares. This information can help provide valuable insights to your veterinarian if you need to consult them about ongoing sleep disturbances. In conclusion, deciding whether to wake up your dog from a nightmare depends on the severity of the situation and the safety of both you and your dog. By taking the time to address their distress and considering prevention measures, you can provide a calming and secure environment for your dog, promoting better sleep and overall wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The atmosphere is filled with joy, laughter, and excited chatter. The scent of freshly baked cookies and spiced hot chocolate wafts through the air, making the ambiance even cozier. In this moment, one of the women, named Sarah, takes this opportunity to start a new family tradition. She gathers the children and adults around the Christmas tree and instructs everyone to sit down in a circle. As the small group forms a circle, Sarah reveals her surprise – a beautifully wrapped, large and mysterious gift box. She explains that this new tradition, called \\"The Gift of Stories\\", involves sharing heartwarming stories from the past year, which the family members will do as they pass around the mystery gift. Each person is to hold the gift while telling their story, and the last person who has not had a chance to share a story will unwrap the surprise gift. As the family settles down and gets comfortable, the first person begins their story. They reminisce about a memorable event from the year, which not only brings joy to the listeners but also helps everyone connect on a deeper level. As the stories are shared, the family members learn more about each other’s highs and lows, accomplishments, and challenges they have faced during the year. The gift is passed from person to person, with each individual describing their own unique anecdotes. The children attentively listen, while also eagerly anticipating their turn to hold the mystery gift. Some stories evoke emotions like happiness, love, and pride, while others are filled with humor causing laughter to ripple through the room. As the gift reaches the last person, the entire family is engulfed in a strong sense of bonding and unity. They have not only shared their own tales but also learned more about one another. As the sun sets outside, painting the sky with hues of oranges and pinks, the last person tells their story. Now comes the much-anticipated moment to unwrap the mystery gift. The anticipation in the room is palpable as the final person carefully removes the gift wrapping. Inside the box is a beautifully crafted photo album, adorned with motifs of Christmas trees and snowflakes. All of the family members are captivated by this discovery. Sarah suggests that the photo album should be filled with candid photographs from that evening and subsequent celebrations. The album will become a testament to all the Good Samaritan stories that they share in their gatherings, encapsulating the cherished moments that tie the family closer. Everyone agrees, and they all proceed to take candid photos with their smartphones and cameras, capturing smiles, embraces, and genuine expressions of love and happiness. As the evening progresses, cookie decorating and ornament crafting activities keep the children entertained, while the adults continue to share nostalgic memories, sing Christmas carols, and enjoy some quality time together. The Christmas tree's shimmering lights beautifully blanket the room in a warm glow, creating a magical atmosphere. After enjoying a hearty dinner featuring classic holiday dishes, the family gathers around the fireplace. They reflect on their newly established tradition, already looking forward to the next annual “Gift of Stories” celebration. This seemingly simple yet meaningful tradition leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of everyone present, bringing happiness to the entire family and creating a lasting memory of an unforgettable Christmas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A supporter of co-educational schools would probably say that schools should be like the societies they belong to .In Hong Kong , men and women mix socially on a day-to-day basis .In many fields men are even likely to have female bosses .It is ,therefore, desirable that boys and girls grow up together ,go to school together ,and prepare themselves for a society that does not value sexual separation. Some would go on to argue further that growing up with members of the opposite sex is important for personal development .Regular contact can remove the strange ideas about the opposite-sex and lead to more natural relationships .Single-sex conditions are seen as leading to more extreme opinions, and possibly even as encouraging homosexuality ,though there is no proof that this is the case.

What I was saying is, a culture that thinks that comic books and comic book movies are profound meditations on the human condition is a dumb (explicit) culture. And for people to get mad at that just proves my point.\\" The new interview comes days after Maher wrote a blog post on his website over the weekend that many people called disrespectful to Lee, who died Nov. 12 at the age of 95. \\"America is in mourning. Deep, deep mourning for a man who inspired millions to, I don’t know, watch a movie, I guess,\\" Maher wrote about the cultural icon responsible for many of Marvel’s most popular superheroes in comic books and movies. Lee's team at POW! Entertainment quickly fired back at the late-night host, calling his words about man \\"frankly disgusting.\\" In an open letter, Lee's team said, \\"Countless people can attest to how Stan inspired them to read, taught them that the world is not made up of absolutes, that heroes can have flaws and even villains can show humanity within their souls.\\" Maher's post continued, saying he has nothing \\"against comic books,\\" but that when he was growing up \\"comics were for kids, and when you grew up you moved on to big-boy books without the pictures. \\"But then twenty years or so ago, something happened – adults decided they didn’t have to give up kid stuff,\\" he said. \\"And so they pretended comic books were actually sophisticated literature.\\" Then the late-night host brought politics into the mix, mentioning President Donald Trump. \\"I don’t think it’s a huge stretch to suggest that Donald Trump could only get elected in a country that thinks comic books are important,\\" Maher wrote. The open letter from POW! Entertainment concluded: \\"Our shock at your comments makes us want to say ‘ ’Nuff said, Bill,' but instead we will rely on another of Stan’s lessons to remind you that you have a powerful platform, so please remember: 'With great power there must also come – great responsibility!' ” After Maher's post went online, Lee's fans jumped on social media to slam him.

Karl Baden has been taking a photo of himself every morning, in the same exact position to the best of his ability, for the last 27 years. And he doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon. “I’ll stop when I’m dead. If I’m dead, I won’t know what will happen with [my project] from there, but the plan is to have an institution acquire it in some form,” said Baden, a photography professor at Boston College. This past weekend marked roughly 9,800 days since he first started sitting down in front of a camera lens to snap a photo of himself for the “Every Day” project, which began on February 23, 1987. The daily task is part of a decades-long examination of the role that mortality plays in people’s lives, and, more obviously, how age changes one’s appearance. Barden said it also serves as a “meta comment” on the idea of obsession, and doing something repetitiously. “Artists need to be obsessive to get the work that they have to get done, done. They have to have some inner drive to do it; this is taking it to another step. This is a comment on the obsession and obsessively making work,” he said. “The idea of making and taking photographs has a lot to do with documenting things over time. Many people have attempted that in terms of looking at cities, and locations, or even one’s own family—kids growing up, that sort of thing. So I felt that it might be interesting to take it a step further.” The idea first came to mind in the 1970s, but when he brought up the concept to a friend, he was told it was “stupid.” That insight put a damper on his ambitions for more than decade, but his curiousness about taking on such a long-term project lingered in his mind. So, finally, one day he took the plunge, despite his critic’s opinion. “People asked me over the years, why did you start on that date, and to the best of my recollection, I said, ‘well, that was just the day I started it.’ There was nothing special about it, it was random,” he said. But the death of artist Andy Warhol may have played a role, in retrospect. “He made films where very little happens for a longtime, like Sleep. Thinking back now, I’m sure that Warhol’s death was the final straw. It was the thing that pushed me over the edge to start doing it. And by that time, I think that I was physically and emotionally ready.” Since the beginning, the process for “Every Day” has been something reminiscent of Groundhog Day. Baden usually wakes up, gets ready for work or the weekend, and then simply snaps the photo using the same camera and the same lighting that he has used for nearly three decades. The type of film has changed over time, he said, because only because the older products he relied on are no longer made. “I don’t do anything to change my face intentionally. I don’t grow beards or mustaches, and I keep my hair the same,” he said. “I don’t use any unusual angles, and I don’t use any unusual lenses, or filters, or lighting sources. I try to keep all artistic conceits out of the picture. I try to achieve identical images, but I can’t always, because I’m human, and I make mistakes, and the camera makes mistakes. Those are all accepted as part of the project.” Once he takes a photo, he collects the negatives and keeps them organized and well documented in a safe place, and brings them out when he needs to make prints, or in the case of one undertaking, he made to show the progression of age: a video. Taking the same photo every day for almost 30 years sounds like a daunting task, but since the start, Baden said he could only remember one time that he forgot to take a portrait of himself, and in the end, it didn’t put a serious dent in his ever-expanding project. “It’s not a very exciting story at all,” he said. “On October 15, 1991, I was teaching at [the Rhode Island School of Design], and usually I take the picture after I get up and take a shower. There was a rush to get to the school that day, and I made a mental note to take it when I got back home, and I forgot.” Since then, not a day has gone by that Baden didn’t sit down and let the camera capture a shot of his face. Over the years, as various milestones approached in terms of time since he first started, Baden has put his work on display in numerous art galleries and museums. He said he also uses the photos for projects in his classes at Boston College. When Baden set forth on his photography endeavor, he never imagined that one day the “selfie” would become a household term, and take the Internet by storm. Calling it a “distantly related topic,” he isn’t doing this project to be known as the “selfie” king, or even to land a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records—for him it’s art, and the exploration of the human condition. “It’s photography in its most fundamental form,” he said. ||||| This panel of black and white self-made photographs show Baden over the last three decades (Picture: Karl Baden/AP) This man’s selfie project begun, well, before anyone even called them selfies.

Article: The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) is out with its “Hot Wheels” list of the most stolen cars in the United States during 2016. The list is led by Honda Motor Co. Ltd.’s (NYSE: HMC) Accord. However, thieves have not been snatching new models. The 1997 Accord is the most stolen version. In fact, of the 10 most stolen cars, seven are 2008 or earlier models. Another example of this is that the second most stolen car is the Honda Civic — the 1998 model. Third on the list is the 2006 model of Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE: F) full-sized pickup. The list closely matches the top 20 best-selling cars of today. As a matter of fact, the overlap of the 10 most stolen cars to the top 20 selling cars of the first half is a match of nine out of 10. These are the Civic, Accord, Ford full-size pickup, Chevy full-size pickup, Camry, Altima, Corolla, Dodge full-size pickup and Jeep Cherokee/Grand Cherokee. The NICB commented: While Honda Accords and Civics dominate this annual list, they are older, pre-“smart key” production models. Since the introduction of smart keys and other anti-theft technology, Honda thefts have fallen precipitously. As the list of top 25 most stolen 2016 model year vehicles shows, there were only 493 thefts of Accords last year. Technology is working, but complacency can defeat it. While thefts are down dramatically since their all-time high in 1992, thousands of vehicles continue to be stolen each year because owners leave their keys or fobs in the vehicles and that invites theft. New age car technology has proven at least one of its advantages.

Far too many thefts occur because the vehicle is left unlocked and the key or fob is inside.

After the September 11 attacks, it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour. Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001. Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies. Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage. Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal. Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moore's website about the film. Gun homicides.

I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time.

Consumed by grief and an unwavering quest for revenge, Jericho embarks on a personal mission to bring down those responsible while uncovering the truth behind these brutal contract killings – unraveling a much larger and despicable conspiracy than he could ever imagine. Act 1: Jericho Cane (played by an A-list actor) lives a happy and quiet life with his loving wife, Sarah, and spirited young daughter, Emily. After serving many years in the Special Forces, Jericho started working in a private security firm to ensure a stable income for his family. Life appears to be running smoothly until the day they tragically become the collateral damage in a gruesome contract killing – an event that sets Jericho's world ablaze. Act 2: Driven by anger and heartache, Jericho begins a relentless pursuit of the merciless killers, leaving no stone unturned to avenge the deaths of his beloved wife and daughter. Using his advanced combat skills and elite military intelligence, Jericho systematically eliminates members of the crime syndicate responsible for the heinous act: foot soldiers, enforcers, and mid-level mobsters. Simultaneously, Jericho follows the breadcrumbs of cryptic messages that lead him to uncover a twisted conspiracy involving corrupt officials, high-profile businessmen, and powerful crime lords with far-reaching agendas. As the story unfolds, we learn that Jericho and his family had unwittingly witnessed illegal arms deals, high-stakes money laundering, and political assassinations. Act 3: As Jericho dives deeper and deeper into this unforgiving world of crime and corruption, he encounters Elena, a mysterious and skilled assassin (played by a renowned female actress) who seems to share common enemies with Jericho. Allying with Elena, Jericho learns valuable information about her dark past – and they both come to realize that their paths were destined to cross. Together, Jericho and Elena infiltrate the criminal organizations' inner circle, with their ultimate goal being the mastermind responsible for the contract killings – The Puppeteer, a shadowy and ruthless individual who pulls strings from the shadows. A high-stakes and action-packed climax ensues, with an intense firefight in The Puppeteer's hidden lair. We witness a showdown between Jericho, Elena, and their sworn enemies, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats.

A Milton Keynes woman has set up a JustGiving page to raise money for a homeless man who helped her find her way home from London. Nicole Sedgebeer, 21, was on a work night out in the capital last Thursday (March 9) when she became stranded outside Euston at about 3am. With the station doors locked and her phone out of battery, Nicole was alone and fearful of what to do next. But in her hour of need, a homeless man called Mark walked her to a nearby all-night café to make sure she was safe, and even led her back to Euston in time for the first train home at about 5.25am. Stunned by his kindness, Nicole posted her story on Facebook to thank him, and says the experience has changed her view on homelessness. She said: \\"I was a bit emotional and panicked, so I approached Mark and asked him what should I do? \\"We had a motivational speaker come into work recently, and he mentioned about moments in life you will never forget, and this is one of them for me. \\"We are so caught up in our normal day-to-day life, we walk past and do not think about their stories. Now I think completely differently – it has completely changed my perception.\\" After sharing several phone conversations since, the pair are due to appear on ITV this evening (March 9) after Nicole's Facebook post went viral – racking up almost 13,000 shares. To thank Mark for his help, Nicole has set-up a JustGiving page and is aiming to raise £1,000 to help support her new friend.\\" She added: \\"We had breakfast and he told me about his life.

She is also a highly skilled race car driver, but is sometimes haunted by memories of her father's death at a NASCAR race many years ago. Meanwhile, on another side of town, Carlo (Nathan Phillips) has just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq. He meets up with his brother Jason (Jesse Johnson) before heading to Vegas themselves. Carlo is not happy that Jason is living with their mob boss uncle Michael D'Orazio (Angus Macfadyen), whom he always sees as the cause of their family's destruction. Little do they know that Michael has been running an unsuccessful counterfeiting ring and owes millions of dollars to another syndicate led by the \\"Godfather\\" (David Dayan Fisher). On the outskirts of Vegas, a high-stakes race event is being held, with Michael, Infamous, Hollywood producer Jerry Brecken (Tim Matheson) and Chinese businessman Marcus Cheng (Michael Hagiwara) placing their bets over who has the better car. When Infamous' driver fakes an ankle injury, Natasha becomes Infamous' driver in exchange for 300,000 and a recording contract. However, she is unaware that Infamous has to place her on his wager, as Michael - who has been obsessed with her since watching her band perform on stage earlier - has placed four platinum bars at stake.

Write some highlights for the following article: Iraqi authorities are detaining thousands of women illegally and subjecting many to torture because of crimes they allege their husbands committed, a Human Rights Watch report has claimed. Many women were detained for months or even years without charge while security forces questioned them about their male relatives' activities rather than crimes in which they themselves were implicated, HRW says. In custody, women described being kicked, slapped, hung upside-down, beaten on the soles of their feet, given electric shocks, threatened with sexual assault by security forces during interrogation, and even raped in front of their relatives and children. 'The abuses of women we documented. are in many ways at the heart of the current crisis in Iraq,' said HRW's. deputy Middle East and North Africa director Joe Stork in a statement. accompanying the report, titled: 'No One Is Safe: Abuses of Women in. Iraq's Criminal Justice System.' Iraqi authorities have detained thousands of women without charge and subjected them to torture because of crimes their husbands allegedly committed, the Human Rights Watch claims (stock image of two Iraqi women in 2003) Mr. Stark added: 'These abuses have caused a deep-seated anger and lack of. trust between Iraq's diverse communities and security forces, and all. Iraqis are paying the price.' A. spokesman for Iraq's Human Rights Ministry said the testimonies in the. HRW report were 'over-exaggerated', but acknowledged that 'we have some. limited illegal behaviours which were practised by security forces. against women prisoners', which it said had been identified by the. ministry's own teams. These. teams had referred their reports to the relevant authorities, 'asking. them to bring those who are responsible for mistreating female detainees. to justice', the spokesman said. 'Iraq. is still working to put an end to prison abuse and, with more time,. understanding of law and patience, such illegal practices will become a. history,' he said. The. 105-page report is based on interviews with imprisoned Sunni and Shi'ite. women and girls, although Sunnis make up the vast majority of the more. than 4,200 women detained in Interior and Defence Ministry facilities,. HRW said. The release of women detainees was a main demand of Sunnis who began demonstrating late in 2012 against the Shi'ite-led government, which they accuse of marginalising their community. Revelations: The alleged abuses were revealed in the Human Rights Watch report entitled 'No One Is Safe: Abuses Of Women In Iraq's Criminal Justice System' Security forces cleared one of two Sunni protest camps in Anbar province in December 2013. In the ensuing backlash, militants seized the city of Falluja and parts of Ramadi. Since then, more than 1,000 people have been killed across Iraq, according to Iraq Body Count, and the army is preparing for a possible ground assault to retake Falluja. One woman who entered her meeting with HRW at a death row facility in Baghdad on crutches said she had been permanently disabled by abuse, displaying injuries consistent with the mistreatment she alleged. Seven months later, she was executed despite lower court rulings that dismissed charges against her following a medical report that supported her accusations of torture. HRW described Iraq's judiciary as weak and plagued by corruption, with convictions frequently based on coerced confessions, and trial proceedings that fall far short of international standards. If women are released unharmed, they are frequently stigmatised by their family or community, who perceive them to have been dishonoured, HRW said. 'Both men and women suffer from the severe flaws of the criminal justice system. But women suffer a double burden due to their second-class status in Iraqi society,' HRW said.","completion":"A Human Rights Watch (HRW) report has claimed that Iraqi authorities are illegally detaining thousands of women and subjecting many to torture due to alleged crimes committed by their husbands.

Solve this instance: Real-life control tasks involve matters of various substances---rigid or soft bodies, liquid, gas---each with distinct physical behaviors. This poses challenges to traditional rigid-body physics engines. Particle-based simulators have been developed to model the dynamics of these complex scenes; however, relying on approximation techniques, their simulation often deviates from real-world physics, especially in the long term. In this paper, we propose to learn a particle-based simulator for complex control tasks. Combining learning with particle-based systems brings in two major benefits: first, the learned simulator, just like other particle-based systems, acts widely on objects of different materials; second, the particle-based representation poses strong inductive bias for learning: particles of the same type have the same dynamics within. This enables the model to quickly adapt to new environments of unknown dynamics within a few observations. We demonstrate robots achieving complex manipulation tasks using the learned simulator, such as manipulating fluids and deformable foam, with experiments both in simulation and in the real world. Our study helps lay the foundation for robot learning of dynamic scenes with particle-based representations.

To do this, we will subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: 6*m + 30 - 30 = 0 - 30 6*m = -30 Step 4: Now, to get the value of m, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 6: 6*m / 6 = -30 / 6 m = -5 So, the solution for the equation 6*m + 32 - 2 = 0 is m = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Question: \\"How many AmerIndians were said to be living in the land of \\"land of wood and water\\" by the time Columbus arrived?\\" Answer: \\"200 Arawak sites\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Choose your answer from: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","completion":"Answer: [a]. no; Explanation: The answer \\"200 Arawak sites\\" is incorrect because the question asks for the number of AmerIndians living in the land, not the number of sites. The correct answer is mentioned in the paragraph: \\"when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island.\\" So, there were about 100,000 AmerIndians living in the land when Columbus arrived, not 200 Arawak sites."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - control computer - go on vacation - cross street - gain weight - separate things The answer to this question is:","completion":"'separate things'. When it comes to sorting out a pile of stuff, this task can be overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be a daunting exercise if you know how to proceed systematically. Here are some detailed steps the person might follow: 1. **Proper Assessment:** Before any sorting can start, it's crucial to take stock of what is in the pile. Depending on the type of stuff being sorted, whether it's documents, clothes, tools, or miscellaneous household items, you'll need to assess what categories can be created for sorting. This overview of the pile will guide the next step. 2. **Separate things:** In accordance with the options provided, the most suitable first active step is to separate things. Start with broad categories. For instance, if it's a pile of clothes, you might make piles for tops, bottoms, accessories, etc. If it's a pile of documents, separate them into piles for bills, letters, receipts, etc. 3. **Further Sort Within Each Category:** Once the larger categories are established, each category can be further sorted. Clothes could be sorted by season, color, type (casual, formal), or frequency of use. Documents could be sorted by year, subject, or importance. 4. **Decide What to Keep, Discard, Donate, or Sell:** As you sort, make rational decisions about what items are worth keeping. If something hasn't been used in a long time or is no longer needed, it might be better to discard or donate it, or even sell it if it has sufficient value. 5. **Organize and Store:** Once you've thoroughly sorted your pile of stuff, it's time to put everything away in their new locations. The key here is to keep similar items together and store them where you typically use them, so they're easy to find. 6. **Maintain Your System:** After the major task of sorting is done, the ongoing task of upkeep begins. As more stuff enters your life, sorting it immediately and putting it in its proper place will prevent the accumulation of another daunting pile. In conclusion, while the actual sorting process may vary depending on the items being sorted and personal preferences, the initial step is invariably to separate things. This creates a structure for additional sorting and organizing, and is the integral first step in making the task manageable."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Review: It would require the beauty and eloquence of Shakespeare to do justice to this outstanding cinematic feat. Nevertheless, I'll give it a go. As far as adaptations of Hamlet go this one is already at a better starting point than all other versions since it encompasses the entire play. Still this is no guarantee for a first-rate movie, or even a good one. Usually I'm not much for movies that are overlong and the trend that seems to be prevalent in Hollywood today, namely that movies should be at least two hours long, preferably three, is one that hopefully won't last long. Few stories are strong enough to withstand such extensive exploration and could do with some cutting. Making a four-hour-long movie and keeping it interesting is no small undertaking, but Kenneth Branagh pulls it off with flying colours. He has managed to make a very long movie seem no more than any average movie. I was completely engrossed from start to finish. The cast is excellent with Kenneth Branagh himself as the tormented prince giving a strong and memorable performance. He manages to convey his feelings admirably through his voice and one does not have to be an expert on Shakespearean verse to catch the myriad of emotions that are waging inside him. Kate Winslet was a positive surprise, I must say. I didn't know what to expect really. I've always liked her well enough as an actor, but wasn't sure she could pull off playing Shakespeare. Well, she certainly eradicated all doubts with her performance. She is the best Ophelia I have seen and lent such depth to the character and was simply wonderful. Other brilliant performances are Derek Jacobi as Claudius, Richard Briers as Polonius and Nicholas Farrell as Horatio to name but a few. I liked the fact that Branagh used some internationally more famous stars to play in some of the minor roles; I especially enjoyed the sparring between Hamlet and the gravedigger played by Billy Crystal. The setting of the play in the 19th century gives a welcome change to the usually gloomier Gothic settings. It is overall much lighter than other versions I've seen, more colourful and lavish, but this does not distract from the tragedy of the play. It is exceptional, stylish and aesthetically pleasing, a definite delight to the eye and other senses as well. The music by Patrick Doyle is as always magical and thoroughly in tune with the movie. One can only feel a deep sense of satisfaction after having seen this. I am shocked and appalled that this exquisite work of art did not win an Academy award for best picture, even more so that it wasn't even nominated. There is no way there was a better movie made that year, or any other year for that matter. This is as close to perfection as you can hope to get. To sum up, a stunning work of pure genius and I cannot see how anyone could top this. My hat's off to you Mr. Branagh. What is the sentiment of this review? Select from: [a]. negative.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. and the situation: John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization. Answer the following question: Would era B see higher or lower rate of weathering than era A? A:","completion":"Era B would see a lower rate of weathering than Era A, due to the decrease in rainfall. Less rain means that fewer rainwater passes through the soil, leading to fewer chemical reactions with the particles.

There were no art directors, no stylists, no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting. In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists. My story begins when I was in New York City for a speech, and my wife took a picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of the 57thand 5thavenue. We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture. Well you can see where this is going. Approaching my daughter's third birthday, my wife said, \\"Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ceremony?\\" This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture. So these photos are far more than representatives for a single moment, or even a specific trip.

Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community. For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world. Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help. Samake hasn't been to school, but she wants a better future for her five daughters, including Ramatou, 12, and Mariam, 10. \\"When a woman attends school, she will teach what she learns to her children,\\" said Ramatou, who wants to become a doctor. \\"She will also know how to take better care of her family.\\" Build On tries to build schools for grades one to three.

Sentence 2: During the Nagorno-Karabakh War he participated in military operations in Martakert , Askeran , Martuni , Aghdam and was wounded at least three times . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"These two sentences convey very similar information, but there are some slight differences between them. Both sentences communicate that the individual participated in military operations during a war and was wounded at least three times. The primary differences lie in the names of the war and the order of the locations mentioned. In Sentence 1, the war is referred to as the \\"mountain-Karabakh-war.\\" In Sentence 2, it is called the \\"Nagorno-Karabakh War.\\" While both names refer to the same conflict that took place between 1988 and 1994 in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, Sentence 2 uses the more commonly recognized name for the war. The order of the locations mentioned in the two sentences is also different. In Sentence 1, the locations are listed as Martuni, Askeran, Martakert, and Aghdam. In Sentence 2, they are listed as Martakert, Askeran, Martuni, and Aghdam. The order of locations may or may not be significant, depending on whether it is intended to convey the chronological order of the military operations or not.

If not, then these differences may be considered inconsequential, as the same locations are mentioned in both sentences, merely in different orders. In summary, the two sentences convey primarily the same information about the individual's participation in military operations during a war and being wounded multiple times.

Question: What is a defense mechanism of a mother bird? Context: Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays. Answer:","completion":"A defense mechanism of a mother bird is the mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The term \\"plate glass university\\" (or \\"plateglass university\\" or \\"plate-glass university\\") refers to a group of universities established or expanded in the United Kingdom during the mid-twentieth century. In 1963, the Robbins Report on higher education recommended a major expansion of the British university system, which was realised through the establishment of nine completely new universities and the conversion of the ten existing Colleges of Advanced Technology into full universities. While the Robbins Report was responsible for the broader policy that governed the early development of these institutions Lord Robbins was not responsible for most of the individual institutions as many applications for reclassification had already been accepted by the University Grants Committee in the later 1950s/early 1960s. - A cuisine (; from French , in turn from Latin \\"coquere\\" \\"to cook\\") is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques and dishes, and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region. A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Religious food laws, such as Hindu, Islamic and Jewish dietary laws, can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine. Regional food preparation traditions, customs and ingredients often combine to create dishes unique to a particular region. - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions. - A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. In the West, a modern residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, counters and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design. Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher and other electric appliances. The main function of a kitchen is serving as a location for storing, cooking and preparing food (and doing related tasks such as dishwashing), but it may also be used for dining, entertaining and laundry. - The disappearance of Claudia Lawrence is a missing person case concerning a then - 35 - year - old British chef at the University of York .

Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the band that is credited with pioneering Viking metal? ? Viking metal is a style of heavy metal music characterized by a lyrical and thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age. Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, to the point where some consider it more a cross-genre term than a genre, but it is typically seen as black metal with influences from Nordic folk music. Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both sung and harsh vocals, a reliance on folk instrumentation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect. Viking metal emerged from black metal during the late 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with black metal an opposition to Christianity, but rejecting Satanism and occult themes in favor of the Vikings and paganism. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and folk metal genres as part of broader modern Pagan and neo-völkisch movements as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities. Though artists such as Led Zeppelin, Yngwie Malmsteen, Heavy Load, and Manowar had previously dealt with Viking themes, Bathory from Sweden is generally credited with pioneering the style with its albums Blood Fire Death (1988) and Hammerheart (1990), which launched a renewed interest in the Viking Age among heavy metal musicians. Enslaved, from Norway, followed up on this burgeoning Viking trend with Hordanes Land (1993) and Vikingligr Veldi (1994). Burzum, Emperor, Einherjer, and Helheim, among others, helped further develop the genre in the early and mid-1990s.

News article: Good Friday is about to get better for publicans in the Republic of Ireland. Why? Because they can finally toast the Easter holiday with a pint. For almost a century, selling alcohol had been banned on Good Friday - a legacy of Ireland's Christian traditions. But in January 2018 the Irish parliament passed new legislation which means this year will be different. So what's the story for 2018? And who stands to gain from the change? What's different this year? Pubs in the Republic will welcome Easter revellers from 10:30 until closing time at 00:30. Off-licences may see some changes too, with fewer booze-desiring customers stocking up a day in advance. Good Friday is traditionally a popular time for house parties in the Republic, as friends and loved ones gather at home instead of the local boozer. But with the pub doors suddenly open, some may decide they'd rather skip the washing-up. It's good news for tourists seeking a tipple too. On Good Fridays past, hapless foreigners unaware of the drinks ban could be found wandering the streets of Dublin in a futile search for a pint. The most dedicated were even spotted boarding trains or ferries to exploit an infamous loophole - the on-board bar. Why did the law change? Easter is a busy tourist period, and the extra day's trade is set to boost the Irish economy. According to publicans' group the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI) - whose interest is clear - it could generate as much as 40m euros (£35m; 49m) in sales - plus 7m for the exchequer through VAT and excise duty. \\"The Good Friday ban is from a different era,\\" the group's chief executive, Padraig Cribben, said. \\"Like all other businesses who were never subject to a ban, publicans now have a choice to open.\\" ...but is everyone toasting the change? The Roman Catholic Church held considerable influence in the Republic historically, and some would still prefer an alcohol-free Friday on religious grounds. Back in January, critics said the altered legislation also undermined the government's goal of reducing the harm caused by alcohol. Independent TD (Irish member of parliament) Maureen O'Sullivan spoke frankly, asking: \\"Are we saying that the only tourists we want are those who can't last 24 hours without buying a drink in a public house?\\" \\"I actually think we could do with a few Good Fridays throughout the year,\\" she added. Perhaps mindful that not everyone approves of them opening, some hostelries have decided to give their Good Friday takings to charity. And in rural Newmarket, a little town in Cork, the six local publicans put their heads together - and agreed to keep their doors bolted. John Scanlon of Scanlon's Bar explained: \\"We have only two days off each year, Christmas Day and Good Friday, and we want to hold on to that. It is a day publicans want to spend with their families.\\" What about north of the border? In Northern Ireland pubs can open on Good Friday but may only serve alcohol between 17:00 and 23:00. The hospitality sector has called for the North to have the same options as the Republic. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, believes serving restrictions will cost the North's pubs and restaurants £20m in trade over the Easter weekend. What's your drinking nationality?

Nearby, the chatter of workers from the Victorian fruit and vegetable markets mixed with the sound of church bells wafts through the air as a key turns in the lock of Slattery’s pub and owner Brian Conlon pushes open the door. He sticks his head briefly outside and exchanges a few words with doorman Cristian Ichim before retreating to the cosy confines of his Capel Street pub. So far, the only customers on schedule for this historic 7am Good Friday opening are journalistic hacks, eagerly awaiting the Thursday night rollovers to begin streaming in. Pierce Bunch, Haley Wells, Bethany Ferraro, Lauren Thalheimer, Alexandra Kononenko, Faison Bunch, on a spring break from Maryland , Origan and New York, arrive at Slatterys Pub on Capel Street direct from the Airport to become some of the first customers to enjoy a pint on Good Friday. Photograph: Alan Betson/ The Irish Times The first arrival is far less conspicuous. Shane McShea is already digging into his breakfast and taking a sip of his first ever (legally poured) Good Friday pint when approached for a chat. He’s a regular to the pub and often stops by for a bite on his way to work. Asked if it feels special to be drinking in a pub on such a momentous day, he shrugs his shoulders. “It’s different but I never really thought about it before. It’s a good thing to see pubs open and I don’t think it’s going to cause any major issues towards alcoholism. Eventually I can see it just becoming like any Friday. I guess it’s a positive thing.” Outside on the street, Ichim stamps his feet to keep warm. After 11 years working the early morning security shift outside Slattery’s he’s fully accustomed to the early morning clientele.

Photograph: Alan Betson / The Irish Times “Mostly sober people,” he says. “People working night shifts who come in the morning like nurses, fireman and people working in the markets. Not many drunks or messers.” Pushed on this point, he admits he’s already turned away a few people who he felt were too drunk to enter. They have other options, he says pointing up the street towards another establishment where he says roll-overs can continue drinking. Slattery’s lit-up windows and open doors have already been met with disapproval by passers by this Good Friday morning, he adds. “They were older people saying it’s a disgrace and that it shouldn’t be happening. It’s one day a year. I think it’s very good for everyone; for staff it’s extra shifts, for tourists they have somewhere to go.” Pierce Bunch, Haley Wells, Bethany Ferraro, Lauren Thalheimer, Alexandra Kononenko, Faison Bunch, enjoy a pint on Good Friday morning. Photograph: Alan Betson/ The Irish Times Back inside, the Cranberries’ Zombie plays over the speakers as Stephen Foy from Palmerstown sits at the bar leafing through the morning paper while taking sips from his pint of Heineken. He’s arrived into town early to pick up fittings for a job later this morning. His plan is two pints, pick up the fittings and then off to work. Foy says the decision to allow pubs to open on Good Friday just makes sense. “They needed to get with the times. We’re not back a hundred years ago now.” Nearby, waitress Natalia Czarnik is laying tables for breakfast. She has worked the morning shifts at the early house for four years and says the early arrivals come to Slattery’s for the drink and stay for the food. “When the drinks start they begin to feel hungry but the main breakfast is the Guinness. It’s a mighty breakfast for everyone.” Most of the time, Czarnik enjoys chatting to the bleary-eyed all-nighters who fall through the door at 7am. “They’re usually very funny. Sometimes it’s hard to deal with them but we always have security.” Moments later, there’s a short commotion near the main entrance as six students with backpacks squeeze through the door. While they settle around a table near the blazing fire and order their pints, Faison Bunch explains how the group of friends from New York have arrived in Europe for a week-long trip around Ireland and the UK. They began their morning in McDonalds - following a 5am flight arrival - but then they heard the pubs were open. “We were just trying to find a place to go and I’m thinking when is the soonest we can drink a Guinness,” says Bunch. “Then we found Slattery’s was opening so it was like guys, let’s do it.” “We were in the cab on the way here and the guy driving us was like this is a big deal,” he adds before taking his first sip of Guinness. “We’re making history. So I guess this really is a good Friday.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"For the first time in almost a century, pubs in the Republic of Ireland opened their doors to customers on Good Friday in 2018.

Here are possible answers to this question: - relaxation - get arrested - wealth increases - losing money - pleasure I believe the correct choice is \\"losing money\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Losing money.\\" When you purchase beer at a store, you are essentially exchanging a portion of your wealth (money) for the beer. In the process of making this transaction, you are reducing the amount of money you have, which means your wealth – assuming wealth is measured solely in terms of money – decreases as a result of the purchase. Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean your overall satisfaction or enjoyment of life will decrease as a result of the purchase. Some of the other options you listed, such as relaxation and pleasure, could be personal benefits that you may experience from buying and consuming the beer. It's important to note that these benefits may be perceived as intangible or non-monetary increases in your overall sense of well-being, but they do not increase your actual financial wealth. As for the options of getting arrested and wealth increases, these do not accurately describe the immediate impact of buying beer at a store. Getting arrested would be an unlikely outcome unless you were breaking the law in some way, such as attempting to buy beer while underage, and wealth increases is the opposite of what would actually happen to your monetary wealth during the purchase. In summary, when buying beer at the store, your wealth (in terms of money) decreases because you are spending money to acquire the product. While you might gain intangible benefits like relaxation and pleasure, these are not considered increases in your financial wealth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Canaan (Northwest Semitic: \\"\\"; Phoenician: ; Biblical Hebrew/ Masoretic: [\\"; nan]\\") was a Semitic-speaking region in the Ancient Near East during the late 2nd millennium BC. In the Bible it corresponds to the Levant, in particular to the areas of the Southern Levant that provide the main setting of the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, i.e., the area of Israel, Philistia, Phoenicia, and other nations. - Tell Ashtara ( Arabic : ) also Aštartu , was a site south of Damascus mentioned in the Amarna letters correspondence of 1350 BC. In the Amarna letters the city is named Aštartu , and is usually identified with the Biblical ' Ashteroth Karnaim ' . Aštartu is only referenced in two letters of the 382 letter corpus , in letters EA 256 , and EA 197 : ( titled : \`\` Biryawaza 's plight '' ) , - ( EA is for ' el Amarna ' ) . Biryawaza was the mayor of Damascus - called Dimasqu . EA 256 is a story concerning Mutbaal , the son of Labaya , and the Habiru , and concerns the whereabouts of Ayyab , who may be in Pihilu , modern day Pella , Jordan , and is a letter of intrigue , titled : \`\` Oaths and denials '' , and lists 7 cities located in the Golan area . Ayyab is the king of Aštartu and does author one letter to the Egyptian pharaoh , letter EA 364 . - Ashteroth Karnaim was a city in the land of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, mentioned in and (where it is rendered simply as \\"Ashteroth\\"). The name translates literally to 'Ashteroth of the Horns', with 'Ashteroth' being a Canaanite fertility goddess, and 'horns' being symbolic of mountain peaks. It is possibly the same as Carnaim in First Maccabees and Carnion in Second Maccabees. - Upper Egypt (', shortened to ' ) is the strip of land on both sides of the Nile that extends between Nubia and downriver (northwards) to Lower Egypt. - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - Damascus (' ) is the capital and likely the largest city of Syria, following the decline in population of Aleppo due to the ongoing battle for the city. It is commonly known in Syria as \\"ash-Sham\\" (') and nicknamed as the \\"City of Jasmine\\" (\\"\\"). In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious centre of the Levant. The city has an estimated population of 1,711,000 . - Aleppo (/ ALA-LC: \\"\\") is a city in Syria, serving as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous Syrian governorate. With an official population of 2,132,100 (2004 census), Aleppo was the largest Syrian city before the Syrian Civil War; however, now Aleppo is likely the second-largest city in Syria after the capital Damascus. - Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150) until the Macedonian conquest in 305 BC, although the actual term \\"Pharaoh\\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until circa 1200 BCE. - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. - The Jordan River (also River Jordan; \\"Nahar ha-Yarden\\"; \\"Nahr al-Urdun\\", Ancient Greek: , \\"Iordànes\\") is a -long river in the Middle East that flows roughly north to south through the Sea of Galilee and on to the Dead Sea. Israel and the West Bank border the river to the west, while the Golan Heights and Jordan lie to its east. Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river. - The Amarna letters (sometimes referred to as the Amarna correspondence or Amarna tablets) are an archive, written on clay tablets, primarily consisting of diplomatic correspondence between the Egyptian administration and its representatives in Canaan and Amurru during the New Kingdom. The letters were found in Upper Egypt at Amarna, the modern name for the ancient Egyptian capital of \\"Akhetaten\\" (el-Amarna), founded by pharaoh Akhenaten (1350s 1330s BC) during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt. The Amarna letters are unusual in Egyptological research, because they are mostly written in Akkadian cuneiform, the writing system of ancient Mesopotamia, rather than that of ancient Egypt. The known tablets total 382: 24 tablets had been recovered since the Norwegian Assyriologist Jørgen Alexander Knudtzon's landmark edition of the Amarna letters, \\"Die El-Amarna-Tafel\\", published in two volumes (1907 and 1915). The written correspondence spans a period of at most thirty years. - Bashan (\\"ha-Bashan\\"; or Basanitis) is a biblical place first mentioned in , where it is said that King Chedorlaomer and his confederates \\"smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth\\", where Og the king of Bashan had his residence. At the time of the Israelites entrance into the Promised Land, Og came out against them, but was utterly routed. Bashan extended from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and from the Jordan river on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with the half of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh. Golan, one of its cities, became a Levitical city and a city of refuge. - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus. - Amarna is an extensive Egyptian archaeological site that represents the remains of the capital city newly established and built by the Pharaoh Akhenaten of the late Eighteenth Dynasty, and abandoned shortly after his death (1332 BC). The name for the city employed by the ancient Egyptians is written as Akhetaten (or Akhetatontransliterations vary) in English transliteration. Akhetaten means \\"Horizon of the Aten\\". - Aten (also Aton, Egyptian \\"jtn\\") is the disk of the sun in ancient Egyptian mythology, and originally an aspect of the god Ra. The deified Aten is the focus of the religion of Atenism established by Amenhotep IV, who later took the name Akhenaten (died ca. 1335 BCE) in worship and recognition of Aten. In his poem \\"Great Hymn to the Aten\\", Akhenaten praises Aten as the creator, giver of life, and nurturing spirit of the world. Aten does not have a Creation Myth or family, but is mentioned in the Book of the Dead. The worship of Aten was eradicated by Horemheb. What is the relationship between 'tell ashtara' and 'syria'? A:","completion":"Tell Ashtara is an archaeological site in modern-day Syria, located south of Damascus. It has historical significance as it is mentioned in the Amarna letters, a collection of diplomatic correspondence between the Egyptian administration and its representatives in Canaan and Amurru during the New Kingdom.

Based on the premise \\"For example, one point that is sometimes overlooked is that low personal saving has consequences for U.S. reliance on foreign borrowing, long-term economic growth, and standards of living for future generations.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"That low personal saving has no consequences for U.S\\" is true (see options)? OPTIONS: -yes; -it is not possible to tell; -no;","completion":"The hypothesis \\"That low personal saving has no consequences for U.S\\" is not validated by the premise provided. The premise states that low personal saving does indeed have consequences for the United States, specifically in terms of its reliance on foreign borrowing, long-term economic growth, and standards of living for future generations. Therefore, the correct option from those provided would be \\"-no;\\" It is important to understand why the premise undermines this hypothesis. Firstly, the premise makes it clear that low levels of personal saving increase U.S reliance on foreign borrowing. Simply put, when the citizens of a country save money, it adds to the nation’s capital available for investments. If, as individuals, people save less, it can lead to a deficit, forcing the country to rely more on foreign borrowing to make up for the deficit. This international borrowing might meet present financial demands but can lead to a bigger interest repayment in the future. Secondly, the premise also hints towards long-term economic growth which is directly influenced by personal savings. Savings are a major part of any nation's investment capital. When the personal savings rate is higher, the pool of money available for businesses to use to improve productivity, innovate or expand operations is correspondingly larger. Lower levels of saving, therefore, mean less money is available for these productive business investments, which can limit economic growth or even cause the economy to contract over time. Lastly, it is indicated that savings also affect the standard of living for future generations. If the previous generations do not save, then the future generations might have to face an increased tax and interest rate burden induced by the reimbursement of foreign debt. This could cause a fall in their real income, ultimately affecting the standard of living negatively. In conclusion, it can be seen that if personal savings are low, it has a multitude of consequences on various aspects of a country's economy and the living standards of its citizens. Therefore, the hypothesis that low personal savings have no consequences for the U.S. is not true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here are the definitions of logical operators: 1. count: returns the number of rows in the view. 2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view. 3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row. 4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments. 5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column. 6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column. 7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column. 8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column. 9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal. 10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance. 11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument. 12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments. 13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument. 14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument. 15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument. 16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table 17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. 18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. 19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. 20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. 21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. 22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. Problem:Command: eq { count { filter_eq { all_rows ; competition ; friendly } } ; 4 }, interpretation: select the rows whose competition record fuzzily matches to friendly . the number of such rows is 4 . Solution:","completion":"Part #1: filter_eq { all_rows ; competition ; friendly } Usage: Select the rows where the \\"competition\\" column value is equal to \\"friendly\\" Example: If a table has 5 rows, and 3 of them have \\"friendly\\" in the \\"competition\\" column, filter_eq will select those 3 rows. The interpretation is appropriate, as it selects only the rows that match the \\"friendly\\" value. Part #2: count { filter_eq { all_rows ; competition ; friendly } } Usage: Count the number of rows selected by the filter_eq operation. Example: Continuing the previous example, count will return the number of rows where \\"competition\\" is equal to \\"friendly\\". In this case, count will return 3. Part #3: eq { count { filter_eq { all_rows ; competition ; friendly } } ; 4 } Usage: Check if the count returned by the filter_eq operation is equal to 4. Example: Using the previous examples, eq will compare the count of rows where \\"competition\\" is equal to \\"friendly\\" (3 in our example) to the given value 4. Since 3 is not equal to 4, eq will return \\"no\\" as the interpretation is not appropriate to meet the criteria of 4 rows with \\"friendly\\" competition."},{"prompt":"Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"What protects crops from being eaten?\\" and the following answer choices: - Bright sunlight - Pesticides - Over watering - fur and fat - energy barrier - layers of fat - exoskeleton - Dry soil Now knowing that apesticide is used for protecting plants by killing insects and insects eat our crops, choose the best answer.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who claims \\"I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland\\"? is inside the article: Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

An extremely rare fossil of footprints made more than 300million years ago has been discovered by a 10-year-old schoolboy. Bruno Debattista, a pupil at Windmill Primary School in Oxford, brought a piece of shale with what he thought might be a fossilised imprint to the after-school club at Oxford University's Museum of Natural History. Astonished museum experts found it appeared to contain trackways left by a horseshoe crab crawling up the muddy slopes of an ancient shore around 320million years ago.

Well spotted: A close-up view shows the faint tracks on the piece of slate. Chris Jarvis, education officer at the Museum, said: ‘Footprints of this age are incredibly rare and extremely hard to spot, so we were amazed when Bruno produced them at our After-School Club. Bruno poses with a preserved horseshoe crab: The 10-year-old collected the fossil while on holiday in Cornwall last summer. 'Still more impressive is the fact that. Bruno had a hunch they might be some kind of footprints, even though the. specimen had some of our world expert geologists arguing about it over. their microscopes!' Bruno’s fossil has been confirmed by the Museum as likely showing footprints of a pair of mating horseshoe crabs laid down during the Carboniferous period, some 308-327million years ago. At this time, the sea was slowly being sealed off as the Earth’s landmasses crunched together to form Pangaea. The museum's Natural History After-School Club encourages Year 6 children to develop their interest in the natural world. It is hopes that some might become the next generation of geologists and zoologists. The club’s weekly sessions look at rocks, fossils, insects and other animal life. Members are encouraged to make observations and collect specimens to be shared each week. Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans, but are more closely related to spiders and scorpions than lobsters and shrimp. They are one of the world's oldest species, with the earliest fossils found in strata from the late Ordovician period, roughly 450 million years ago. They live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms, but will occasionally come on shore for mating. They are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer, and in recent years, habitat destruction and over-harvesting has led to a decline in numbers. Bruno was specially selected for the club by his teachers, after showing a particular interest in nature. He collected the fossil while on holiday in Cornwall last summer. ‘Unfortunately, the excitement and motivation that many children instinctively feel for studying nature is often lost during their teenage years as it is seen as 'uncool' or a bit 'weird', and science can become text-book oriented and exam-driven during secondary school,’ Mr Jarvis said. ‘The club is our attempt to encourage children to value and extend their skills and knowledge and to follow their interests. 'I hope it is helping to create a group of kids that will continue to share their interests into their teenage years and beyond.’ Bruno and his family have decided to donate the fossil specimen to the Museum’s collection.

Paragraph: Though prehistoric remains from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages have been unearthed in the Manzanares Valley, prior to Madrid's sudden elevation to capital city in 1561 its history was rather undistinguished. Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477.

News article: General Motors CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday she wants to find out if GM engineering employees executed a coverup or were merely incompetent in failing to recall a defective part linked to 13 deaths. In testimony before a House Energy and Commerce Committee panel investigating why the automaker waited years to fix the vehicles, Barra said she has asked former U.S. attorney Anton “Tony” Valukas to help figure that out. Previously Valukas investigated the collapse of the Lehman Bros. financial services firm in 2008. Barra also issued yet another apology for GM's failure to fix the problem years earlier. She conceded that company officials knew of issues with the faulty ignition switches behind the crashes and deaths for more than a decade. Barra said she found the automaker's worries about the cost to fix defective cars \\"disturbing.\\" Those concerns were detailed in documents obtained by the House committee. “That is not acceptable,” Barra said. “Today, if there is safety issue ... if we know that there is a safety defect on our vehicles, we don’t look at the cost but at the speed at which we can fix the problem.” Barra’s apologies notwithstanding, GM legally shed responsibility for crashes before the automaker's 2009 bankruptcy and federal bailout. The restructuring created a new company, which bought the assets of the old GM, but allowed it to shed its debts and legal liabilities. But Barra, in more than two hours of testimony, hinted GM might compensate victims and their families in connection with recall-related accidents that took place before the bankruptcy. \\"We do understand we have civic responsibilities as well as legal responsibilities,\\" she said when asked about how the company would handle pre-bankruptcy crashes. Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) asked if GM purposely withheld information about problems with the ignition switch and other safety issues when it was negotiating the terms of its bankruptcy and federal bailout in 2009. Barra said she was not aware of any effort to hide information about potential liabilities, “but I can’t speak to every single person.” Barra said the company has hired Kenneth Feinberg as a consultant to explore and evaluate options for the families of victims of accidents caused by the defective part. “Mr. Feinberg is highly qualified, and is very experienced in the handling of matters such as this,” Barra said. “He brings expertise and objectivity to this effort, and will help us evaluate the situation and recommend the best path forward.” Feinberg has previously handled compensation issues for victims of 9/11, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the Boston Marathon bombings. “My mandate from the company is to consider the options for dealing with issues surrounding the ignition switch matter, and to do so in an independent, balanced and objective manner, based upon my prior experience,” Feinberg said. Barra also told the panel that the automaker made “mistakes” in not recalling vehicles with a deadly flaw years ago. Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) an industrial engineer, asked Barra why the company used an ignition switch that did not meet company specifications. “Why in the world would a company with the stellar reputation of General Motors purchase a part that did not meet its own specifications?” he said. Barra responded: “I want to know that as much as you do.” When pressed on whether GM now would purchase parts that don’t meet specifications in the future, Barra said in some cases they do if the part meets safety, functionality and durability standards among others. Barton called that answer “gobbledygook.” “That’s not an acceptable answer for the American people,” he said. “There shouldn’t be a part used in any GM product ... that doesn’t meet the specifications.” Although it knew about the problem as far back as 2001, GM only in the last two months has recalled 2.6 million vehicles to replace the defective ignition switch, which is now linked to 13 deaths. The switch can unintentionally turn off the vehicle and disable its airbags. GM faces investigations from the NHTSA and the Justice Department into why it did not recall the vehicles sooner. Barra is to be joined before the committee by David J. Friedman, the acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Lawmakers are set to quiz Friedman about why the safety agency didn’t force GM to recall the vehicles earlier. Documents show that the NHTSA was aware of the problem. In his written testimony, Friedman said GM had failed to provide regulators “critical information” that could have triggered recalls years earlier. Only recently did GM provide “new evidence” that made it clear that the ignition problem could disable air bags, he said. Meanwhile, families of victims of fatal crashes of the GM compact cars in question on Tuesday sharply criticized the automaker for delays in recalling the vehicles and called for legislation to prevent a repeat of the situation. About two dozen family members gathered in front of the Capitol to make their case before Barra and Friedman testified. The families were joined by four Democratic lawmakers who want to toughen laws governing the disclosure of auto defects. [For The Record, 5:46 p.m. PDT April 1: An earlier version of this post stated that Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) asked if GM purposely withheld information about problems with an ignition switch and other safety issues when it was negotiating the terms of its bankruptcy and federal bailout in 2009. The question was asked by Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.)

ADVERTISEMENT GM CEO Mary Barra, testifying before Congress for the first time since taking the helm in January, expressed remorse to the people in the hearing room who lost family members in crashes linked to the defect.\\"Today's GM will do the right thing. That begins with my sincere apologies to everyone who has been affected by this recall, especially the families and friends who lost their lives or were injured. I am deeply sorry,\\" Barra said.Lawmakers pressed Barra to explain why it took so long for GM to address the problem with the vehicles, which rolled off assembly lines in the mid-2000s but were not recalled until earlier this year.“GM knew about this problem in 2001,” said Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.). “They were warned again and again over the next decade, but they did nothing.”DeGette held up an ignition switch with keys hanging from it to illustrate how easily the ignition in the vehicles could be cut.“If you had a heavy key chain like my mom, or … if you were short and you bumped up against the ignition with your knee, it could cause this key to switch right off,” DeGette said, adding that the problem was caused by a spring that costs “pennies.”Thirteen deaths have been linked to the ignition switch problem. Relatives of those victims were in attendance during Tuesday’s hearing and, earlier in the day, ripped the auto company during a press conference outside the Capitol.“Our daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, wives and husbands are gone because they were a cost of doing business GM style,” said Maryland resident Laura Christian, whose daughter Amber Marie Rose was killed in a 2005 accident, while she was driving a Chevrolet Cobalt.Christian said GM executives “made a decision that ‘fighting’ the problem was cheaper and easier than ‘fixing’ the problem.”Barra took pains to distance herself from decisions that were made at the auto company before she took over as chief executive.\\"This is an extraordinary situation. It involves vehicles we no longer make, but it came to light on my watch, so I'm responsible for resolving it,” Barra told the panel. “When we have answers, we will be fully transparent with you, with our regulators and with our customers.”Lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee were hardly in a forgiving mood. Representatives in both parties repeatedly pressed Barra to explain why the recall took so long and said complaints about the ignition switch started coming in almost as soon as many of the models hit the roadways. “As soon as the Chevy Cobalt rolled off the production line in 2004, customers began filing complaints about the ignition switch,” said Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), the chairman of the subpanel. “According to GM's public statements, it wasn't until December 2013 the company finally put the pieces together and linked the problems with the airbags with the faulty ignition switch almost 10 years after customers first told GM the Cobalt ignition switch didn't work,” Murphy said. Murphy also questioned why regulators at the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) didn’t order the recall right away. “The red flags were there for GM and NHTSA to take action, but for some reason, it did not happen. Why didn't GM and NHTSA put the pieces together for 10 years? Why didn't anyone ask the critical, important questions? Why did GM accept parts below their own company standards and specs?” Barra was pressed about specific dates and times of GM’s actions involving the recalled cars, and appeared to get flustered, when lawmakers asked her to defend actions that occurred before her tenure as CEO. “Clearly, there were a lot of things that happened,” she said. “There's been a lot of statements made as it relates. That's why we've hired [attorney] Anton Valukas to do a complete investigation of this process. We are spanning over a decade of time.” Barra’s attempt to distance herself from her predecessors at GM was met with skepticism. “You are the company right now,” Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said. Barra attempted to stick to her forward-looking focus and told lawmakers said was determined to fix the damage done to the company and its customers. She said GM has hired Washington attorney Ken Feinberg to be a consultant on the company’s response to the recall. Feinberg is a specialist in corporate crisis compensation payments, having overseen payments to families of victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; the 2007 Virginia Tech University mass shooting and the 2010 BP oil spill. Barr said she has told GM employees that “getting the cars repaired is only the first step” and is urging them to focus on being responsive to drivers of the recalled vehicles who are looking for repairs. “Giving customers the best service possible is how we will be judged,” Barra said. ||||| During her opening statement, General Motors chief executive Mary Barra said that she does not know why it took years for the carmaker to announce a safety defect but she that she is committed to finding out. (The Associated Press) During her opening statement, General Motors chief executive Mary Barra said that she does not know why it took years for the carmaker to announce a safety defect but she that she is committed to finding out. (The Associated Press) General Motors chief executive Mary T. Barra on Tuesday deflected a barrage of questions on Capitol Hill about the automaker’s failure to fix a deadly ignition-switch flaw, telling lawmakers that she was unaware of the decade-old problem until early this year. While she repeatedly apologized for a defect that GM has blamed for the deaths of at least 13 motorists, Barra also repeatedly ducked lawmakers’ sometimes testy queries, saying she is awaiting the results of an internal investigation. A GM lifer who became the company’s top executive in mid-January, Barra took pains to make a distinction between the cost-conscious “old GM” — which, she admitted, missed a series of red flags and may have engineered a coverup — and the post-bankruptcy “new GM,” which Barra said is focused on customer safety. “I cannot tell you why it took years for a safety defect to be announced,” Barra told a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigative panel. “I can tell you that we will find out.” In her opening statement, Barra announced that Kenneth Feinberg, the lawyer who has helped mete out payments to victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and to victims of BP’s Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010, had been hired by GM to “explore and evaluate options in its response to families of accident victims.” Prior to a House committee hearing with the chief executive of General Motors, lawmakers and families of victims killed in crashes involving GM cars held a news conference. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) The move suggests that GM expects to face additional claims on behalf of people killed or injured in the recalled vehicles. Feinberg said Barra has asked him to examine options for compensating victims of the defect, which could include a broad settlement fund. “Over the next 60 days, we hope to propose some objective claims-resolution approach that meets the needs of the victims, the company and the public interest,” Feinberg said in an interview. GM has recalled 2.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts and other small vehicles because of the faulty switches. Lawmakers said GM could have fixed the defective switch for as little as 57 cents per vehicle. Still, the automaker waited more than a decade to issue a recall, despite mounting evidence of a problem, including 133 complaints to dealers and numerous legal settlements paid to families of people who perished in related accidents. Barra’s testimony seemed to do little to mollify lawmakers, many of whom appeared to have scoured the thousands of pages of documents the company submitted to congressional investigators. One after another, they grilled her about questionable company decisions, such as installing switches that did not meet GM’s technical specifications and quietly approving a new switch design in 2006 without assigning a new part number or initiating a recall. “Ms. Barra, I know this isn’t the most enjoyable situation for you. But we’re in a situation where we don’t trust the company right now,” said Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.). The panel also heard from David Friedman, the acting head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which also failed for years to recognize the problem. Friedman pointed the finger at GM for not providing regulators with timely information that could have led federal regulators to order a recall. “Our ability to find defects also requires automakers to act in good faith and on time,” Friedman said. View Graphic A history of GM’s ignition problems Asked by Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) whether GM had acted in good faith, Friedman said NHTSA has opened an investigation “to answer that exact question. And if we find they were not, we will hold them accountable.” But lawmakers were also interested in NHTSA’s failures, demanding to know why the agency did not take action to determine why air bags in the Cobalt failed to deploy in a series of accidents — and to demand that GM remedy the problem. Friedman defended the agency, saying it had compared the Cobalt’s track record with other vehicles and found no consistent trend. “When it came to [air bag] non-deployments, Cobalt was not an outlier,” he said. Moreover, NHTSA investigators looking into specific crashes were not convinced that the air bags failed to deploy because of a faulty ignition switch. At the time, Friedman said, the idea that the switch could be jostled, flip to the “accessory” position and disable power steering, brakes and critical electronics, including air bags, was “one theory.” “But in the crashes we looked at, investigators thought it was more likely that the air bag did not deploy because of the circumstances of the crash,” Friedman said. “I know it looks like it should have been clear,” he added. “But it’s clear now in part because we have that clear connection from GM.” The hearing took place in a room packed with observers, including the family members of people who died in the recalled vehicles. Photos of about a dozen crash victims — smiling young women, a Marine in his dress blues — were propped on a ledge at the back of the room. Barra, who held a tearful meeting Monday night in GM’s Washington offices with nearly two dozen family members of crash victims, expressed her “sincere apologies to everyone who has been affected by this recall . . . especially to the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured. I am deeply sorry.” She was less forthcoming about other matters. Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), the chairman of the subcommittee conducting the hearing, noted that GM had missed evidence of the defect for more than a decade. Citing documents submitted by GM, Murphy listed nearly a dozen specific instances where he said GM — or federal regulators — should have taken action. “Why didn’t GM and NHTSA put the pieces together for 10 years? Why didn’t anyone ask the critically important questions?” Murphy said. “To borrow a phrase, what we have here is a failure to communicate — and the results are deadly.” Barra said she found “very disturbing” a statement made by a GM official who in 2005 rejected a proposed fix for the flawed switch because it was not cost- effective. “That is not how we do business at today’s GM,” she said. Throughout nearly two hours of testimony, Barra remained even-tempered and contrite. But she was also tight-lipped and, at times, evasive. Asked how often the automaker uses parts that do not match its specifications, Barra said the company always aims to use parts that are safe and reliable. Parts that do not meet technical requirements, she said, are not necessarily defective. “What you just answered is gobbledygook,” shot back Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.). Later, after Barra had left the hearing room and been replaced at the witness table by Friedman, Barton summed up lawmakers’ reaction to her performance. “I think it’s obvious,” he said, “that GM has some real questions that they’ve not done a very good job answering today.” ||||| Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Members of Congress on Tuesday pressed General Motors CEO Mary Barra on why apparently glaring signals over the years failed to prompt an earlier recall of potentially deadly cars. VPC Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, arrives to testify before the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations during a hearing investigating the GM ignition switch recall in Washington. (Photo: H. Darr Beiser, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON — In what already could be a turning point in her fledgling reign, General Motors CEO Mary Barra on Tuesday battled a congressional subcommittee that wanted far more information about GM's fatal ignition-switch foul-ups than she was able to provide. She was battered for speaking \\"gobbledygook,\\" thumped for not firing an engineer who apparently concealed a change to the potentially deadly switches, and blasted because GM made an economic decision to keep the flawed component in production while knowing it didn't meet GM standards. Barra, who has been CEO for less than three months, fielded questions from the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee for two hours, avoiding any obvious gaffes and keeping her cool but also largely ducking specific answers, saying an internal investigation is underway into why it took GM so long to address ignition-switch problems first detected in 2001 this year. Representatives kept demanding \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" answers right now, while Barra, an engineer, wanted to explain. Nor could they fathom how the CEO of a company couldn't just find things out, while Barra said she shouldn't meddle in the internal investigation already underway by former U.S. attorney Anton Valukas. She also announced that she is bringing in another outsider, a compensation expert, to help it sort out GM's response to consumers affected by the defect linked to 13 deaths: Ken Feinberg, an attorney who led victim compensation efforts in the World Trade Center attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the BP Gulf Coast oil spill and the Boston Marathon bombing. Families of those losing their lives have asked that a victims fund be established. GM has remained silent on that subject but Barra said Feinberg will help \\"assess the appropriate next step.\\" Barra told the panel looking into the recall of more than 2.53 million vehicles that the company has moved away from a \\"cost culture\\" to a more customer-friendly one. \\"You talk about a new culture. Has anybody been held accountable?\\" demanded member Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La. Barra said nobody has been fired or disciplined as a result of involvement in the switch fiasco, as far as she knows, but that could change when the investigation is finished. Even then, she said, \\"we will share what's appropriate\\" and not necessarily the whole internal GM report. This irritated some committee members. Some implied that GM might have concealed information about the problem-plagued switch to avoid carrying forward responsibility for damage, injuries and deaths caused by the switch into the \\"new GM\\" formed July 2009 after the car company's bankruptcy reorganization. Barra seemed to suggest it was possible that happened: \\"I did not personally withhold anything. I can't speak to every single person.\\" Asked about a report indicating that GM considered a fix in response to problems in 2004 because of the \\"lead time required, cost and effectiveness,\\" Barra said she \\"found that statement to be very disturbing\\" and called it \\"unacceptable. That is not how we do business in today's GM.\\" \\"It's not acceptable to put a cost on a safety issue,\\" she later added under questioning. With Barra facing the glare of a congressional investigation for the first time, however — and with the company's resurgent post-bankruptcy profits and reputation on the line — there was still little she could tell members to explain why it took GM more than a decade to link ignition switch issues with air bag deployment. Over the past two months, the company has recalled millions of Chevrolet Cobalts and HHRs, Saturn Ions and Skys and Pontiac G5s and Solstices, saying the ignition switch could inadvertently be jostled out of position, potentially disabling the air bags in the event of a crash. JAIL TIME? Key questions GM faces STORY: Loved ones of crash victims speak out The acting head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, David Friedman, was called to testify as well and said his agency missed the link, too, despite hundreds of complaints. Friedman, however, said the agency could have taken a closer look at the relationship between the ignition switches and air bag deployment if GM had shared more information with it. Friedman said NHTSA considered investigating non-deployment in Chevrolet Cobalts and Saturn Ions in 2007 and in 2010 but that no discernible pattern was indicated. Neither car, he said, \\"stood out when compared to other vehicles.\\" \\"We applied expertise, we applied understanding,\\" Friedman said. \\"I wish the connection was as direct as we now know it is.\\" U.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said Congress may need to make changes to ensure NHTSA considers a greater range of data and several legislators are talking about strengthening reporting rules for automakers in the wake of the recall. \\"It appears we have a flaw in NHTSA's decision-making process,\\" Dingell said. Barra and Friedman testify again Wednesday morning on the recall before a Senate subcommittee. Rosie Cortinas, whose 23-year-old son Amador, of Caldwell, Idaho, died in a Cobalt crash five months ago, said she was frustrated with how the hearing went, believing Barra was holding back. \\"I have to keep walking out,\\" she said, wiping a tear from an eye. \\"I feel like there is some kind of inhumanity in this room. They aren't looking at it as a human point of view. They are looking at it from a company's point of view.\\" Committee members didn't appear to pull any punches and hammered away at Barra on information that the supplier of the switch, Michigan-based Delphi, told GM as early as 2002 that the switches did not meet the company's specifications yet it still accepted them. \\"Why in the world would a company (like GM) purchase a part that did not meet its own specifications?\\" asked Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas. \\"I want to know that as much as you do,\\" Barra responded, saying that it's part of the internal investigation but that she couldn't answer the question right now. \\"It's not how we do business today.\\" During another part of her testimony, however, Barra suggested that there are circumstances where even if a part or product is substandard it doesn't mean that it's defective. Barton called this answer \\"gobbledygook.\\" Members also questioned why an engineer at the company, identified in documents released by the committee from Delphi as Ray DeGiorgio, signed off on a change in 2006 to the ignition switch, apparently without the knowledge of others at GM. Another document from 2005 provided to the committee showed consideration of a change to the part but noted concerns over the cost — adding about 90 cents to the price of the switch. Barra indicated that if the company had recalled all the switches in 2007, it would have cost the company less than 100 million. But there were clear indications that while a change was made to the part, \\"it appears there was information at one part of the company and another part of the company didn't have access to that,\\" she said. While much of the questioning was polite, it was also dogged. Members of both parties continued to ask how GM — which knew there were issues with ignition switches as early as 2001 during preproduction of the Saturn Ion and approved the change to those switches in 2006 — could have missed so many warning signs for a recall. \\"Documents produced to the committee show that both NHTSA and GM received complaints and data about problems with ignition switches and air bags. The complaints go back at least 10 years,\\" said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who chairs the full House Energy and Commerce Committee. \\"A small spring inside the switch — a piece that cost pennies — failed to provide enough force, causing the switch to turn off when the car went over a bump,\\" added Rep. Diana DeGette, of Colorado, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee. \\"GM knew about this problem in 2001. They were warned again and again over the next decade but did nothing.\\" Earlier in the day, the families of people who lost loved ones in crashes involving the recalled vehicles held a news conference, asking that GM take all the cars off the road until they are fixed; GM has said they are safe to operate as long as drivers take all the weight off the keychain. The company has also agreed to provide loaners if drivers are nervous about the vehicles. To date, some 13,000 loaners have been provided, Barra said. New parts are supposed to become available this month with Delphi expected to add a third shift at a Mexican facility to produce them. But committee members said they still have concerns, especially because Delphi officials told staff investigators that even after the 2006 change, the parts did not meet specifications. Feinberg, meanwhile, could help the company determine what to do regarding potential claimants. GM is generally protected from liability claims for incidents before it went through bankruptcy in July 2009. That protection, however, could be limited if it can be shown GM officials knowingly hid the defects. Families of those losing their lives have asked that a victims fund be established. GM has remained silent on that subject but Barra said Feinberg will help \\"assess the appropriate next step.\\" \\"We understand we have civic responsibilities as well as legal responsibilities,\\" she said. GM expects to meet with Feinberg on Friday and expect it will take 30 to 60 days for him to report back. \\"We're going to work very hard to do the right thing for our customers.\\" Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., the chairman of the subcommittee, asked pointedly whether there was \\"culture\\" at GM before the bankruptcy that \\"would put cost over safety.\\" Barra — a veteran of GM — said the company \\"moved from a cost culture after the bankruptcy to a customer culture.\\" GM has recalled 7 million vehicles worldwide since the beginning of the year. \\"I know you're taking this job at an inauspicious time,\\" said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., \\"You're trying to clean up the mess your predecessors left for you.\\" Spangler reports for the Detroit Free Press.

The law does not regulate how much individuals can contribute to their own campaigns , a decided advantage for millionaires such as Schwarzenegger and Ueberroth . Do they have the same meaning?","completion":"To determine whether these two sentences have the same meaning, I will analyze each sentence and compare their structures and elements. 1. Sentence Structure and Elements - Both sentences contain the main clause \\"The law does not regulate how much individuals can contribute to their own campaigns\\". - In both sentences, the advantage of this situation is described as \\"a decided advantage for millionaires\\". - In the first sentence, \\"like Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. Ueberroth\\" is used, while in the second sentence, \\"such as Schwarzenegger and Ueberroth\\" is used. 2. Comparison - The main difference between the two sentences is the use of \\"like\\" vs. \\"such as\\" and the use of \\"Mr.\\" as a title for the mentioned individuals. - \\"Like\\" and \\"such as\\" can be considered synonyms in this context and serve to provide examples of millionaires who benefit from the unregulated campaign contributions. - The use of \\"Mr.\\" as a title in the first sentence adds a more formal emphasis on the individuals mentioned, while omitting it in the second sentence makes it less formal. Conclusion: The two sentences have very similar meanings. They both convey that the law does not regulate how much individuals can contribute to their own campaigns, and this situation provides a decided advantage for millionaires, exemplified by Schwarzenegger and Ueberroth. The difference in formality created by the presence or absence of the title \\"Mr.\\" is relatively minor and does not significantly alter the underlying meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, let's break down the simpler sentence: \\"Two rugby players square off.\\" Here, we can identify the following elements: 1. There are two rugby players involved. 2. They \\"square off,\\" which means that they prepare to face each other in a confrontation or challenge. Although the simpler sentence does not provide specific details such as the players' attire, the stadium's location, or the exact nature of the confrontation, it still accurately conveys the main idea of two rugby players engaging in a challenge. Therefore, it is fair to consider the sentence \\"Two rugby players square off\\" as a true sentence based on the original description."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Recently, he was spotted dancing at one of the rock legend's concerts, showing off his moves as he celebrated the music of his favorite artist. The lively scene prompted reactions from both fans and critics alike. Background on Chris Christie and Bruce Springsteen: Christie has attended numerous Springsteen concerts throughout his life, proudly boasting over 140 concerts to his name. His love for \\"The Boss\\" has been well-documented, even playing a role in Christie's political life with the governor often professing his admiration for the rock icon. However, Springsteen has been vocal about his political differences with the former governor and has not reciprocated the same sentiment. The concert: Bruce Springsteen's most recent concert, held at the MetLife Stadium, attracted thousands of fans, including high-profile personalities such as Chris Christie. As Springsteen performed the hit song \\"Dancing in the Dark,\\" the former governor could be seen energetically replicating the famous dance moves from the song's music video, much to the amusement of those around him. Eyewitness accounts and reactions: Concertgoers who witnessed Christie's dance moves shared their experience on social media platforms, with many expressing amusement at his unabashed enthusiasm. Some fans commended the politician for embracing his love for the music despite Springsteen's public disagreement with his policy stances. Others, however, were critical of Christie's appearance at the concert, citing his track record as governor and accusing him of attempting to capitalize on Springsteen's popularity. The political undertones present in some of Springsteen's music led to discussions about the contrast between the musician's messages and Christie's actions during his time in office. Official statements and context: Neither Chris Christie nor Bruce Springsteen have made official statements about the incident. However, the event has prompted a conversation about the role of political affiliations in fandom and the importance of remaining true to one's personal values despite potential rejection from admired figures. Conclusion: As the dust settles on the lively spectacle of Chris Christie dancing at a Bruce Springsteen concert, this instance highlights the complexities of celebrity and politics intertwining. While their common love for music may never bridge the gap between the two figures, the unabashed joy displayed by Christie at the concert is a reminder of the unifying power of music in the face of differences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick from: 1. yes 2. it is not possible to tell 3. no","completion":"3. no Step 1: Analyze the premise. The premise states that \\"no clear defense existed but it was a good place for lightning ambushes.\\" This suggests that despite a lack of clear defensive structures, the location had characteristics that made it suitable for fast, unexpected attacks on an opponent. Step 2: Compare the premise to the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"it was too bare to be a good place to ambush anyone.\\" This implies that the location was not suitable for ambushes due to a lack of cover or other elements that would allow for hiding and striking an opponent quickly and unexpectedly. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis contradicts the premise. The hypothesis contradicts the premise since the premise suggests that the location was a good place for lightning ambushes, while the hypothesis claims it was not a good place for ambushes.

Your job is to generate a question that can use the information provided to obtain the given answer. You should use the information on both passage and link information to create the question. Note that the answer to the question should be exactly the given answer, and if the answer is none, the answer to the question shouldn't be obtainable from the passage or linked information. Problem:Passage: In an early example of guerrilla filmmaking, Frankenheimer photographed Martin Balsam being ferried out to the supercarrier USS Kitty Hawk, berthed at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego (standing in for Gibraltar), without prior Defense Department permission. Frankenheimer needed a commanding figure to play Vice Admiral Farley C. Barnswell and asked his friend, well-known producer John Houseman to play him, to which he agreed, on condition that he have a fine bottle of wine (which is seen during the telephone scene), although he was uncredited for it. It was Houseman's American acting debut, and he would not appear onscreen again until his Oscar-winning role in The Paper Chase (1973). Frankenheimer also wanted a shot of Kirk Douglas entering the Pentagon, but could not get permission because of security considerations, so he rigged a movie camera in a parked station wagon to photograph Douglas walking up to the Pentagon. Douglas actually received salutes from military personnel inasmuch as he was wearing the uniform of a U.S. Marine Corps colonel. Several scenes, including one with nuns in the background, were shot inside Washington Dulles International Airport which had recently been built, and the production team were the first ever to film there. The alley and car park scene was shot in Hollywood, and other footage was shot in the Californian desert in 110 degree heat. The secret base and airstrip was specially built in the desert near Indio, California, and they borrowed an aircraft tail in one shot to make it look like a whole plane was off the picture. Originally the script had Lancaster die in a car crash at the end after hitting a bus, but finally this was edited out in favor of a small scene of him departing by taxi which was shot on a Sunday in Paris during production of The Train (1964). Link Information: The ship was launched on 21 May 1960 Answer: 4 Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding the passage. Usage: The passage describes various filming locations, actors, and situations in the production of an unnamed film. From this, we understand the story behind the scenes about the filming process, actors involved, their roles and circumstances that came about during the shoot. For example, in the statement \\"Frankenheimer needed a commanding figure to play Vice Admiral Farley C. Barnswell and asked his friend, well-known producer John Houseman to play him\\", we understand that Frankenheimer, probably the director, asked John Houseman to play a Vice Admiral character in his film. Part #2: Understand the linked information. Usage: From the sentence \\"The ship was launched on 21 May 1960\\", the key piece of information is that the ship, possibly referring to USS Kitty Hawk mentioned in the passage, was launched on the date specified. Part #3: Using the answer term in context. Usage: The answer given in this task was '4'. In this context, it's unclear what '4' refers to, as it can be related to any aspect of the numerous details given in the passage and the link. Depending on the question generated, the answer '4' could denote a year, a number of people, or other numerical figures present or inferred in the story. Part #4: Generating a question from the passage and linked information. Usage: The goal is to generate a question that makes the answer '4' from the information provided in the passage and the link. An example question could be: \\"How many years after the launch of the USS Kitty Hawk did John Houseman have his Oscar-winning role in The Paper Chase?\\" The answer would be '4' years after the USS Kitty Hawk's launch in 1960, as Houseman's Oscar-winning role happened in 1964, according to the passage. Part #5: Ensuring the question's answer should exactly match the given answer. Usage: Here, the generated question must have '4' as an exact answer. The previously given question \\"How many years after the launch of the USS Kitty Hawk did John Houseman have his Oscar-winning role in The Paper Chase?\\" fits this criteria, as its answer is indeed '4'. This is calculated by subtracting the launch year of the USS Kitty Hawk (1960) from the year of Houseman's Oscar-winning role (1964). The difference is four years, thus making the answer '4'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Igor tried to put the soccer ball in the tube, but the","completion":"diameter was too small to accommodate it. This sentence paints a vivid picture in the mind. Here, Igor is attempting to fit a soccer ball into a tube with unsuitable dimensions for such an action. They are unrelated objects in terms of their function, but in this scenario, Igor is exploring the possibility of an unusual interaction between them. The soccer ball, typically with a circumference of between 68-70cm for a standard size 5 ball used in professional play, requires a relatively large hole or opening to pass through. On the contrary, the suggestive context implies that the tube Igor has may be designed for something less broad, perhaps a poster, blueprints, or some form of elongated, narrow materials. So naturally, this disparity in requirements creates a problem for Igor's intentions. In this narrative, there's also a display of the principle of physical fit, which predetermines what objects and shapes can fit into others. Like a puzzle piece, the soccer ball, with its spherical shape, cannot be forced into a cylindrical tube without enough diameter, preserving its initial form. However, if the tube were larger, or the ball smaller, a successful fit could occur. Furthermore, this situation could symbolize the larger life principle where not all things, no matter the effort or intent, can be forced to fit where they do not naturally belong. Similarly, it is about accepting the reality of circumstantial constraints, understanding limitations and the inherent properties of objects, or perhaps even people. Depending on the backstory of this scenario, this could also show a trial and error learning method from Igor’s part, exploring what works and what doesn’t. So while it seems like a simple sentence about a small act, there's a surprising amount of potential depth and context to be derived from the imagery. In conclusion, the given sentence \\"Igor tried to put the soccer ball in the tube, but the diameter was too small to accommodate it,\\" portrays an interesting scenario from a spatial and metaphorical perspective. It brings physical constraints into focus, shows the essence of trying, failing, and learning, and can also be regarded as a symbol for incompatible fits in broader life situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Grey Context: John Ottway (Liam Neeson) works in Alaska, killing wolves that threaten an oil drilling team. On his last day on the job, he shoots one. That evening, Ottway writes a letter \\"without purpose\\" to his wife, Ana (Anne Openshaw), explaining his plans to commit suicide. He hears a distant wolf howl and doesn't follow through. The next day, Ottway and other oil drillers board a plane. During the flight, Ottway dreams of sleeping with his wife in bed but is awakened by a loud bang. He buckles up in fear of a possible plane crash. Shortly afterwards, the back of the plane is torn off and luggage starts getting sucked out. Then the plane tips upside down and the roof gets ripped off. Ottway blacks out just before it crashes. Eight people including Ottway survive the crash. One of the team, Lewenden (James Badge Dale), is mortally wounded. Taking charge, Ottway sets the survivors on the task of building a fire. While doing this, he discovers a corpse, and is attacked by the grey wolf feeding on it. After saving Ottway, the group surmises that they are in the wolves' territory. They decide to take turns keeping watch for the predators. Later, Hernandez (Ben Bray) is killed by two wolves. Ottway suggests they leave the crash site, but Diaz (Frank Grillo) questions his leadership. While searching for the wallets of their deceased colleagues, intending to return them to their families, Diaz finds an emergency wrist watch containing a radio beacon. The group then leaves the site. While walking, Flannery (Joe Anderson) falls behind, and is killed by wolves. One of them spots a pack of wolves approaching, and the survivors run for the trees, lighting a fire in an attempt to ward off their attackers. The group sets about producing makeshift weaponry. Diaz threatens Ottway with a knife, but is disarmed and ultimately begins regretting his actions. An omega wolf sent by the alpha wolf to test them attacks, but they kill and roast it for food. Diaz beheads the corpse and throws the head back at the pack, a move noted by the group... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Grey,\\" the survivors, including John Ottway, run towards the trees after spotting a pack of wolves approaching them. This decision is taken as they believe that the trees would provide them with some protection against the wolves. In addition, they light a fire in an attempt to ward off their attackers, since wolves are often deterred by fire due to its brightness and heat. Upon reaching the trees, the group focuses on producing makeshift weaponry to defend themselves against the wolves. They manage to kill an omega wolf that was sent by the alpha wolf to test their capabilities. After roasting and eating the wolf, Diaz, one of the survivors, beheads the corpse and throws the head back at the pack as a symbol of defiance. Throughout their ordeal, the survivors continue to follow Ottway's lead, although there is some initial resistance from Diaz, who questions his leadership. The group understands that they are in the wolves' territory and that they need to be vigilant and resourceful in order to survive. As a result, they take turns keeping watch for the predators, and their journey becomes a desperate attempt to find safety while evading the wolf pack that is relentlessly pursuing them. The decision to run towards the trees and rely on fire and makeshift weapons for protection demonstrates the survivors' resourcefulness and determination in the face of a dire situation. It is their adaptability and unity, along with their innate survival instincts, which enable them to cope with the extraordinary challenges they face in the harsh and unforgiving Alaskan wilderness. Through their harrowing ordeal, the survivors learn important lessons about trust, resilience, courage, and the will to live, even when faced with the most life-threatening circumstances. As they continue to evade the ever-present danger from the wolves, their actions and decisions serve to underscore the power of human spirit and the importance of working together when faced with adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Clean the old contact lens case: Before storing the small pills in an old contact lens case, ensure that it is thoroughly cleaned. One could wash it with warm soapy water, rinse it properly, and let it air dry to remove any residue, bacteria, or contaminants from the previous use. 2. Label the case: Since contact lens cases usually have two compartments, using a permanent marker or a small label, clearly identify the sections of the case for differentiation purposes. This can help avoid any mix-ups, especially if one is storing different types/styles of pills. 3. Place the pills in the compartments: Open the lids of the case's compartments and carefully place the small pills in the appropriate sections. The contact lens case's standard size makes it suitable for storing a limited number of pills; therefore, consider the quantity of pills being stored vs their size and make sure not to overload the compartments. 4. Secure the lids: Once the pills have been placed appropriately, firmly close the lids of the contact lens case's compartments. Ensure that they are fully sealed to avoid any leaks or spills. 5. Store the case: Store the repurposed contact lens case with the pills in a cool, dry, and safe location. Keep it out of children's reach and ensure that it is easily identifiable to prevent any unintended consumption.

Mado has been well-kept, and Tony savagely beats her for being so deeply involved with Grutter.

Seattle Slew (February 15, 1974 - May 7, 2002) was an American Thoroughbred race horse who won the Triple Crown in 1977--the tenth of twelve horses to accomplish the feat. He is the only horse to have won the Triple Crown while having been undefeated in any race previous. Honored as the 1977 Horse of the Year, he was also a champion at age two, three and four. In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century Seattle Slew was ranked ninth. Seattle Slew was a dark brown colt with a small white patch of hair by his left rear hoof bred by Ben S. Castleman. He was sired by Bold Reasoning who won the Jersey Derby and Withers Stakes in 1971. His dam My Charmer went on to produce the 2000 Guineas winner Lomond and Seattle Dancer. Horse owners since the early 1970s, Karen Taylor was a former flight attendant, and her husband, Mickey Taylor, was a lumberman. They lived in White Swan, Washington. Their friend Dr. Jim Hill, a veterinarian, recommended that they buy Seattle Slew, a son of Bold Reasoning out of the mare My Charmer, at a 1975 Fasig-Tipton yearling auction. Seattle Slew was foaled at Ben Castleman's White Horse Acres Farm near Lexington, Kentucky. Hill and his wife, Sally, had met the Taylors through the horse business. In partnership, they bought 13 prospects, including Seattle Slew, who was sold for 17,500 (equivalent to 80,000 in 2017). They named him for the city of Seattle and the sloughs which loggers once used to transport heavy logs. Karen felt that the spelling of slough--a slow-moving channel of the Pacific Northwest--would be too hard for people to remember, so the spelling was changed to Slew. A later co-owner was Glenn Rasmussen, the accountant for the equine partnerships. Seattle Slew's owners sent the colt to Billy Turner, a friend and former steeplechase rider who had trained horses seasonally in Maryland since the early 1960s. Based at Belmont Park in the mid-1970s, Turner accepted Seattle Slew and another Taylor-Hill purchase and sent them to Andor Farm in Monkton, where his wife at the time, Paula, taught yearlings to be ridden. At maturity, he reached 16 hands (64 inches, 163 cm) high. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Who was Slew's trainer while the Taylors owned him?","completion":"Seattle Slew's trainer while the Taylors owned him was Billy Turner.
