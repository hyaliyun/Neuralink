Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia . It contains two species , which both are critically endangered : Huso dauricus ( Georgi , 1775 ) ( kaluga ) Huso huso ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) ( beluga ) Recent data indicate a polyphyletic origin of the genus Huso , and it is suggested that the two Huso species should be included in the genus Acipenser .

Movie title: The Garden of Eden Context: Toni le Braun is a Opera Singer hopeful who gets a letter from Budapest saying she has a job singing. Unfortunately, she soon learns that the local in which she is singing is not an opera house but a cabaret. When she refuses the advances of one of the rich patrons of the cabaret, and the wardrobe mistress helps her escape, they are both fired. What Toni does not know is that the wardrobe mistress is a baroness, whose husband was killed in the great war. Rather than loose her old life, she works all year and when she gets her husbands yearly cheque (like pension i think) she lives in Monte Carlo the way she did before the war, until her money runs out, and then she returns to Budapest. Toni is now the Baroness' ward, and two men (uncle and nephew) fall in love with her. Toni becomes engaged to the young Richard. Everything is wonderful, but as the movie says \\"in all the fairy tales where people live happily ever after, the men did not have relatives\\". At the wedding Richard's other uncle arrives, who is the benefactor of the cabaret who had tried advancing on Toni. She is ashamed for now she knows everyone will know she is not really the Baroness' daughter and breaks of the engagement and leaves. But the uncle who lives in Hungary assured Richard that Toni was a wonderful girl and that he should not let the old humbug relatives use money as an excuse to not marry her. They wed and all live happily ever after. Answer:","completion":"An opera singer is a professional vocalist who specializes in the performance of classical music known as opera. Opera singers are trained to use their voices in a powerful, resonant, and emotive manner to produce a unique sound that can project and be heard clearly over a large orchestra in an opera house without the need for amplification. They often possess exceptional vocal range, control, and technique, enabling them to perform complex and demanding pieces composed by the great opera composers such as Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, and Wagner. In the context of the movie \\"The Garden of Eden,\\" the main character, Toni le Braun, is an aspiring opera singer who dreams of making it big in the world of classical music. She receives a letter from Budapest, offering her a job as a singer. Upon her arrival, however, she discovers that the venue for her performance is not an opera house, but a cabaret. This twist in the plot highlights the stark difference between the prestigious world of opera that Toni aspires to and the potentially seedy, morally ambiguous environment of a cabaret. Throughout her journey, Toni encounters various challenges and colorful characters, including a baroness who becomes her guardian, and two men, an uncle and his nephew, who fall in love with her. Toni eventually gets engaged to the young Richard, but complications arise during their wedding when Richard's other uncle, the benefactor of the cabaret, arrives. Toni is ashamed and believes that her true identity as a singer, rather than a baroness' daughter, will be exposed. Consequently, she breaks off the engagement and leaves. However, the story resolves itself when the uncle who lives in Hungary convinces Richard that Toni is a wonderful girl and deserves his love regardless of her background or the opinions of his relatives. In the end, the couple weds and they all enjoy a happy life together. From this summary, we can understand that while Toni's dreams of becoming an opera singer do not necessarily come true in the expected manner, her journey takes her through various experiences that ultimately lead her to a fulfilling life and love. The story serves as a testament to the power of resilience, self-discovery, and the importance of following one's own path, even when it diverges from the conventional route to success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise.

Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Q:Given the following context: With Morton, the New York Dolls recorded Too Much Too Soon in 1974 at A&R Studios in New York City. The album was later mastered at Sterling Sound and Masterdisk. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, \\"bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'.\\" Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the \\"looser\\" feel he provided for their music. \\"That man is completely unpretentious\\", Johansen said of the producer. \\"He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life.\\" The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together. To complete the album, they had to record cover songs and re-record some of the band's earlier demos; \\"Babylon\\", \\"Who Are the Mystery Girls?\\", \\"It's Too Late\\" and \\"Human Being\\" had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, \\"Teenage News\\" and \\"Too Much Too Soon\\", before working with Morton, but neither was considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling he had been in a rush: \\"He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders. He didn't want to tell me who had told him that but obviously it was the managers. I just walked out, it was all driving me nuts.\\"According to journalist Tony Fletcher, Morton would have been more productive on Too Much Too Soon had it not been for his alcoholism and the lifestyles of the band members—bassist Arthur Kane was also an alcoholic, while Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan had heroin addictions.

Write the answer: If travelling at 30m.p.h. in a car what is the overall stopping distance in feet?","completion":"To calculate the overall stopping distance in feet, we need to consider both the thinking distance and the braking distance. Here, we will be using the given speed of 30 miles per hour (m.p.h.) and converting it into feet per second (fps) for easier calculations. Step 1: Convert speed from m.p.h. to fps 1 mile = 5280 feet 1 hour = 3600 seconds 30 miles per hour = (30 * 5280) / 3600 = 44 feet per second (fps) Step 2: Calculate thinking distance The thinking distance is the distance the car travels while the driver reacts to an obstacle before applying the brakes. On average, the reaction time is assumed to be 1.5 seconds. Thinking distance = speed × reaction time Thinking distance = 44fps × 1.5s = 66 feet Step 3: Calculate braking distance The braking distance is the distance the car travels while it decelerates to a complete stop after the brakes are applied. The estimated braking distances can be calculated using a general rule: Braking distance = (speed in fps)^2 / 64. For our case: Braking distance = (44 fps)^2 / 64 = 1936 / 64 = 30.25 feet Step 4: Calculate overall stopping distance The overall stopping distance is the sum of the thinking distance and the braking distance. Overall stopping distance = Thinking distance + Braking distance Overall stopping distance = 66 feet + 30.25 feet ≈ 96.25 feet So, when traveling at 30 m.p.h. in a car, the overall stopping distance is approximately 96.25 feet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide a more detailed understanding, the complete process in its entirety, including the missing first step, is as follows: 1. The initiation of natural processes involving the movement and interaction of various particles (such as water, wind, ice, and/or living organisms) with the surface of the rocks: In order to begin any type of erosion or wearing away of the rocks, natural forces need to be involved. These forces, comprising of natural elements, are responsible for the initial contact and interaction with rock surfaces. The particles can be sediment, soil, sand, or other small fragments carried by the aforementioned forces. 2. The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks: As these particles make contact with the rock surface, their abrasive nature and force result in the dislodging of tiny rock fragments. Over time, this constant attrition leads to a change in the rock's structure. 3. The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks: This continuous action is crucial for the process to progress. The constant battering and scraping of the rock surface cause the rock to weaken and become more susceptible to further abrasion. 4. The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact: The culmination of the constant impact of particles and natural forces causes the rock to break apart into smaller pieces. This can happen in various forms, such as physical weathering (freezing and thawing), chemical weathering (mineral dissolution), or biological weathering (plant or animal activity impacting the rock). 5. The pieces of the rock are now small rocks: The initial large rock structure has now been reduced to smaller rock pieces or fragments through the ongoing erosion process. These smaller rocks can then be transported to different locations by water, wind, ice, or other natural forces. 6. The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces: As the smaller rocks or fragments are subjected to the same forces that caused the initial erosion, they are further broken down into even smaller particles, such as sand, silt, or clay. This process continues until the rock material has been completely transformed and integrated into the natural environment. In summary, the missing first step involves the initiation of natural processes that bring various particles in contact with the rock surface, ultimately causing erosion and the subsequent transformation of the rock into smaller fragments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The second smallest age group is the 'Under 18 years old' group, accounting for 20.2% of the population. To compare these two groups in terms of percentage difference, we can subtract the smaller percentage from the larger percentage: 22.6% (Second biggest age group) - 20.2% (Second smallest age group) = 2.4% Therefore, there are 2.4% more people in the second biggest age group (45 to 64 years old) compared to the second smallest age group (Under 18 years old)."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

Instead of focusing on the end-goal, break the process down into manageable, daily goals. For example, instead of saying \\"My goal today is to get a raise at work,\\" approach the goal from a more manageable perspective. Start with smaller goals, such as getting to work early every day, or going out of your way to have a conversation with your boss. The point of the baby steps is to build up to your end-goal through obtainable, tangible steps. There are countless distractions in today's world, and it can be easy to get side-tracked. Keep your Must-Do list handy and refer to it whenever you feel yourself drifting off course. Don't allow yourself to get sucked into time wasting activities when you have goals to obtain. Set aside designated leisure time for the day. Resist the temptation to \\"work on it tomorrow.\\" Remind yourself that you need to accomplish your list today. Take the time to practice skills that you haven't mastered yet. More skills means more opportunities for you. Hone your skills that you need to achieve your goal. For example, if you are looking for a raise, work on the skills you need for the job on your free time in order to increase your effectiveness at work. Broaden your skillset. Work on skills that may not relate to your current goals, but that interest you. Not only will this keep you productive, it will make you a more well-rounded and capable person. You will hit obstacles and setbacks. Keep your mind focused on your goals and your heart positive. Celebrate each small victory to give yourself a boost in spirit. Approach each defeat as a lesson to be learned; dust yourself off and try another way. Confidence is essential to obtaining goals and changing your life. It will affect all of your interactions with others, and will drastically increase your motivation. Take pride in your actions and thoughts, and own your mistakes. Be able to laugh at yourself, but avoid self-deprecation. There is a difference between being confident and being cocky. Avoid over-inflating your ego by tempering your confidence with some realism. Cockiness is often viewed as a sign on inner insecurity.

Cemeteries provide fragmentary information, e.g., during February and March 1740, 47 children were buried in St. Catherine's parish. The normal death rate tripled in January and February 1740, and burials averaged out about 50% higher during the twenty-one-month crisis than for the years 1737-1739, according to Dickson. Summing up all his sources, Dickson suggests two estimates:1) that 38% of the Irish population died during the crisis, and2) that between 13-20% excess mortality occurred for 1740-1741. Based on contemporary accounts and burial parish records, famine-related deaths may have totaled 300,000-480,000 in Ireland, with rates highest in the south and east of the country. This was a proportionately greater toll than during the most severe years of the Great Famine . That famine, however, was unique in \\"cause, scale and timing,\\" persisting over several years. The majority of the deaths occurred amongst the lower classes, with the poorest third of the population gaining all their nutrition from potatoes alone, the crop which the blight affected. Therefore, when the potatoes blight occurred these people were left with practically no means of sustenance. Which crisis proportionately was worse the Great Frost or the Great Famine?","completion":"While both the Great Frost of 1740-1741 and the Great Famine of 1845-1849 were devastating events in Irish history, the proportionate impact of each crisis must be evaluated considering their respective contexts, durations, and outcomes. The Great Frost (1740-1741) was a climate anomaly that led to widespread crop failure, death of livestock, and food shortages across Ireland. Due to limited documentation during that era, precise death figures are challenging to determine. However, based on the information available, it is estimated that between 300,000 and 480,000 people, constituting approximately 13-20% of the Irish population, died during this crisis. This was exacerbated by the fact that it occurred over a much shorter period, lasting only 21 months. On the other hand, the Great Famine (1845-1849) was caused by the failure of the potato crop due to a fungal disease known as late blight. This crisis lasted over four years, during which successive crop failures resulted in widespread food scarcity. The famine claimed the lives of approximately one million people, which was close to 25% of the Irish population at the time. Additionally, approximately one million more people emigrated from the country due to the severe conditions, leading to a population decline of nearly 50%. Taking these factors into account, although the Great Frost had a higher mortality rate in a much shorter time frame, the Great Famine had a more profound and long-lasting impact on Ireland's population and socio-economic landscape. The Great Famine's enduring legacy, in terms of emigration, societal changes, cultural impacts, and the formation of Irish national identity, makes it a more significant crisis proportionately when compared to the Great Frost. In conclusion, while both crises had devastating consequences for Ireland and its population, the Great Famine's extended duration, more significant death toll, and long-lasting effects make it proportionately worse for the country than the Great Frost."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is some advice for you to _ the generation gap .Don't argue with your parents. Don't get to your parents when you are angry.Your parents probably won't consider your ideas if you are shouting at them. And you can't express yourself well if you are angry. Go to someplace to cool off . Make sure you understand why you are unhappy. Then think about what you want to say to your parents. If you don't think you can speak to them at the moment, try writing a letter. Try to reach a compromise . Perhaps you and your parents disagree on something.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: \\"Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.\\" The track \\"Most of the Time\\", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while \\"What Was It You Wanted?\\" has been interpreted both as a...

Soon after evading the government, mainly agent Armstrong, as well as keeping the UFO in seclusion, Tyler goes through dramatic physical changes and gains superhuman powers due to his dramatic trip into space via the UFO, including enhanced strength and telepathy, and he almost as tall as Nick. The situation becomes even more difficult to cover up considering that Tyler is being constantly blown off by Nick, due to Nick's efforts at chasing Julie Gunn, as well as Nick having to make a science project to graduate high school and reptile-like aliens that have begun to appear and pursue Tyler. After having literally no one left to turn to, Tyler decides to tell agent Armstrong about the UFO. After agent Armstrong explains to Tyler about the effects that his trip into space had on his body, he shoots the ship with a laser gun, thereby critically damaging it, before he reveals himself to Tyler as a reptile-like alien in disguise and captures him. Nick, feeling guilty for constantly doubting and ignoring Tyler, goes to the UFO hideout to try to apologize. Upon finding that Tyler is missing and the UFO damaged, he begins an attempt to repair the UFO. After trying all night, he is successful and the UFO takes him to the hidden underground fortress in which the aliens are residing and realizes that it is actually an impact crater from the aliens' crash-landing on Earth.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Now, I have a new situation: Keith is an environmental scientist. He was studying the loss of ozone layer and its effect on different species. His data showed that in the beginning or twentieth century there were hardly any loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time period as time A. Further inquiry revealed that things didn't go well at the end of twentieth century - when there were severe loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time as time B.

Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.\\"? The answer is:","completion":"Question: What are the key characteristics of the mutualistic relationship between flowering plants and insects in the pollination process, and how can these characteristics be observed through pollination syndromes and the ways pollinators are attracted to flowers? Answer: The mutualistic relationship between flowering plants and insects in the pollination process is characterized by the transfer of pollen for the purpose of fertilization and sexual reproduction, with insects being the primary transporters of pollen. This relationship benefits both parties, as plants achieve successful pollination, while insects obtain energy-rich nectar. The various flower traits, such as colors and combinations, and the production of attractant pheromones differentiate specific types of pollinators and exemplify pollination syndromes, which originated through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators are attracted to flowers by their bright colorations, including ultraviolet light, and the release of pheromones.

MIAMI — Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul’s right index finger reportedly was amputated Wednesday following the fireworks injury he suffered on July 4. ESPN obtained medical charts Wednesday night, which were posted on Twitter, that revealed Pierre-Paul’s finger was amputated earlier in the day at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami and he needed skin grafts for his right arm, which likely means he suffered from third-degree burns, which are the most severe. The network earlier had reported JPP suffered burns on his palms and three fingers, and nerve damage in one finger. A source who has been in contact with those close to JPP said he had the option of saving the finger, but there were no assurances it would heal or be fully functional. Here’s a tweet of the medical report: Also, according to Bleacher Report, Pierre-Paul suffered a fracture to his right thumb and may have fractures in other fingers on his right hand. Kevin Roenbeck, New Jersey hand surgeon, cautioned against expecting too much too soon. Based on the medical chart, which the doctor said was an operating room schedule, Roenbeck noted the entire bone was amputated, all the way into his palm, including his entire knuckle. The strength in JPP’s right hand may never be the same. “That cannot be dismissed,” Roenbeck said. “There’s no guarantee he can be the same defensive end he was. It changes your hand forever and narrows the palm.” Some people lose up to 35 percent of their strength when losing an index finger, others as little as 5 to 10 percent, Roenbeck said. Then there is the issue of the burns Pierre-Paul suffered. Roenbeck said they could either be severe second-degree burns or third-degree, based on the chart. In either case, they often take a while to heal. There also is the chance of infection, and further surgery. Roenbeck estimated Pierre-Paul could be out up to three months, but that was merely a guess based on the information available. The news came as a shock to the Giants, and on the heels of the situation taking a strange turn with Pierre-Paul shunning the team. He refused to meet with team personnel who made the trip to Miami, sources confirmed to The Post, and JPP reportedly refused the team’s offer to set him up with hand specialists in Manhattan. A source said his agent, Eugene Parker, was responsible for keeping the Giants away, didn’t want word of the amputation leaked — the posted chart could result in medical privacy and/or HIPAA violations — and has taken command of the situation. The Giants’ contingent, including Ronnie Barnes, the team’s senior vice president of medical services, and former linebacker Jessie Armstead, flew to Miami hoping to meet with Pierre-Paul, however they were rebuffed. FOX Sports reported Pierre-Paul doesn’t want to meet with anyone at the moment, and several close friends and teammates have been unable to get in touch with over the phone or via text message. A Giants source told The Post, “We don’t know anything about his condition.” The source also said, “We’re more concerned than upset.” Repeated calls to members of Pierre-Paul’s family went unreturned. Pierre-Paul posted a since-deleted video on Instagram last week in which he is standing in front of a U-Haul van and mentions setting off fireworks. Also, an alleged neighbor of his posted a tweet, also deleted, with a photo of the same U-Haul van that the neighbor claimed was filled with fireworks. Because Pierre-Paul never signed his franchise-tag tender, which would have paid him 14.8 million this season, he currently is not under contract with the Giants. Further complicating matters, he skipped the Giants’ offseason program and minicamp. If the offer is rescinded, the 26-year-old defensive lineman would become a free agent. A source expects JPP to sign the tender, granted the Giants don’t take it away. — Additional reporting by Paul Schwartz and Steve Serby ||||| NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — This situation with JPP has gone from bizarre to downright frightening. According to an ESPN report on Wednesday evening, the two-time Pro Bowl defensive end had his right index finger amputated as a result of a Fourth of July fireworks mishap. ESPN obtained medical charts that show Giants DE Jason Pierre-Paul had right index finger amputated today. pic.twitter.com/VI5cbS1uCw — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) July 8, 2015 Giants DE Jason Pierre-Paul finger amputated today. Medical source expects him to play this season, \\"sooner than people think.\\" — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) July 8, 2015 That shocking news came following a report from WFAN and NFL Media’s Kim Jones that said the Giants had sent officials down to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Florida to check on the health of Pierre-Paul, only to leave without seeing him. Giants trainer Ronnie Barnes is heading back to East Rutherford from Miami without seeing Jason Pierre-Paul. — Kimberly Jones (@KimJonesSports) July 8, 2015 Giants officials were reportedly denied entry to Pierre-Paul’s hospital room on Tuesday, not making it past the waiting room, CBS2 reported. The Daily News reported later that the 26-year-old former All-Pro’s family had demanded privacy. The latest ESPN report appears to explain why. Following the incident over the holiday weekend, ESPN reported Pierre-Paul had suffered “severe burns” to his palm and fingers in the fireworks accident. His fingers were said to be intact despite early reports to the contrary. He underwent tests on one finger for nerve damage, “and doctors believe there will be no permanent damage or disfigurement of his hands,” the network reported at the time. CBS2’s Otis Livingston reported the injuries are not believed to be career-threatening, so Pierre-Paul is expected to play this year. But it is not clear when. The Giants have since withdrawn a long-term contract offer worth 60 million, which Pierre-Paul was likely to turn down, according to NFL Media’s Ian Rapoport. A team spokesperson told Rapoport that the “first concern is for JPP’s well-being.” Pierre-Paul is currently not under contract for the 2015 season, having not yet signed his 14.8 million franchise tag tender offer. The Giants can rescind that offer, which would make the sixth-year pro a free agent. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"New York Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul reportedly had his right index finger amputated following a fireworks accident on July 4th.

In the first quarter, the Chargers would score 2 field goals to start out: Travis Coons kicked them both from 21 and 40 yards out to make the lead 3-0 to 6-0. The Browns took the lead however when DeShone Kizer found David Njoku on a 28-yard pass to make it 7-6. Though, the Chargers would move back into the lead when Coons kicked his third field goal of the day from 22 yards out to make it 9-7. This would remain the halftime score as neither team scored in the second quarter. In the third quarter however, the Chargers managed to increase their lead when Philip Rivers found Keenan Allen on a 7-yard pass to make it 16-7. This would be followed up by Coons kicking a fourth field goal from 27 yards out to put his team up 19-7. The Browns scored their only points in the half during the fourth quarter when Zane Gonzalez kicked a 35-yard field goal. The losing streak continued as the Browns fell to the Chargers 19-10. With the loss, the Browns fell to 0-12 and the losing streak was extended to 13 consecutive games while their road losing streak was extended to 19 consecutive games. The loss made the Browns 1-27 in the first 28 games under Jackson and Brown, overtaking the 1976-1977 Buccaneers (2-26) for the worst 28 game start under a HC and GM in NFL history.

This one is about why semicolons arent as universal as SOME PEOPLE insist on thinking they are and you spend a literal eighth of a minute making the post entirely about you and your semicolon needs Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"In recent years, there has been some debate on the significance and appropriate usage of semicolons within written content. While some people insist that semicolons are essential to the correct structure and clarity of a sentence, others argue that they are not as universally important as these proponents claim. To examine this argument, it's crucial to consider the role of the semicolon in writing, its benefits, and the reasons behind the varying opinions on its usage. First, let's explore the original purpose of a semicolon. The semicolon (;) is primarily used to connect two closely related independent clauses, each of which could stand alone as a complete sentence. Unlike a period, however, the semicolon implies a stronger relationship between these two related thoughts, suggesting a logical progression or connection of ideas. Moreover, semicolons can be used to separate items in a list where individual items already contain internal punctuation, such as commas. In this case, the semicolon provides clarity and ensures that the individual elements within the list are easily distinguishable. In defense of those who advocate for the regular application of semicolons, these punctuation marks can provide clarity and nuance to written content. When used correctly, semicolons can showcase an author's attention to detail, their command of language, and their commitment to the effective communication of their ideas. Additionally, semicolons can add an element of sophistication to writing, particularly when contrasting with more simplistic sentence structures or conveying complex thoughts. However, it is important to understand that not all writing favors the use of semicolons. In particular, various styles of writing, such as informal communication, often rely on shorter and more concise sentence structures. Additionally, some writing conventions, like the Associated Press Stylebook, tend to avoid or discourage the use of semicolons in favor of other punctuation marks, such as em dashes or periods, to promote clarity and simplicity. This preference for alternate punctuation can contribute to the diminishing significance of semicolons within specific contexts. Another reason why people may not view semicolons as universal is the growing popularity of alternative methods of communication, such as texting, email, and social media platforms. In these fast-paced and informal environments, punctuation tends to be less rigid and more focused on conveying information quickly and informally. As a result, punctuation marks like semicolons may be seen as superfluous or overly formal, leading to their decreased prevalence. In sum, while there may be some staunch supporters of semicolon usage and its importance in writing, it is essential to recognize that the semicolon's role may not be as universally accepted as these advocates imply. The popularity and appropriate utilization of semicolons largely depend on the context, style, and purpose of the written content in question. As the English language evolves and adapts to new methods of communication, it is crucial to remain flexible and open-minded about punctuation conventions like semicolons and their place in modern writing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The price of milk may be going up. There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st. California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices. The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell. The drought around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce the effect of the price rise here. The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing. Options: A Short supplies from other states. B Being short of rain. C The California court.

The spouse of Logan cheated on him with Brett because","completion":"The spouse of Logan cheated on him with Brett because they were experiencing feelings of deep dissatisfaction and emotional disconnect within their marriage, which led them to seek comfort, validation, and connection outside their relationship with Logan. To understand this situation better, let's look at the various factors that might have contributed to the spouse's decision to cheat. 1. Emotional dissatisfaction: Over time, the emotional bond between Logan and their spouse might have weakened due to various reasons such as unresolved conflicts, lack of intimacy, or growing apart as individuals. This could have led the spouse to feel lonely and unfulfilled, driving them towards seeking emotional comfort and support from another person. 2. Lack of communication: Communication is one of the most essential aspects of maintaining a healthy relationship. When a couple fails to express their feelings, needs, and expectations openly, it could lead to misunderstandings and emotional stagnation. In this case, the spouse might have felt that their concerns and feelings were not being valued or addressed by Logan. 3. Incompatibility issues: Sometimes, couples might discover that they have different goals or values that are hard to reconcile. This could be in terms of their professional aspirations, family plans, lifestyle choices, or even sexual preferences. These incompatibilities could lead to feelings of frustration and resentment, eventually pushing the spouse towards someone else who shared their perspective. 4. Sexual dissatisfaction: Physical intimacy is an important aspect of a romantic relationship. If the spouse felt sexually unfulfilled or neglected by Logan, they might have sought satisfaction elsewhere with someone like Brett, who could potentially offer them the excitement and passion they were craving. 5. Self-esteem and validation: The human need for validation and recognition might have led the spouse to cheat on Logan with Brett. If the spouse felt undervalued or unappreciated in their relationship, engaging in an affair might have given them a sense of excitement and a temporary ego boost, making them feel desired and wanted. 6. The thrill of the forbidden: Sometimes, people choose to cheat on their partners because they are drawn to the excitement and risk involved in pursuing a clandestine affair. The secrecy and adrenaline rush associated with an affair could have been a powerful lure for the spouse, especially if their relationship with Logan had become routine or predictable. 7. External influences: People’s social environments, friends, and cultural norms can also impact their decisions to cheat. If the spouse was surrounded by friends or colleagues who encouraged infidelity or if they believed that cheating was a common and acceptable behavior within their social circle, they might have felt more inclined to engage in an affair. Ultimately, the spouse's decision to cheat on Logan with Brett was a complex and multifaceted issue, involving a combination of emotional, physical, personal, and social factors. Cheating is never a simple or straightforward problem, and it is essential for both Logan and their spouse to engage in open and honest communication to understand the underlying issues that led to the affair and to work towards finding a resolution that heals their relationship or helps them move forward separately."},{"prompt":"Process: - A sperm meets an egg in the uterus of a woman - The sperm implants itself into the egg - The sperm and egg form a zygote on the wall of the uterus - The fetus grows and develops - The woman gives birth to a baby - The baby is raised by parents until it is able to take care of itself - The person goes out into the world and finds a job - The person meets other people and has a life - The person gets a career, and gets married - The person retires and eventually passes away - Question: suppose less sperm meet eggs happens, how will it affect MORE babies.

On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Which place would have thinner \\"A horizon\\", Kenya or Tanzania? Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

He needs to determine the properties of each state. Hint: As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature.

They say revenge is a dish best served cold. And, for one jilted wife, if a few bugs and grubs are thrown in, all the better. For Rachael Butler – whose husband had an affair with Nadine Dorries – has revealed how she has voted ‘hundreds of times’ for the Tory MP to take part in I’m A Celebrity’s gruesome bushtucker trials. Hard to stomach: Nadine Dorries, 55, who was suspended from the Conservative Party when she went on ITV show I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, has been repeatedly voted to undergo sickening Bushtucker Trials. Yuck: Coronation Street actress Helen Flanagan (left) takes on Nadine Dorries (right) in a Bushtucker trial as Ant and Dec (back right) watch on during an episode of ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. The 56-year-old mother of two has even put Miss Dorries’s hotline number into her speed dial to save crucial seconds when she is voting against her on the ITV reality. The 55-year-old politician has already had to face two gruelling ordeals, in which she was forced to eat a camel’s toe and a lamb’s testicle, and locked inside a wooden coffin filled with maggots, crickets and cockroaches. And there could be bigger trials to come – she has been suspended from the Conservative Party and faces questions upon her return about her reasons for abandoning her post for up to four weeks on full pay. Mrs Butler, who was married to husband John for 30 years before their split last year, said: ‘I voted for her to do the trial thing.

It’s worth the money. ‘The public seem to be picking on her and I’m like, “Carry on, keep on picking on Dorries, she deserves everything she gets”.’ Mrs Butler first met Miss Dorries, then married to her ex-husband Paul, from whom she split in 2006, in the late 1990s when they became neighbours in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire. Their daughters attended the same school, and the couples used to meet regularly for dinner, even going on holiday together to St Lucia in 2000. Together: Rachael Butler (left), 56, of Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, hit the headlines in January 2011 when Nadine Dorries (right) - her friend of 13 years - admitted having a fling with her husband John. Scary: Nadine Dorris (in a 'bug burial' Bushtucker Trial) has drawn criticism for swapping her parliamentary duties for the Australian jungle, but pledged to donate her MP's salary during her time on the show to charity. But last year the friendship ended after it emerged the MP had started a relationship with Mr Butler. Mrs Butler said at the time she became suspicious of her husband ‘when he started to go to the pub a lot’. She added: ‘Before Christmas he was going out every night and he said he had to meet friends. ‘Some nights he just never came home. I kept saying to him, “Is there another woman?”. He would say, “No, no, no, there isn’t”. Foolishly I believed him. ‘My marriage hasn’t been in good shape for some years. It died a death some time ago. But this doesn’t excuse Nadine for what she did. ‘I just want everyone to know that Nadine Dorries is not the saintly person she appears to be. Because she’s an MP, people think of her as a pillar of society but in fact she’s a marriage-wrecker.’ Miss Dorries and Mr Butler split in October last year after around nine months together. But Mrs Butler has refused to forget the hurt their relationship has caused. She said yesterday: ‘It did all die down and now she is in the public eye again. It’s a bit annoying. ‘She’s never been into that sort of thing, camping and roughing it. She likes creature comforts and luxury hotels. She is definitely doing it for the publicity and for the money. ‘She will probably need the money when she gets out because she might not have a job. I want her to stay in there, I don’t want her being voted off.

Article: An anti-wolf Montana hunter sparked outrage on social media after running over two young wolves with his wife’s van. Toby Bridges runs a Facebook page called “Lobo Watch” in which he details his plan to rid Montana of wolves. The group describes itself as “Sportsmen Taking Charge of Predator Problems.\\" “We are here to support the efforts of all who feel that in order to save wildlife, outdoor recreation and a healthy outdoor lifestyle, sportsmen must fight radical anti-hunting environmental groups and state and federal wildlife agencies which have abandoned those who have financed real wildlife conservation efforts in this country for the past 75 to 100 years,” the page says. (Daily Mail) On Sept. 18, the group posted photographs of a dead wolf in a photo album labelled “Conquests.” In one of the pictures the van can be seen. “The idiot braggart and social sociopath who did this is a lowdown confirmed coward and anyone who associates with him is the same,” commented Deborah Leddon. “How low down and cowardly!” Bridges was reportedly travelling around 55 mph when he hit two wolves, killing at least one. The images have been reported to the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Park officials, who are investigating the incident. “We're trying to determine, first of all, what exactly we can do with something somebody says on Facebook with no other physical evidence,” Warden Capt. Joseph Jaquith told the Great Falls Tribune. “Whether or not it's true remains to be seen.” Bridges later claimed he was protecting a calf elk from the wolf and he drove by just in time. (Daily Mail) \\"Just past MM4 (mile maker 4), a cow elk and calf suddenly ran right out onto Interstate 90, and I let up on the gas and had just started to brake — in case more elk followed,\\" Bridges wrote. \\"What followed were two adult wolves. The cow jumped over the concrete barrier separating West and East traffic lanes, the calf stayed on 'my' side — and both were running up the highway, toward the pass. The wolves went after the calf ... and I let off the brake and hit the accelerator. I was going to save that calf.\\" \\"There was no time to hit the brakes (like I really would?) and I heard two distinct loud 'thumps,'\\" he added. He rounded the pass and saw “the dead wolf laid on the shoulder.” “I saw the other pup — dragging a broken leg — topping a steep bank about 80 or 90 yards upslope, just as it went back into the timber,” he added. “I thought about going up and putting the young wolf out of its misery…then I gave that second thought.

(Photo: Courtesy photo) Editor's note: What follows is a graphic description that may be difficult for some readers. A Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks law enforcement official said Friday the agency is \\"looking into\\" a Missoula anti-wolf extremist's Facebook claim that he purposefully ran down a pair of wolves on Interstate 90 just east of the Idaho-Montana border. Montana FWP Region 2 Warden Capt. Joseph Jaquith said they were aware of Toby Bridges' Facebook post in which he brags about killing two young wolves with his wife's van. \\"We're trying to determine, first of all, what exactly we can do with something somebody says on Facebook with no other physical evidence,\\" Jaquith said. \\"Whether or not it's true remains to be seen.\\" Bridges, who runs an anti-wolf website and Facebook page called Lobo Watch, on Tuesday posted pictures on Facebook and described in graphic detail how he accelerated his vehicle in an apparent attempt to intentionally run down the wolves. Bridges did not respond to an email seeking comment. Bridges described a scene in which he claims a group of wolves were chasing a cow and calf elk across the highway about four miles east of Lookout Pass. Bridges said he \\"let off the brake and hit the accelerator.\\" \\"Just past MM4 (mile maker 4), a cow elk and calf suddenly ran right out onto Interstate 90, and I let up on the gas and had just started to brake — in case more elk followed,\\" Bridges wrote. \\"What followed were two adult wolves. The cow jumped over the concrete barrier separating (sic) West and East traffic lanes, the calf stayed on 'my' side — and both were running up the highway, toward the pass. The wolves went after the calf ... and I let off the brake and hit the accelerator. I was going to save that calf.\\" Bridges said his vehicle was driving approximately 55 mph \\"when suddenly four young wolves shot right out in front of me. \\"There was no time to hit the brakes (like I really would?) and I heard two distinct loud 'thumps,'\\" Bridges wrote. \\"Out of my mirror, I saw an almost black 50-pound wolf spinning around in the middle of the highway — with one very apparent, very badly broken back leg. In the other mirror, I saw one slightly smaller wolf rolling onto the shoulder.\\" In graphic detail, Bridges described the scene and the sounds the badly injured wolves made in agony. \\"At the sound of the wolf pup with the broken leg squalling, the two adult wolves cut back across the highway in front of the van and shot up the side of the steep slope. I drove on to the pass, came back down the other side to where I could get back on the West bound lane, and came back to where the dead wolf laid on the shoulder. I saw the other pup — dragging a broken leg — topping a steep bank about 80 or 90 yards upslope, just as it went back into the timber. I thought about going up and putting the young wolf out of its misery…then I gave that second thought. The two adult wolves were still in the very close vicinity ... and I did not have a gun in the van.\\" According to his narrative, Bridges then pulled his vehicle over to take pictures of the scene. \\"While I snapped a few photos, I heard the pup howling in distress ... and a few minutes later I heard quite a ruckus up above ... then all went quiet. I do believe that the adult wolves finished off their severely injured offspring.\\" Early on in the post Bridges said he accelerated toward the wolves, but later claims striking the wolves with his car was an accident. \\"Two wolves out of the equation ... and it was all an accident. I love it when things go good,\\" Bridges wrote. Jaquith said \\"in general\\" it is illegal and \\"very unsporting\\" to intentionally run animals down with a vehicle. \\"It's very unsporting, regardless of how you feel about wolves or lawful means for harvest of wolves, certainly running them down on the highway is not what we would accept,\\" Jaquith said. Last year a federal prosecutor charged six members of a Montana Hutterite colony for killing and burying two grizzly bears after chasing them down in vehicles until the bears succumbed to exhaustion. The colony was fined nearly 20,000 in the deaths. Wolves are no longer managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services after they were removed from federal Endangered Species Act protections through a rider Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., attached to a 2011 budget bill. Brooks Fahy, of the national wildlife conservation organization Predator Defense, said Bridges' post is part of a growing online \\"subculture\\" of individuals who post graphic pictures and stories of predators being purposefully maimed, tortured and killed in online forums and on social media sites. In recent years, federal Forest Service and U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services agents have come under public scrutiny after posting graphic pictures online of wounded predators in traps. In one instance a federal Wildlife Services agent posted photos of his domestic dogs attacking a coyote caught in a leg-hold trap. \\"To me it's like a hate crime,\\" Fahy said. \\"You look at the language in these posts and it starts feeling very psychopathic. I'm very concerned about this.\\" Fahy also questioned whether state and federal wildlife protection and law enforcement agencies are doing enough to try to curb the illegal killing and torturing of wolves and other predators. Fahy said as the controversy surrounding wolves continues to build, wildlife agencies appear to be turning a blind eye to disturbing online posts. \\"This type of vitriol and hatred tends to build if it goes unchallenged,\\" Fahy said. \\"One thing that's very disconcerting so far in the Northern Rockies — Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming — is we're constantly hearing of animals being intentionally gut-shot, dead wolves being posed in disturbing position for photos. As far as I'm aware, none of these agencies, including Montana, have come out and publicly said, 'this is deplorable; this language is deplorable.'\\" Jaquith said FWP is taking the matter seriously, but at the same time he defended Bridges' \\"right to free speech.\\" \\"This is a very recent thing. We're not going to rush into it,\\" Jaquith said. \\"We're going to look at it, we're going to see exactly where it falls. We've had incidents where it takes a little bit of time to figure out what we're going to do about something. We're taking a look at it. We're not turning a blind eye to it.\\" Read or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/1sbheLK ||||| Anti-wolf hunter is now being investigated by Montana wildlife officials He teamed story with album of images showing two dead animals An anti-wolf hunter is being investigated by wildlife authorities after bragging about purposefully killing two animals - and posting a sick photo album of his conquests on Facebook. Toby Bridges runs a fan page called Lobo Watch in which he describes his plots to rid Montana of all its wolves. His latest post sparked outrage among the local community as it detailed the graphic manner in which he sped up his wife's van and ran over the young animals, leaving them for dead. Outrage: Toby Bridges is being investigated by authorities after describing accelerating to run over wolves To illustrate his story, Bridges posted four images of the wolves lying dead on the road, believed to be the Interstate 90. The incident has since been reported to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials, who are investigating the claims. 'We're trying to determine, first of all, what exactly we can do with something somebody says on Facebook with no other physical evidence,' Warden Capt Joseph Jaquith told the Great Falls Tribune.

They convey different events, as they detail different individuals resigning from the Knesset and the purpose of the resignation. Let's examine each sentence individually: 1. In October 2015, Shuli Mualem resigned from the Knesset in order to allow Bennett to take over his seat. This sentence is about Shuli Mualem, who decides to step down from their position at the Knesset in October 2015. The main reason for this resignation is to create an opportunity for Bennett to take Shuli Mualem's seat and become a Knesset member. In this scenario, Bennett gains a position in the Knesset due to Shuli Mualem's resignation. 2. In October 2015, Bennett resigned from the Knesset in order to enable Shuli Mualem to take his seat. In this second sentence, the roles are reversed. Bennett is the one who resigns from the Knesset in October 2015, leaving their seat open. The primary purpose of Bennett's resignation is to provide Shuli Mualem with the chance to join the Knesset and take Bennett's seat. In this context, Shuli Mualem gains a position in the Knesset as a result of Bennett's resignation. In summary, the two sentences describe different actions taken by Shuli Mualem and Bennett. In the first sentence, Shuli Mualem resigns to allow Bennett to take their seat in the Knesset, while in the second sentence, Bennett resigns to enable Shuli Mualem to take over their seat in the Knesset.

Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot. Jeff presents himself as happy-go-lucky and quite a joker, but others tend to see him as obnoxious and boorish.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: While originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching \\"Lost\\", I accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season 1the one with the polar-bearand it has had my undivided attention ever since. The show, that is. Not the polar bear. So bear (heh) with me while I throw out as much rambling, semi-coherent praise as I can muster. \\"Lost\\" takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island, and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchinglywhat drives them, who are they? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they're running away from something (Sawyer and Kate among others) or getting in touch with spirituality (Locke, Claire). But \\"Lost\\" also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses... and they all seem to be strangely connected. While television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities, most of the cast of \\"Lost\\" are, in truth, spectacular actors for their respective parts, projecting heart and humour in their performances. There's also a multitude of eyecandy, but not generally of the plastic Hollywood kind as most TV shows. The characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch. Their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness, petty arguments or cheesy melodrama (although they are annoyingly secretive)  these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action. The realism of these characters facilitate an already well-sculptured plot. About this plot... Imagine a tree as the template plot, then the branches as subplots (in this case, one branch for every character)  well, Lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines. If you're a brother/sister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks, you will get your own storyline. If you're a DOG you will have your own storyline. Unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end, they are setting themselves up. I am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing cop-out to this show, as I'm sure most people are. But assuming the writers do pull this off, \\"Lost\\" is possibly the best show ever to hit television. 9/10 OPTIONS: A). negative. B). positive.","completion":"B). Positive. The reviewer expresses significant praise for the television show \\"Lost\\", citing aspects such as the depth of character exploration, quality of acting, the believable realism of the characters, and the appealing complexity of the storyline. The reviewer even suggests that if the show's writers effectively manage the plot, \\"Lost\\" could be considered the best show ever to hit television. These aspects indicate a strong positive sentiment towards the show. However, it should be noted that the reviewer does express some minor concerns towards the potential downfall of the plot if it's not properly concluded, hinting at a bit of hesitance. Yet, this doesn't outweigh the pervasive positivity in the review. Therefore, based on the predominantly positive comments and the overall rating of 9/10, the correct sentiment of this review is positive."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: who is hope to bring Butch in alive?

With a large bounty on his head, many have tried – and failed – to bring him in alive. That's when Red \\"Shadows\\" O'Reilly, a hardened and skilled bounty hunter with a personal vendetta, enters the fray. Red's motivation to bring Butch in alive stems from the fact that Butch had killed his younger brother during a vicious armed robbery years ago. Red has always harbored guilt for not being able to protect his brother, and he believes capturing Butch and bringing him to justice can finally provide closure to his haunted past. As Red carefully gathers information about Butch's gang, plans their every move, and enlists the assistance of other bounty hunters with their own unique skills, he uncovers a hidden side to Butch that makes him question everything he thought he knew about the infamous outlaw. It turns out that Butch has been secretly funding an orphanage with his stolen money, inspiring loyalty and creating a generation of followers. Despite his newfound knowledge of Butch's altruistic actions, Red remains focused on his mission, inspired by the spirit of his deceased brother. After numerous intense shootouts, betrayals, and unexpected alliances, Red finally captures Butch, but not without questioning his own beliefs and values. The film culminates in a dramatic courthouse showdown where Red stands as a witness to Butch's sentence. He must battle with the moral questions of whether justice is being served and if his personal desire for vengeance is justified. In the end, Red chooses to walk away from his career as a bounty hunter, realizing that revenge isn't the answer to finding peace with his past.

OPTIONS: [-] no; [-] yes;","completion":"To answer your third question first, those questions are not exactly the same, but they are closely related. So, [-] no, they're not the same. Here, I will provide a step-by-step guide to being innovative and thinking innovatively: Step 1: Be open-minded To think innovatively, you have to be willing to question your assumptions and be open to new ideas and perspectives. Cultivate a mindset of curiosity and be receptive to change. Step 2: Expand your knowledge base The more you know, the more connections you can make between seemingly unrelated ideas and concepts. Try learning about different subjects, industries, and cultures. Read books, attend webinars, and seek out diverse perspectives. Step 3: Observe and identify problems Innovation often begins by observing and identifying problems or areas of improvement in everyday life, work, or society. Pay close attention to the world around you and consider potential ways to address the challenges you encounter. Step 4: Use brainstorming techniques Once you've identified a problem, use brainstorming techniques to generate innovative solutions. For example, mind mapping, rapid ideation sessions, or the \\"six thinking hats\\" method can help you think creatively. Step 5: Challenge the status quo Sometimes, traditional methods or solutions might not be the best option. If you find yourself stuck on a problem or in a rut, ask yourself what you can do differently or if there's a better way to approach the situation. Step 6: Collaborate with others Innovation often comes from collaboration. Work with others who have different skill sets, backgrounds, and perspectives to create a diverse environment. This fusion of different ideas and skills can lead to innovative solutions. Step 7: Experiment and iterate Innovation involves trial and error. Test your ideas, learn from your mistakes, and make adjustments as needed. This is an essential part of the innovation process, as learning from your failures can inform future success. Step 8: Foster a culture of innovation Surround yourself with an environment that encourages innovation. Support others' ideas and give them space to explore and grow, and look for inspiration from various sources. By following these steps, you'll be on your way to thinking innovatively and embracing innovation in your personal and professional life."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Answer the question below: If Mona is comparing fossils she found in very old rocks to fossils she found in newer rocks.

Both the original and this remake were (allegedly) shot in one take with no actual cuts or edits with a single camera, similar to the 1948 experimental film 'Rope' by Alfred Hitchcock.We begin with an overhead shot of a young woman, Sarah (Elizabeth Olsen) sitting on some rocks in a lake. As she gets off and begins to hop among the rocks back to the shore, the camera descends and begins following Sarah in real-time. She walks up to an obviously dilapidated house. The house is three stories tall and has red-brick exteriors with all of the windows boarded up. Sarah's father John (Adam Trese) meets her near the front steps and tells her sternly to pick up the gardening tools lying about. John then asks Sarah about her Facebook profile, and she admits that her ex-boyfriend may want to get back together with her, much to John's disapproval.John's younger brother and Sarah's Uncle Peter (Eric Sheffer Stevens) walks through the front door and greets the two of them. He says that there is a big problem in the house. They walk in, and though it is daylight outside, the house is almost pitch black as all the windows are boarded. The trio turn on their electric lanterns and follow Peter to the dining room (the source of the problem) where John hits the wall with a sledgehammer to reveal that mold has grown within the walls, and maybe throughout the entire house. Tools and clutter are strewn everywhere. They take a picture of the mold with their polaroid camera and after her father walks out of the room Peter stares at Sarah, telling her how beautiful of a woman she has become. After they enter the living room, John and Peter then leave to go into another part of the house, and Sarah starts up the stairs when she hears a knock at the front door.She opens the door to see a girl roughly her age standing on the porch.

Connan befriends subotai.","completion":"Title: Chronicle of the Unbreakable Bond Genre: Action, Adventure, Drama Plot Summary: In a time when kingdoms and empires clash with sword and sorcery, Connan, the last survivor of his bloodline, sets forth on a quest to avenge the brutal massacre of his people by the vicious warlord, Thulsa Do'rak. Along the way, Connan befriends an enigmatic thief, Subotai, and the two of them embark on a dangerous journey through war-torn lands and mythical realms filled with unimaginable creatures, ferocious battles, and legends of old. Act 1: In the aftermath of the violent raid that leaves his village in ruins and his entire clan slaughtered, Connan barely escapes with his life. Now an orphan, he is taken in by a hermit who teaches him about herbs, healing arts, and other practical skills. Among the ravines and hills, Connan grows up to be strong and resourceful with intense hatred for Do'rak and a burning desire to take revenge. Years later, a chance encounter with a group of thieves leads Connan to Subotai, a skilled archer and thief with a sharp wit and unmatched agility. Initially cautious of each other, the two eventually gain each other's trust and form an unbreakable bond of friendship. Subotai shares his knowledge of the world, and together they hone their skills in combat and survival, all the while plotting their revenge on Do'rak and his ruthless empire. Act 2: As Connan and Subotai travel across the lands, they encounter various groups of people, some helpful, some hostile. Among them, a blind oracle predicts a great fate awaiting the duo, and a warrior princess named Valeria who aids them in their journey; she is captivated by Connan's iron will and unwavering sense of justice. The trio encounters a number of ordeals that test their limits, including battling supernatural beasts, traversing perilous landscapes, and facing off against a band of mercenaries sent by Do'rak upon learning about Connan's intentions. Connan and Subotai, along with Valeria, display great teamwork, loyalty, and the essence of true friendship, standing by each other through thick and thin. Act 3: As the trio uncover the whereabouts of Do'rak's stronghold—a fortress hidden within the nearly impenetrable, treacherous Labyrinth of Shadows, they discover that to reach and defeat their nemesis, they must liberate four relics known as the \\"Pillars of Eternity\\" scattered across the land. These relics hold the power to dissolve the ancient ward guarding the entrance of the Labyrinth. Connan, Subotai, and Valeria confront a series of challenges as they each face a task to retrieve a relic of their own. Their friendship and individual strengths are put to the test, but their unwavering determination to avenge the innocents slaughtered by Do'rak and to end his reign of terror bind them together in an unbreakable bond. The climax of the movie unfolds as our heroes assemble the Pillars of Eternity and unlock the hidden door to the Labyrinth of Shadows. They battle their way through the fortress filled with monstrous guards and lethal traps. Finally, they confront the warlord, Thulsa Do'rak, and after an epic battle filled with blood, sweat, and tears, ultimately emerge victorious. Epilogue: In the end, Connan, Subotai, and Valeria dismantle Do'rak's empire, liberating the people who once lived under his rule. Our protagonists deviate from their separate paths, enriched by the bonds forged on their remarkable journey and each embarking on their own path of adventure. The movie ends with a narration that these tales of the unbreakable bond between Connan and Subotai will echo through the annals of time—stories of friendship, loyalty, and courage in the face of adversity, forever reminding us of what it means to be human."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the subject whose identification with the cathedral itself is emphasized by her monumental stature? Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling...

Determine the purpose: First, you need to identify the specific purpose for which you need the parchment paper. Parchment paper is commonly used for baking, cooking, arts and crafts, or calligraphy. Knowing the purpose will help you make informed decisions about the type and size of parchment paper you require. 2. Research the type of parchment paper: There are different types of parchment paper available in the market, such as bleached or unbleached and silicone-coated or quilon-coated. Each type has its own benefits. Silicone-coated parchment paper is food-safe and heat-resistant, making it suitable for baking and cooking. Quilon-coated parchment paper is also food-safe but may contain trace amounts of heavy metals, which could make it less desirable for cooking. 3. Check if there are substitutes: It is possible that you have some parchment paper substitutes available at your disposal, like aluminum foil, wax paper, or a silicone baking mat. Identifying potential substitutes can help save time and energy if you cannot obtain parchment paper. 4. Decide on the size and quantity: Depending on the purpose, you may need parchment paper in pre-cut sheets, a roll of parchment paper, or parchment circles for cake pans. Parchment rolls typically come in widths of 12-15 inches, and you can cut them to the desired length. Pre-cut sheets come in standard sizes, such as 8.5x11 inches or 11x17 inches. Make a note of the dimensions and quantity you'll need. 5. Determine your budget: Set a budget for purchasing parchment paper. Pricing can vary depending on factors such as the brand, quality, and where you purchase it from. 6. Locate stores or online platforms: Look for local grocery stores, supermarkets, or specialty cooking stores in your area that sell parchment paper. Alternatively, find online platforms like Amazon, Walmart, or Target, where you can purchase parchment paper. Compare prices, customer reviews, and shipping options on the available parchment paper products before making your final purchase decision. 7. Purchasing parchment paper: Once you've found a suitable product that meets your requirements, budget, and delivery options, proceed to purchase the parchment paper. In a physical store, locate the aisle where parchment paper is stocked, pick up the desired product, and make the payment at the checkout counter.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the scientific name of the kongoni? , can you please find it? The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. and the situation: Mike is studying the predator prey relationship. He is specifically studying three species, species A, species B, and species C. Species A is a predator; species B is the prey; and species C is a plant species that species B lives on. Mike now needs to figure out how the predator prey relationship balance the ecosystem. Answer the following question: If species B population increase, would species C population increase or decrease? Answer:","completion":"If the population of species B (the prey) increases, then the population of species C (the plant species that species B lives on) would likely decrease. This is because species B would consume more of species C as its population grows, putting more pressure on the plant species and potentially reducing its overall population in the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Wrap your lobster in a few layers of cool, damp—not dripping wet—newspaper. Cool water will keep your lobster's metabolism low so they remain docile and sluggish. Dry lobsters are more likely to die before you're ready to prepare them. Use saltwater to dampen the newspapers. Tap water can kill your lobster. Containers with a simple opening, like a cooler or a cardboard box, work well for storing lobsters. Store 1 or 2 lobsters in the container at a time to avoid contention between your lobsters. The colder your lobster is, the less it will move. If you do not use a cooler to store your lobster, add in at least 1 or 2 ice packs. Make enough room for your lobster's container and slide it carefully into the fridge. If possible, put it in the darkest or coolest corner of the fridge to keep your lobster's metabolism down. Lobsters with a low metabolism move and struggle less. Set a timer for 5-6 hours and, when the timer goes off, remove your lobster from the container to check its newspaper wrapping. If the newspaper is dry or warm, change the newspapers for new, damp wrapping. Do not keep your lobster out on the counter for any longer than a few minutes. Storing your lobster at room temperature can dry out your lobster's wrapping and cause premature death.

Hypothesis: All of the land drained by a river system is called its basin, or the \\"wet\\" term watershed Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Read and understand the Premise and Hypothesis. Premise: A watershed is a dynamic system that includes the area of land delineated by the drainage basin, its aquatic components (streams and rivers, agricultural drains, lakes and ponds, riparian zones, and wetlands), and its plant and animal life. Hypothesis: All of the land drained by a river system is called its basin, or the \\"wet\\" term watershed. Step 2: Identify the key components of the Premise and Hypothesis. Premise: - Watershed is a dynamic system - Components: area of land delineated by the drainage basin, aquatic components (streams, rivers, drains, lakes, ponds, riparian zones, wetlands), plant and animal life Hypothesis: - Land drained by river system - Called basin or \\"wet\\" term watershed Step 3: Analyze the information provided in the Premise and compare it with the claim made in the Hypothesis. The Premise states that a watershed is a dynamic system that includes the area of land delineated by the drainage basin, along with its aquatic components, plant, and animal life. The Hypothesis claims that all of the land drained by a river system is called its basin, or the \\"wet\\" term watershed. Step 4: Determine if the Premise entails or supports the Hypothesis. The Premise provides enough information about a watershed and its components to support the claim made in the Hypothesis that the land drained by a river system is called its basin or watershed. The Premise explains that a watershed includes the area of land delineated by the drainage basin, which corresponds to the land drained by a river system as stated in the Hypothesis.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What college is the only project Austen Harrison ever did in Britain? from the following article ? Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

Beginning in the lush paradise of Edenia, Princess Aria is blissfully unaware of the ever-looming darkness on the horizon. However, her life is turned upside down when she stumbles upon her father, the King, discussing with his closest advisors the worrying news regarding Shao Kahn's plans to invade their realm and claim its throne. Aria's father reveals that the emblems protecting Edenia's borders have gradually been destroyed by Shao Kahn's minions, increasing the risk of invasion. As the tension between the realms escalates, Aria, seeking to save her homeland, embarks on an epic adventure with her closest friends and skilled warriors - Kai, a firebender, and Zara, a master archer. Their mission is to seek the Guardians of the Elements, powerful, ancient beings that were once entrusted to protect and guide the denizens of Edenia. Aria aims to rekindle the Guardians' allegiance and create a formidable force against Shao Kahn and defend Edenia. Throughout their journey, Aria's team encounters various mystical creatures who join their quest, intrigued by the embers of hope in their resilient hearts. As the group faces perilous trials and battles against Shao Kahn's forces, they uncover a secret, ancient prophecy.

Driven by this newfound knowledge, the young heroes grow stronger in their resolve and continue their quest. Along the way, they discover that Shao Kahn was once a benevolent and just ruler. However, he was deceived and corrupted by a rogue sorcerer, Quan Chi, whose ulterior motives are to gain control of Outworld and its armies for himself. In the climactic final battle, Aria's team, backed by the Guardians of the Elements and their realm allies, come face-to-face with Shao Kahn's forces on the battlefield. As the stakes are higher than ever, Aria confronts both Shao Kahn and Quan Chi in a thrilling conflict. She compels Shao Kahn to recognize his inner nobility and break free from Quan Chi's malicious influence. The combined forces of Aria and the redeemed Shao Kahn turn on Quan Chi, ultimately defeating him and restoring peace to both realms.

I prefer the old cell phones compared to new cell phones because the","completion":"old cell phones had a certain charm and simplicity to them. They were built to last, with sturdy buttons and a compact design that made them easy to carry around. The battery life was phenomenal and would hold its charge for days without the need for constant recharging. Plus, there was something deeply satisfying about the tactile feedback of pressing actual buttons, as opposed to tapping on a digital screen. Step 1: Establish the setting and narrator's perspective I introduced the old cell phones and their key features from the narrator's point of view, highlighting their charm, sturdiness, and battery life. Step 2: Introduce a nostalgic sentiment I emphasized the satisfaction derived from using actual buttons which not only evokes nostalgia but also allows a direct comparison with modern touchscreen phones. Nowadays, smartphones have become a necessity for most people. They perform countless tasks, far surpassing the abilities of old cell phones. Yet, there are still moments when I find myself longing for the good old days. I remember spending hours playing 'Snake,' a simple yet addictive game that captivated users for hours on end. There was also the unparalleled satisfaction of composing a text message using T9 predictive text, mastering the art of shortening words while still retaining their meaning. Step 3: Acknowledge modern advancements I acknowledged the benefits and capabilities of modern smartphones, establishing a contrast with the simplicity of old cell phones. Step 4: Express deeper nostalgia and reminiscence I delved into reminiscing about popular activities, such as playing 'Snake' and composing messages through T9 predictive text, which were characteristic and enjoyable aspects of old cell phones. In a world where everything is rapidly advancing, I sometimes feel an overwhelming sense of information overload. Constant notifications, endless apps, and the intrusive nature of social media can, at times, make modern smartphones draining and stressful. It's in these moments that I truly appreciate the simplicity and straightforwardness of my old cell phone. Step 5: Establish emotional appeal and juxtaposition I described the overwhelming nature of smartphones, creating a juxtaposition between the calm and simple experiences provided by old cell phones and the stress-inducing aspects of modern technology. As technology continues to evolve, I understand that these old cell phones will likely become obsolete and forgotten. However, there will always be a special place in my heart for the reliable, tactile, and undeniably nostalgic experience of using an old cell phone. Step 6: Conclude the story by accepting the passage of time I accepted the fact that old cell phones will likely be replaced by newer technologies but reinforced the lasting emotional impact they have on the narrator. All in all, by understanding the emotions and reasoning behind the preference for old cell phones, the story emphasizes nostalgia, simplicity, and the longing for a seemingly less-complicated time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Problem:This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and I really think that this film might just be the worst of them all--yet it wasn't just a nominee but it won!! I assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre.The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super-skinny Uncle Festers. The appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation. All are identical--with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs. They are all standing on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space. Each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform. The platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform. This goes on and on and on and on for the longest time. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end, but it just isn't enough to make this fun to watch in the least. Aside from passable stop motion animation, this short offers nothing of interest to me....NOTHING.By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees. It was a GREAT short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it. Could Pixar have not entered it?

Information: - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia . It contains two species , which both are critically endangered : Huso dauricus ( Georgi , 1775 ) ( kaluga ) Huso huso ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) ( beluga ) Recent data indicate a polyphyletic origin of the genus Huso , and it is suggested that the two Huso species should be included in the genus Acipenser .

In the first quarter, Denver was first out of the gate as FB Michael Pittman got a 1-yard TD run. The Chargers would respond with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 34-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Denver replied with QB Jay Cutler completing a 3-yard and a 14-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler. San Diego would immediately respond with RB Darren Sproles returning the kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown, yet the Broncos replied with rookie kicker Matt Prater getting a 52-yard field goal. The Chargers would strike as their lead as QB Philip Rivers completed a 48-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers, yet Denver retaliated with Cutler completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall. In the third quarter, San Diego started to rally as Rivers completed a 15-yard TD pass to Chambers, and Kaeding kicked a 21-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Chargers took the lead with Kaeding's 28-yard field goal and Rivers' 66-yard TD pass to Sproles. Fortunately, the Broncos responded with a 12-play, 80-yard drive (which included a controversial officiating call that turned a Cutler fumble into an incomplete pass) that was capped off with Cutler's 4-yard TD pass to rookie WR Eddie Royal, followed by Cutler's successful 2-point conversion pass to Royal. Brandon Marshall's 18 receptions would become a single-game franchise record and tie for 2nd most in league history.

The shortest field goal is 21 yards, which happened in the third quarter. So, the difference of yards between Kaeding's longest and shortest field goal is: 34 yards (longest) - 21 yards (shortest) = 13 yards.

A Democrat from Texas, he also served as a United States Representative and as the Majority Leader in the United States Senate. Johnson is one of only four people who have served in all four federal elected positions. In 1964, at Johnson's request, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1964 and the Economic Opportunity Act, as part of the war on poverty. Johnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as Head Start, food stamps and Work Study. During Johnson's years in office, national poverty declined significantly, with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 percent to 12 percent. Johnson took an additional step in the War on Poverty with an urban renewal effort, presenting to Congress in January 1966 the \\"Demonstration Cities Program\\". To be eligible a city would need to demonstrate its readiness to \\"arrest blight and decay and make substantial impact on the development of its entire city.\\" Johnson requested an investment of 400 million per year totaling 2.4 billion. In the fall of 1966 the Congress passed a substantially reduced program costing 900 million, which Johnson later called the Model Cities Program. Changing the name had little effect on the success of the bill; the New York Times wrote 22 years later that the program was for the most part a failure. Johnson's initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Strokes (HDCS). Combined, these diseases accounted for 71 percent of the nation's deaths in 1962. To enact recommendations of the commission, Johnson asked Congress for funds to set up the Regional Medical Program (RMP), to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice; Congress passed a significantly watered down version. As a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security. The key player in initiating this program, named Medicare, was Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. In order to reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cake--hospital insurance under Social Security, a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as Medicaid. The bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated; however, the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee. Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans. Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President Harry S Truman and his wife Bess after signing the Medicare bill at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri.

Summarize this article: Parenting skills, like any other ability, can be learned. Taking parenting classes can help you learn what you’ll need to know and do as you prepare for the arrival of a newborn. Most classes cover changing diapers, bathing, burping, and feeding your baby, among other skills. For a unique bonding experience, attend these classes with your partner. Books that offer advice to expectant parents (and, especially, books targeted specifically towards men) can offer valuable insights and information. Many of these books are available at your local library, though you could of course buy them, too. Focus on learning practical skills like how to calm a crying baby. When your partner goes to the doctor for checkups and ultrasounds, tag along. Listen to the doctor’s advice. Write down information about what the birth process will entail and how you can prepare for the newborn’s arrival. Talk to your partner about where they want you to be during labor. Some expectant mothers want their partners in the birthing room during labor. Others expect their partner to remain outside. There is no right way for a couple to plan this experience, but you should discuss the options together and come to an agreement. If you’re invited into the birthing room, you’ll probably just be there to squeeze your partner’s hand and offer moral support.

On 5 September 2003, Mui publicly announced that she had cervical cancer, from which her sister had also died. She held a series of eight shows at the Hong Kong Coliseum from 6-11 November and 14-15 November 2003, which were to be her last concerts before her death. Her symbolic act was to \\"marry the stage\\", which was accompanied by her hit song \\"Sunset Melody\\" (Xi Yang Zhi Ge ) as she exited the stage. The last song she performed on stage was \\"Cherish When We Meet Again\\" (Zhen Xi Zai Hui Shi ), a rendition of The Manhattans' \\"Let's Just Kiss And Say Goodbye\\" on 15 November 2003, where she was accompanied by her friends on the stage. She eventually succumbed to cervical cancer and died of respiratory complications leading to lung failure at Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital on 30 December 2003 at 02:50 (HK local time).

This establishes a common topic in both sentences. 2.

Kerry's approach: In the first sentence, Kerry is described as pursuing a 'quiet strategy,' which indicates that he's working on the peace process discreetly or without making a lot of noise. In the second sentence, it is noted that Kerry is meeting with Israeli leaders, a direct and public effort to push forward the Mideast peace process. Although these specifics differ, the overall implication in both sentences is that Kerry is involved in diplomatic efforts to further the peace process in the Mideast. The reason why the similarity is not a perfect 5 is because the two sentences do not convey the exact same information.

Write an article that answers the following question: Were more of Iran's population on fixed-line phones or mobile phones in 2010?","completion":"Title: Fixed-line vs. Mobile Phone Usage in Iran in 2010 Introduction Telecommunications in Iran, like in many other developing countries, has witnessed rapid growth in recent years. The transition from fixed-line phones to mobile phones has been particularly noticeable as people search for more effective ways to communicate in an increasingly digital world. The question at hand is whether fixed-line phone usage or mobile phone usage was more prevalent in Iran's population in 2010. Background To address this question, it's essential to take a look at the telecommunications landscape in Iran at the time. In the early 2000s, access to phone services was limited, but the Iranian government soon undertook ambitious projects to expand the country's telecommunications infrastructure. Consequently, both fixed-line and mobile phone subscriptions increased, greatly enhancing the accessibility of phone services to the population. Methodology To make an accurate comparison between fixed-line and mobile phone usage among Iran's population in 2010, various factors were considered, including data from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), government and industry reports, as well as historical trends. Results According to a report from the ITU, fixed-line phone subscriptions in Iran reached 27 million by the end of 2010, representing a penetration rate of 36.2% in a population of around 73 million. In the same timeframe, the number of mobile phone subscriptions surpassed 65 million, accounting for a penetration rate of approximately 89.1%. In other words, almost nine in every ten people in Iran had a mobile phone, while slightly more than a third had access to a fixed-line phone. Discussion The higher prevalence of mobile phones, compared with fixed-line phones, can be attributed to a variety of factors. One of the primary reasons is the superior flexibility and mobility offered by mobile phones, which allow users to communicate and access the internet on the go. Additionally, mobile phone technology experienced rapid advancements during the latter part of the 2000s, putting mobile phones at the forefront of telecommunications trends. Moreover, Iran's government introduced policies to promote and invest in mobile phone services, such as allocating resources to expand network coverage and offering concessional loans to encourage private companies to enter the market. These initiatives led to increased competition, which in turn resulted in lower prices and attractive offers for consumers, further driving the surge in mobile phone adoption in Iran. Conclusion The analysis of available data and factors influencing the telecommunications industry in Iran during 2010 clearly shows that mobile phones were more prevalent among the population than fixed-line phones. This marked shift toward mobile phone usage can be attributed to the technological advancements, government policies, and increased accessibility that accompanied the rapid expansion of the mobile phone industry. As we continue into the digital age, it is evident that mobile phones have become a preferred mode of communication for many people worldwide, and the case of Iran in 2010 was no exception."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ellington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias. From 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \\"Jeep's Blues\\" for Johnny Hodges, \\"Yearning for Love\\" for Lawrence Brown, \\"Trumpet in Spades\\" for Rex Stewart, \\"Echoes of Harlem\\" for Cootie Williams and \\"Clarinet Lament\\" for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year. After leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the William Morris Agency. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels, the small groups had recorded for the latter, collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \\"Caravan\\" in 1937, and \\"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\\" the following year. Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed \\"Swee' Pea\\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, \\"my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine\\". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or \\"Duke's doppelganger\\". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio. The 1930s ended with a very successful European tour just as World War II loomed in Europe. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Any other aspects of his career happen during this time frame?","completion":"In the provided text, several aspects of Ellington's career between 1936 and the late 1930s are given. Here are few of them: 1. He began making recordings with smaller groups - sextets, octets, and nonets - derived from his fifteen-man orchestra, and began composing pieces intended to spotlight specific instrumentalists. These compositions include \\"Jeep's Blues\\" for Johnny Hodges, \\"Yearning for Love\\" for Lawrence Brown, \\"Trumpet in Spades\\" for Rex Stewart, \\"Echoes of Harlem\\" for Cootie Williams, and \\"Clarinet Lament\\" for Barney Bigard. 2. In 1937, he returned to the relocated Cotton Club in the Theatre District and faced financial struggles after his father's death, until his situation improved the next year. 3. He left agent Irving Mills and joined the William Morris Agency. However, Mills continued to record his music. When Mills' labels folded in 1937, he put Ellington back on Brunswick and the small group units on the Vocalion label. 4. He produced well-known pieces like \\"Caravan\\" in 1937 and \\"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\\" in 1938. 5. Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist in 1939, became a pivotal part of the Ellington organization and often stepped in for Duke in a variety of roles, including conducting, rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage or in recording sessions. 6. He ended the 1930s with successful European tours just before the start of World War II."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. Now, I have a new situation: Mark decides he want a cold drink and puts a bottle of warm water in his freezer. By doing this he makes the water colder and as water cools its density increases eventually freezing and becoming a solid, Ice. After a while mark forgets that he put the bottle of water in the freezer. He eventually remembers and comes back to check and the bottle of water is frozen solid. Because of this he leaves the bottle out on his kitchen counter for a few hours and returns to a nice cold bottle of water.

Summarize this article in one sentence. You'll need a large glass jar that can hold at least a quart (4 cups). The jar should have a sealable lid since you'll be storing the brandy in it and shaking it frequently. Place 2 cups (44g) of blackberries into your clean jar and smash them a little with the end of a wooden spoon to release some juice. If you like your blackberry brandy to be a little tart, add 1/2\\" piece of lime zest to the jar. Buy an unflavored vodka and brandy. Any quality brandy will work when making homemade blackberry brandy, especially if you let the blackberries infuse the alcohol for several months. Pour 3/4 cup (177 ml) of brandy and 1 1/4 (355 ml) cup of vodka into your jar with the muddled blackberries. For a stronger brandy flavor, you can replace the vodka with more brandy or even whisky, rum, or gin. Seal the jar with your berries, vodka, and brandy. Shake the mixture and let it sit for 3 days. Avoid refrigerating it and keep it out of direct sunlight. After 3 days, pour the brandy mixture through a strainer lined with cheesecloth. This will catch any blackberry solids. You can throw away the blackberry solids since they'll mainly be seeds. Mix 1 cup (235 ml) of water with 1 cup (200g) of granulated sugar in a small saucepan. Cook it over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Refrigerate the syrup until it's cool. Add all of the cold simple syrup to your strained blackberry brandy. If you want to make extra simple syrup to further sweeten the brandy or to use in other drinks, you can double the water and sugar. Refrigerate your extra simple syrup for up to 5 days. Shake the jar so that the simple syrup and blackberry brandy completely mix. Let it rest for at least 1 day after you add the syrup. You can then serve the blackberry brandy or mix it into a cocktail. Refrigerate your blackberry brandy for up to 2 months.","completion":"This article describes the process of making homemade blackberry brandy by infusing blackberries with vodka and brandy, adding simple syrup, and letting it rest before enjoying it in cocktails or on its own."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He did not have a rich family. He was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Instead,my friend was always hard up for cash. He did not have much money. And the money he did earn was chicken feed -- very little. Sometimes Al even had to accept handouts,gifts from his family and friends. But do not get me wrong. My friend was not a deadbeat. He was not the kind of person who never paid the money he owed. He simply _ pennies. He was always very careful with the money he spent. In fact,he was often a cheapskate. He did not like to spend money. The worst times were when he was flat broke and had no money at all. One day,Al scraped together a few dollars for a lottery ticket. He thought he would never strike it rich or gain lots of money unexpectedly. But his combination of numbers was chosen and he won the lottery. He hit the jackpot. He won a great deal of money. Al was so excited. The first thing he did was buy a costly new ear. He splurged on the one thing that he normally would not buy. Then he started spending money on unnecessary things. He started to waste it. It was like he had money to burn. He had more money than he needed and it was burning a hole in his pocket so he spent it quickly. When we got together for a meal at a restaurant,Al paid every time. He would always foot the bill,and pick up the tab. He told me the money made him feel like a million dollars. He was very happy. But,Al spent too much money. Soon my friend was down and out again. He had no money left. He was back to being strapped for cash. He had spent his bottom dollar, his very last amount. He did not even build up a nest egg. He had not saved any of the money. I admit I do feel sorry for my friend. He had enough money to live like a king. Instead,he is back to living on a shoestring--a very low budget. Some might say he is penny wise and pound foolish. He is wise about small things,but not about important things. Why did A1 live a poor life again after he won the lottery? A) Because he lost a lot of money he had won. B) Because he spent much money freely on unnecessary things.

Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society. In 1919, he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation, and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters. At an international convention held at Cedar Point, Ohio, in September 1922, a new emphasis was made on house-to-house preaching. Significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during Rutherford's twenty-five years as president, including the 1920 announcement that the Jewish patriarchs (such as Abraham and Isaac) would be resurrected in 1925, marking the beginning of Christ's thousand-year Kingdom. Disappointed by the changes, tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford's tenure, leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society, most of which still exist. By mid-1919, as many as one in seven of Russell-era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society, and as many as two-thirds by the end of the 1920s.

This upbringing shaped Filion into a self-reliant individual with strong entrepreneurial spirit, a passion for journalism, and an unwavering commitment to community development. Gérard Filion's career took off when he entered the world of international business. His first foray into business began in the agricultural sector, where he developed an in-depth understanding of the many challenges faced by farmers and the importance of advocating for their rights and needs. This early experience equipped Filion with essential business acumen, a keen interest in social justice, and an unyielding dedication to strengthening the economic and social well-being of rural communities. As Filion's business ventures expanded, he began to explore another passion – journalism. With a keen sense of observation and the ability to eloquently articulate complex information, Filion found journalism to be a natural space where he could voice the concerns of his fellow compatriots, share ideas, and stimulate public debate on key socioeconomic issues. One of his most notable career achievements was the founding of the French-language Canadian daily newspaper, \\"Le Devoir\\". Under Filion's leadership as its director, \\"Le Devoir\\" became one of the most influential newspapers in Quebec. It gave voice to the province's rapidly growing and diversifying population, who clamored for increased self-determination and cultural identity. Under Filion's guidance, \\"Le Devoir\\" shed light on critical issues, such as rural prosperity, economic development, education, and healthcare, which were often overlooked elsewhere. Filion was also deeply committed to improving the lives of those he served throughout his career. He was known for his empathetic and genuine concern for the well-being of his fellow citizens. He went beyond his journalistic duties and used his influence to advance important social causes, reflecting his belief in the importance of community involvement and social responsibility. On a personal level, Gérard Filion was married to Françoise Servêtre, with whom he shared his life and engaged in a partnership built on mutual respect, support, and shared values. Their union undoubtedly strengthened their commitment to the pursuit of social justice and the improvement of the lives of the people they served. Gérard Filion passed away on March 26, 2005, leaving an enduring legacy rooted in perseverance, ingenuity, and compassion. As a pioneering businessman and journalist, Filion inspired future generations to step up, seize opportunities, and serve as advocates for change in their communities. Today, his life's work and contributions continue to be remembered and celebrated in Quebec and beyond."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Read this and answer the question In response to the criticism of the Kinsey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation, Fritz Klein developed the Klein sexual orientation grid (KSOG), a multidimensional scale for describing sexual orientation. Introduced in Klein's book The Bisexual Option, the KSOG uses a 7-point scale to assess seven different dimensions of sexuality at three different points in an individual's life: past (from early adolescence up to one year ago), present (within the last 12 months), and ideal (what would you choose if it were completely your choice).

How to make a Denver Omelet at home.","completion":"Making a Denver Omelet at home is a delicious and satisfying meal that can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. A Denver Omelet, also known as a Western Omelet, typically consists of diced ham, onions, green bell peppers, and cheese, all cooked together with beaten eggs. The following is a step-by-step guide to help you create a fantastic Denver Omelet: Ingredients: - 4 large eggs - 1/3 cup diced ham - 1/4 cup diced green bell pepper - 1/4 cup diced onion - 1/2 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or Swiss, or a combination) - 2 tablespoons milk or cream (optional, for fluffier eggs) - Salt and pepper to taste - 1-2 tablespoons butter or oil - Optional: hot sauce or salsa, for serving Instructions: 1. Prepare ingredients: Dice the ham, bell pepper, and onion into small pieces. Shred the cheese if it's not already shredded. 2. Beat the eggs: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, crack the eggs and beat them until the yolks and whites are well combined. If you'd like a fluffier omelet, add 2 tablespoons of milk or cream and whisk until fully incorporated. Season the eggs with salt and pepper to taste. 3. Cook the vegetables: Heat 1 tablespoon of butter or oil in a non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once the butter has melted or the oil is hot and shimmering, add the diced onions and green bell peppers. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onions are translucent and the peppers are slightly softened. 4. Cook the ham: Add the diced ham to the skillet and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the ham is heated through and beginning to brown. 5. Add the eggs: Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet, ensuring that they evenly cover the vegetables and ham. You may need to gently tilt the pan or use a spatula to spread the eggs evenly. 6. Add the cheese: Sprinkle the shredded cheese evenly over the egg mixture. As the eggs cook, use a spatula to lift the edges and allow any uncooked egg to flow beneath, so it's cooked evenly. Cook for about 4-5 minutes, or until the eggs are almost set but still slightly soft on top. 7. Fold the omelet: Using a spatula, carefully fold one side of the omelet over the other half, creating a half-moon shape. 8. Finish and serve: Let the omelet cook for another 1-2 minutes to allow the cheese to melt and the eggs to fully set. Carefully slide the omelet onto a plate, and serve immediately. If desired, top with hot sauce or salsa for an extra kick of flavor. With this recipe, you can easily create a mouth-watering Denver Omelet in the comfort of your own home. Feel free to get creative and add additional ingredients or substitute other types of vegetables, meats, or cheeses to customize your omelet to your preferences.

A long time ago, people made strong, thick strings called ropes in a place called Bold St. These ropes were very important because they helped in tying and lifting heavy things, like in big boats and buildings. So, Bold St was a very busy place where people made and sold ropes to others who needed them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? Nick thought role playing games were fun but Justin preferred shooter games. Choose from: [A]. Nick bought a Final Fantasy game.; [B]. Justin bought a Final Fantasy game.;","completion":"Although both options mention the purchase of a Final Fantasy game, which is a role-playing game, each option involves a different character making the purchase. To provide context and make a well-informed decision about how this sentence should end, let's analyze both Nick and Justin's preferences. Nick enjoys role-playing games, which means he appreciates the story-driven nature and immersive world of these games. He probably values character development and strategic gameplay mechanics that often come with role-playing games. Final Fantasy is a popular role-playing video game series, so it makes sense that Nick might have an interest in purchasing a game from this franchise. On the other hand, Justin prefers shooter games. These games typically focus on reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and fast-paced action. They generally prioritize combat and gunplay over deep narrative experiences. While it's possible that Justin may want to try a role-playing game like Final Fantasy, it's not consistent with his stated preference for shooter games. Based on this analysis, the most fitting conclusion to the sentence would be: Nick thought role playing games were fun, but Justin preferred shooter games. [A]. Nick bought a Final Fantasy game. This choice is consistent with the preferences and interests of each character. While it is not impossible for someone to enjoy multiple genres, the information provided in the sentence points towards Nick being the one more likely to purchase a role-playing game like Final Fantasy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: If you have experienced hair loss, it’s important to see your doctor to find a cause. You may have an underlying disease that’s causing your hair loss, and this may require treatment for you to regrow your hair. Your doctor may order blood tests to assess hormone levels that can cause hair loss. Minoxidil is an over the counter liquid or foam that you massage into your scalp twice daily. This medication may help promote hair growth or decrease hair loss, or even both. Men and women can use minoxidil and you don’t need a prescription. Regrowth peaks at about 16 weeks. You need to continuously reapply minoxidil to maintain the benefits. You may experience some side effects such as scalp irritation, rapid heart rate, and may even have some hair growth on the face and hands. You can purchase minoxidil at most pharmacies and some grocery stores. If medications and home treatments don’t help hair regrowth, have hair transplant or restoration surgery. This can immediately help fill out thinning hair and can stimulate hair regrowth. Hair transplants or restoration are procedures in which you doctor takes small plugs of hair from different parts of your scalp and implants them into thinner or bald sections. You may need to take hair loss medication before surgery. Hair transplants can be very painful and cause infection and scarring. Be aware that hair transplants and restoration are expensive and insurance may not cover either procedure. Some studies have shown that lower-level laser device treatment can help decrease hair loss and improve thickness. Although more research is necessary, laser treatment may be a good option for you if medications don’t work and you don’t want to undergo a painful hair transplant. There are no known side effects of laser therapy for hair loss.","completion":"If you are losing hair, you should visit a doctor to find the reason. Sometimes, it's because of a sickness and you need to get better to grow your hair back. There is a special lotion called minoxidil that you can rub on your head to help your hair grow or stop falling out. Both boys and girls can use it without asking the doctor, but it may cause some problems like an itchy head or faster heartbeat. If that doesn't work, there are special surgeries, like hair transplant, where a doctor moves hair from one part of your head to another. But this can hurt a lot and costs a lot of money. Another option is using a gentle laser light that might help your hair grow thicker but needs more research to be sure. The good thing is, laser treatment doesn't have bad side effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Carrie gets her first period, and after becoming distressed, cries out for help. Instead of helping, the other girls ridicule and harass her, throwing out tampons, sanitary towels and toilet paper to her. Teacher Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) rushes in to stop the commotion. White, who appears to be bottling extreme rage, snaps a light bulb. After questioning Carrie, Miss Collins realizes that Carrie is unaware of the concept of menstruation. Because of this, Miss Collins asks the school principal to excuse Carrie from gym class for a week because of the trauma. Upon her way home, Carrie uses her recently discovered telekinesis to stop a boy from teasing her. While at home, Carrie is tormented by her delusional mother (Piper Laurie), who locks Carrie in a closet and forces her to pray--she believes that Carrie received her period due to sinning.Miss Collins, still livid about the incident, berates the other girls and forces them through a detention, deliberately physically exhausting them.

Let's analyze these issues before generating a correct version of the sentence. 1. Syntactic Issues: The sentence seems to be a blend of two distinct clauses, which should be separated for better clarity. Additionally, there is a comma between \\"be\\" and \\"better\\" that breaks the flow of the sentence and doesn't serve a clear function. 2. Semantic Issues: The concepts behind the sentence may be understood, but the sentence lacks clarity in its current form. This becomes problematic as the reader has to deduce the intended meaning through context and inference. Considering these issues, we can propose a revised version of the sentence that is both syntactically and semantically acceptable: \\"The more we pretended to be content and well-fed, the angrier we grew at the doctors.\\" In this revised sentence, the structure has been separated into two distinct clauses, where each clause has a clear meaning.

The main similarity between the two sentences is that they both focus on a skier and a specific activity being performed. However, the actual activities being described are rather different in their content and context, which distinguishes the meaning between the two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"A skier wearing blue snow pants is flying through the air near a jump,\\" the primary focus is on the skier's actions of being in motion and flying through the air. This scene can be perceived as an action-packed moment in skiing, likely in the context of a ski event or an adventurous skiing activity. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"A skier stands on his hands in the snow in front of a movie camera,\\" describes a different type of activity. Here, the skier is performing a handstand on the snow, possibly for a movie or a film shoot. This context might suggest that the skier is involved in a more controlled environment, as opposed to actively skiing on the slopes. The presence of the movie camera also provides an additional element that is completely unrelated to the first sentence.

I now have no sound. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"No, the answer to these two questions is not the same, as they are dealing with two distinct issues. Let me address each question individually. Question 1: To properly install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for C language programming and ensure accurate output results, follow these steps: 1. Download and Install Visual Studio Code: Download the latest version of VS Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it following the standard installation procedures for your operating system. 2. Download and Install a C/C++ Compiler: As you are learning C language, you'll need a C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your machine. For Windows, you can use the MinGW distribution (https://mingw-w64.org/) of GCC. For macOS, you can obtain the compiler from Xcode Command Line Tools. For Linux distributions, GCC should already be preinstalled, or you can install it using your package manager. 3. Install the C/C++ extension: Inside VS Code, click on the Extensions tab (or use the shortcut 'Ctrl+Shift+X'). Search for 'C/C++' by Microsoft and install the first one that appears. This extension allows proper syntax highlighting, debugging, and support for C programming language in VS Code. 4. Set up tasks.json: In your project folder, create a file named \\"tasks.json\\" in the \\".vscode\\" folder. This file tells VS Code how to compile and build your C programs. Add the following configuration to compile a single C file (replace \\"gcc\\" by the path of your installed GCC compiler if necessary): \`\`\`json { \\"version\\": \\"2.0.0\\", \\"tasks\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"shell\\", \\"label\\": \\"gcc build active file\\", \\"command\\": \\"gcc\\", \\"args\\": [ \\"-g\\", \\"{file}\\", \\"-o\\", \\"{fileDirname}/{fileBasenameNoExtension}\\" ], \\"options\\": { \\"cwd\\": \\"{workspaceFolder}\\" }, \\"problemMatcher\\": { \\"owner\\": \\"cpp\\", \\"fileLocation\\": [ \\"relative\\", \\"{workspaceFolder}\\" ], \\"pattern\\": { \\"regexp\\": \\"^(.*):(d+):(d+):s+(warning|error):s+(.*)\\", \\"file\\": 1, \\"line\\": 2, \\"column\\": 3, \\"severity\\": 4, \\"message\\": 5 } }, \\"group\\": { \\"kind\\": \\"build\\", \\"isDefault\\": true } } ] } \`\`\` 5. Set up launch.json: In the same \\".vscode\\" folder, create a file named \\"launch.json\\". This file helps VS Code to debug your C programs. Add the following configuration for GDB Debugger (included in GCC): \`\`\`json { \\"version\\": \\"0.2.0\\", \\"configurations\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"gcc build and debug active file\\", \\"type\\": \\"cppdbg\\", \\"request\\": \\"launch\\", \\"program\\": \\"{fileDirname}/{fileBasenameNoExtension}\\", \\"args\\": [], \\"stopAtEntry\\": false, \\"cwd\\": \\"{workspaceFolder}\\", \\"environment\\": [], \\"externalConsole\\": true, \\"MIMode\\": \\"gdb\\", \\"setupCommands\\": [ { \\"description\\": \\"Enable pretty-printing for gdb\\", \\"text\\": \\"-enable-pretty-printing\\", \\"ignoreFailures\\": true } ], \\"preLaunchTask\\": \\"gcc build active file\\", \\"miDebuggerPath\\": \\"/path/to/your/gdb\\" // Replace this with the correct path to your GDB debugger } ] } \`\`\` Remember to replace \\"/path/to/your/gdb\\" in the \\"miDebuggerPath\\" setting with the actual path of your installed GDB debugger. Now, you should be able to compile, run, and debug C programs in VS Code without errors and see their proper output results. If you still encounter issues, double-check your compiler installation and configuration files. Question 2: The 'no audio output device is installed' error message on your Samsung NP 35 notebook running Windows 7 can be resolved by following these steps: 1. Run Windows Troubleshooter: Go to the Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Sound > Troubleshoot audio playback. Follow the prompts to diagnose and potentially fix the audio issue. 2. Update sound drivers: Go to Device Manager (Right-click 'Computer' > Manage > Device Manager) and expand the 'Sound, video, and game controllers' section. Right-click on the audio device and click 'Update Driver Software' to check if there are any updates available. 3. Uninstall sound drivers: In the Device Manager, right-click on the audio device and select 'Uninstall'. Restart your computer after the uninstallation. Windows will detect the missing driver and reinstall it automatically. 4.

Ask a question about Insect.","completion":"Sure, here is an in-depth question on the topic of insects: What are the distinguishing characteristics of Insecta, their roles in the ecosystem, the diverse types of insects present worldwide, their unique reproductive and metamorphosis processes, their adaptations to survive in various environments, and the impacts, both positive and negative, on human life and the overall biodiversity? This question invites a discussion on several different facets of insects. Here's a brief overview: 1. **Distinguishing Characteristics of Insecta**: This could cover the physical and functional properties that differentiate insects from other species in the animal kingdom. For instance, insects generally have three pairs of legs, a body segmented into three parts (head, thorax, abdomen), compound eyes, antennae, and often one or two pairs of wings. 2. **Roles in the Ecosystem**: This could delve into how insects contribute to various ecological systems. For instance, insects are beneficial as pollinators in the reproduction of many plants, serve as a food source for other animals, and play significant roles in soil aeration and nutrient cycling. 3. **Diverse Types of Insects**: This could cover the classification of different types of insects like beetles, butterflies, bees, ants, flies, etc., and their notable species worldwide, along with their specific attributes. 4. **Reproductive and Metamorphosis Processes**: This part could discuss the various reproductive methods adopted by insects, from egg-laying to live births in some species. The unique transformation process insects like butterflies or beetles go through, from eggs to larvae/caterpillars to adulthood, commonly known as metamorphosis, could also be discussed. 5. **Survival Adaptations of Insects**: This could discuss various adaptations insects manifest to survive and thrive in their respective environments. For example, certain insects may develop camouflage abilities to blend in, some could evolve mechanisms to tolerate extreme temperatures, and others might develop sophisticated social structures like in the case of ants, bees, and termites. 6. **Impacts on Human Life and Biodiversity**: This would include discussing how insects could be both harmful and beneficial to humans. On the one hand, some insects spread diseases, cause crop loss, or become residential pests, while on the other hand, they are important in pollination, keeping pest populations in check, producing honey, silk, etc. Overall, this question should lead to a comprehensive exploration of Insecta, providing a holistic understanding of these fascinating creatures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Isaac Kolstad, a former linebacker at Minnesota State University, Mankato, finally got a chance to return home after suffering a skull fracture and traumatic brain injury in a bar fight that happened last May near his school. His wife, Molly, shared the happy news on Kolstad's CaringBridge page. Scroll down for video. Back and doing better: Isaac Kolstad m(above in yellow at a September football game), a former linebacker at Minnesota State University, Mankato, emerged from rehab five months after he was attacked in a bar fight and suffered a traumatic brain injury. Baby girl: While he was in rehab his wife gave birth to a daughter, Malia (above with her father) Sportsman: Kolstad (pictured playing in a 2012 game) had to relearn how to walk. 'It is with a full heart that I update you all that today Isaac was discharged from inpatient care!' she wrote. 'After 5 months of being confined to a facility, of sleeping in a twin sized hospital bed, of reporting daily to nurses, doctors, therapists, and aides, Isaac is finally released and free to go home. He and his entire family are incredibly excited to take this huge step in Isaac’s recovery and start the process of transitioning back to family life.' Just this past September, Kolstad, 24, who graduated in 2013, made an emotional return to the playing field with some of his former teammates, walking out before kickoff during the opening game of ther season. He also became a father for the second time when his baby daughter Malia was born in June, less than a month after he was injured. Kolstand and his wife have another daughter, Haidyn. Rutgers University quarterback Philip Robert Nelson, who once played at the University of Minnesota, has been charged with one count of first-degree assault and one count of third-degree assault for the incident. Trevor Shelley, 21, who authorities believe punched Kolstad, was arrested just days after the attack and charged with felony assault counts. Kolstad, described by a friend as 'a quiet, young man' who was not a big drinker, was with a group of football players in the South Street Saloon just before closing time on the night of the fight. According to a criminal complaint, 20-year-old Nelson was angry that night because a bouncer at the bar had hit on his girlfriend.

Nelson and Kolstad got into a verbal dispute before Kolstad threw a punch that hit Nelson in the back, causing him to fall to the ground, according to a police officer, the complaint says. Graduate student Steph Stassen, 25, told the Star Tribune that the attacker came 'out of nowhere'. 'He [Kolstad] was knocked out on his feet,' she told the paper. 'He fell straight back and smoked his head on the pavement.' He was found at an intersection around 2am by police and taken to hospital in an ambulance. Kolstad suffered bleeding of the brain, skull fracture, brain swelling, brain shifting, and deterioration of lungs from lack of oxygen, according to the criminal complaint. He is now being treated at an inpatient rehabilitation program in the Twin Cities. There, he has bonded well with his new daughter, his wife Molly wrote.

Green was forced to issue an international charter to the auto workers in August 1935, although he assumed control of the union through appointing its president, Francis Dillon, a henchman. Say this using Spanish","completion":"En agosto de 1935, Green se vio obligado a emitir una carta internacional a los trabajadores del automóvil, aunque asumió el control del sindicato al nombrar a su presidente, Francis Dillon, un hombre de confianza. A continuación, se presentará una explicación detallada de este evento histórico en español. La Industria del automóvil experimentó un crecimiento acelerado en la década de 1930, atrayendo a un número creciente de trabajadores y generando una mayor demanda de representación laboral. En ese contexto, William Green, líder de la American Federation of Labor (AFL), se encontró bajo la presión de integrar a estos trabajadores en la federación y defender sus derechos e intereses. A lo largo del período previo a agosto de 1935, la industria automotriz fue testigo de un creciente descontento entre los trabajadores, quienes abogaban por mejoras en sus condiciones laborales, salarios y el reconocimiento de sus derechos. Esta situación llevó a la creación del United Automobile Workers (UAW), un sindicato especialmente diseñado para representar a los trabajadores en este sector en particular y abogar por sus intereses colectivos. La AFL, que representaba a múltiples sindicatos en diferentes sectores, tenía un enfoque más conservador en cuanto a la representación laboral y no estaba dispuesta a otorgar el tipo de autonomía que los trabajadores del automóvil buscaban en su sindicato. En este contexto, en agosto de 1935, Green se enfrentó a una situación en la que se vio obligado a emitir una carta internacional para el UAW y, al mismo tiempo, mantener su autoridad y control sobre la organización. Para lograr esto, Green decidió nombrar al presidente del UAW, seleccionando a Francis Dillon, quien era conocido por ser uno de sus hombres de confianza, leales a sus ideales y estrategias. Con Dillon en el cargo de liderazgo del sindicato, Green garantizó que el UAW se mantuviera bajo el control de la AFL y seguiría sus directrices, limitando su capacidad de lucha y negociación. De este modo, aunque Green accedió a otorgar la carta internacional, impuso restricciones al movimiento obrero automotriz y su autonomía. Este control ayudaría a mantener el predominio de la AFL en la representación laboral en los Estados Unidos durante algún tiempo. Este hecho, sin embargo, contribuyó a la creciente insatisfacción entre los trabajadores y, en última instancia, sentaría las bases para un impulso renovado a la independencia y la búsqueda de una mejor representación, lo cual culminaría en el desarrollo del Congreso de Organizaciones Industriales (CIO) en 1938, que se convertiría en otra entidad influyente en la defensa de los derechos de los trabajadores."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, Jedediah, Octavius, Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. A new wax Neanderthal resembling Larry named Laaa is introduced, identifying Larry as his father. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet is corroding, which later causes the exhibits to act erratically, causing mayhem at the planetarium's reopening. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick, who plans on taking a gap year to sort out his life, throwing a house party. Larry reunites with Cecil, now in retirement, who realizes the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, convinced that McPhee knows its secrets. Larry and Nick travel to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly.

Texas A&M began claiming the 1919 national championship in 2012. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Texas A&M began claiming the 1919 national championship after 2010\\"?","completion":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, we can indeed conclude that Texas A&M began claiming the 1919 national championship after 2010. Specifically, the paragraph states that Texas A&M started boasting about their supposed national championship achievement in 2012 – that's two years after 2010, thus supporting the statement. To explain further, a declaration of claiming the 1919 national championship, particularly in 2012, essentially denotes that Texas A&M's standpoint regarding their status in that championship season only officially came to light 93 years after the season had taken place. This decision on their part naturally implies that for a long period, Texas A&M did not assert themselves as the champions of that particular season. However, it's critical to remember that in the case of the 1919 NCAA football season, there was no clear-cut national champion. The NCAA's official record book recognizes multiple teams - Centre, Harvard, Illinois, Notre Dame, and Texas A&M - as potential champions according to different major selectors. Of this group, only Harvard, Illinois, and Texas A&M have claimed national championships for the 1919 season. This demonstrates that claims regarding championships in historical seasons can be subject to revision or newly brought to light years, even decades, after the games were played. This long-delayed claim to the national championship by Texas A&M could be due to a variety of reasons, notably including reassessment of the season's play, re-evaluation of records, or even changes in the school's policy or ambition in asserting its historical performance in athletics. It must be remembered, however, that such claims, especially made long after the events, may sometimes be contentious and not universally accepted.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Paragraph: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which new planet has a cooler atmosphere? The answer is:","completion":"Bothar.

The Tragedy of Lucretia is a tempera and oil painting on a wood \\"cassone\\" or \\"spalliera\\" panel by whch Italian Renaissance master, it is housed in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts, having been owned by Isabella Stewart Gardner in her lifetime? The answer is:","completion":"The Tragedy of Lucretia is a tempera and oil painting on a wood \\"cassone\\" or \\"spalliera\\" panel by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli. Born as Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi in Florence, Italy, Botticelli was a prominent artist during the Italian Renaissance, and he is particularly known for his mythological and religious paintings. The Tragedy of Lucretia, completed around 1499-1500, depicts the story of Lucretia, a noblewoman from ancient Rome, whose rape by the son of the Etruscan king, Sextus Tarquinius, led to the uprising that overthrew the monarchy and established the Roman Republic. The painting captures the moment of Lucretia's suicide, showing her stabbing herself in the chest with a dagger while surrounded by various members of her family, who appear in a state of shock and despair. The artwork is housed in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts. Isabella Stewart Gardner was an American philanthropist and art collector who purchased the painting during her lifetime. She was known for her extensive travels in Europe and assembling an impressive collection of Old Master paintings, which included works by Titian, Raphael, and Rembrandt. In 1903, she founded the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum as a way to share her extensive art collection with the public. The museum is designed in the style of a Venetian palace and reflects Gardner's passion for Italian art and architecture. The Tragedy of Lucretia is displayed in a way that allows visitors to appreciate the intricate details and rich colors used by Botticelli. The painting is an important example of Botticelli's late style, which is characterized by a greater emphasis on line and more abstract, elongated forms. Its presence in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum contributes to the significance of the collection and helps to showcase the extraordinary talent of Sandro Botticelli during the Italian Renaissance period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Bernard Kramer, from Florida, hid 1.1m from the IRS for around 25 years. He squirreled the money away in secret Swiss and Israeli accounts. He has been ordered to pay a 588,042 penalty and could face years in jail. Article:","completion":"Title: Florida Man Hides Over 1 Million from IRS for 25 Years Subtitle: Bernard Kramer faces jail time and heavy penalties for tax evasion by utilizing secret accounts Introduction: For many, tax evasion seems like a far-fetched crime reserved for the ultra-wealthy or those involved in organized crime. However, Bernard Kramer's case shows that it can happen closer to home. Step 1: Introduce Bernard Kramer and tax evasion charges Bernard Kramer, a resident of Florida, managed to keep 1.1 million hidden from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for approximately 25 years. His elaborate plan to avoid paying taxes involved maintaining secret Swiss and Israeli bank accounts, where the money was safely concealed from the prying eyes of authorities. Step 2: Mention the consequences Bernard Kramer faces However, all good things must come to an end. Now that the truth has been unveiled, Kramer has been ordered by the court to pay a penalty of 588,042. In addition to the hefty financial hit, Kramer could face years in jail for his actions to evade taxes for such an extended period. Step 3: Explain the broader implications of tax evasion This case highlights the pressing issue of tax evasion in the United States and serves as a sharp reminder of the consequences that await those who intentionally mislead the IRS. Law enforcement agencies and federal authorities have frequently been involved in efforts to combat and prosecute tax evasion in recent years. Step 4: Discuss the impact on the general public Apart from the financial and legal repercussions, such cases also serve as a deterrent to others who may be considering similar tax evasion tactics. By taking appropriate legal action against tax evaders, the IRS sends a strong message to the public about the obligations and responsibilities of every citizen to pay their taxes in full and on time. Conclusion: Bernard Kramer's tax evasion case shines a light on the various tactics people employ in an attempt to evade taxes. It also serves as a sobering reminder of the severe consequences that come with such actions. The penalties and potential jail time send a clear message to anyone considering engaging in tax evasion that the risk is not worth the possible rewards. The story of Kramer's hidden millions is a cautionary tale for all, emphasizing the importance of diligently paying taxes and being transparent with authorities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: For example, avoid forwarding an email containing a secret, especially if the person you're e-mailing doesn't want you to. Doing so can possibly cause the recipient to lose trust in you, and you could possibly have your relationship messed up. You certainly do not want that to happen. If you feel tempted to do so, put yourself in the other person's shoes, and think about how you would feel if that person spread rumors about you. For example, if your friend has a reputation for being mean and bossy, think about how you would feel if your friend told your other friends about one of your quirks. You wouldn't be very happy, right? For example, avoid letting your friend know that her friend broke up with an ex-boyfriend. Email isn't completely private, so it's possible that the person whose business you're discussing could see the emails and become mad at you and/or embarrassed, and this could mess up your relationship with the person. Flames are basically insults sent online to offend you, so it's important not to send flames to other people or start flame wars. This could make the other person mad, and you could also have your account suspended for this. This can be anything, from a person's age to the name of the school that he or she goes to. Put yourself in the other person's shoes -- how would you feel if someone gave your friend the address of your house? You would not be very happy, so be sure to obtain permission before sharing someone's personal information with others over email, or don't do so at all. It will show you are angry and you can upset the person. For example, if you're angry at someone at work, and you email that person a large rant in all caps, this could cause the person that you emailed to become irritated. This is the same thing with replying to emails; if you're angry at someone for sending you a particular message, hold off replying until you have calmed down. Summary:","completion":"Avoid forwarding sensitive information in emails, as this can damage trust and relationships. Consider how you would feel if someone spread rumors about you. Remember that email is not completely private. Don't engage in insulting behavior or share personal information without permission. If you're angry, wait until you're calm before responding to emails to prevent escalation and negative consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Einstein's connection with the politics of the nuclear bomb is well known: He signed the letter to President Franklin Roosevelt that persuaded the United States to take the idea seriously, and he engaged in postwar efforts to prevent nuclear war. But these were not just the isolated actions of a scientist dragged into the world of politics. Einstein's life was, in fact, \\"divided between politics and equations .\\" Sickened by what he saw as the waste of human lives during the First World War, he became involved in antiwar demonstrations. His support of civil disobedience did little to endear him to his colleagues. Then, following the war, he directed his efforts toward reconciliation and improving international relations. And soon his politics were making it difficult for him to visit the United States, even to give lectures. Einstein's second great cause was Zionism . Although he was Jewish, Einstein rejected the idea of God. However, a growing awareness of anti-Semitism , both before and during the War, led him gradually to identify with the Jewish community, and later to become an outspoken supporter of Zionism. His theories came under attack. One man was accused of motivating others to murder Einstein and fined a mere six dollars. When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, \\"If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!\\" When Hitler came to power, Einstein then in America declared he would not return to Germany. While Nazi attacked his house and confiscated his bank account, a Berlin newspaper displayed the headline \\"Good News from Einstein--He's Not Coming Back.\\" Fearing that German scientists would build a nuclear bomb, Einstein proposed that the United States should develop its own. But he was publicly warning of the dangers of nuclear war and proposing international control of nuclear weaponry. Throughout his life, Einstein's efforts toward peace probably achieved little and won him few friends. His support of the Zionist cause, however, was recognized in 1952,...

The zinnia is a member of which flower family","completion":"The zinnia is a member of the Asteraceae family, also commonly referred to as the Compositae family. This family of flowering plants is one of the largest in the plant kingdom, consisting of over 23,000 species, with more than 1,620 genera and 13 subfamilies. The Asteraceae family is distributed across the globe, with species native to many regions including America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. The most distinguishing characteristic of the Asteraceae family is the composite nature of its flowers. They are composed of numerous small individual flowers, or \\"florets,\\" that form a larger, single flower head called a capitulum. The capitulum is typically surrounded by a whorl of leaves, known as an involucre, which gives the appearance of petals. However, the true flowers are the florets themselves. There are generally two types of florets within a capitulum: the disk florets, which are in the center and usually tubular in shape, and the ray florets, which tend to be either petal-like or flattened around the edges of the cluster. This unique composition of the Asteraceae family allows for a great diversity of flower shapes, sizes, and colors, which is why it encompasses such a large array of genera and species. Some popular members of this family, besides the zinnia, include daisies, sunflowers, chrysanthemums, asters, and marigolds. Zinnias, belonging to the genus Zinnia, are native to Mexico and the American Southwest; however, they have been cultivated across the world due to their vibrant colors and dazzling displays. There are nearly 20 species of zinnia, and they come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, ranging from small, single-flower plants to large, bush-like varieties with a height of 40 inches or more. These annual plants have a relatively short growing season and prefer hot, dry conditions, making them a popular choice for gardens in many regions. Zinnias are also valued for their ability to attract pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. They are incredibly popular among gardeners because they are easy to grow and maintain, provided they receive plenty of sunlight and are kept in well-drained soil. In summary, the zinnia is a member of the Asteraceae or Compositae family, which is characterized by its unique flower structure, featuring numerous small florets forming a composite flower head. Known for their diversity in size, shape, and color, zinnias are a popular choice among gardeners worldwide, appreciated for their vibrant beauty and ease of maintenance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, \\"Space Oddity\\", and later in the song \\"Heroes\\", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that \\"in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness.\\"Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as \\"particularly deliberate and distinctive\\".

The Ottoman Empire suffered defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and was forced to withdraw rapidly from Central Europe. The defeat and the chaotic situation within the Ottoman Empire created widespread social disruption in the Central Balkans, particularly in the regions of Skopje and Niš, where Karposh's rebellion originated. On 25 October 1689, the Austrian branch of the Holy League, led by General Piccolomini, reached the Plain of Skopje and were met with rejoicing by the inhabitants of the villages there. The same day, Piccolomini began a withdrawal of his forces, and on October 26, set fire to the city. Skopje burned for two whole days, through the 26th and 27 October. Most of the city of Skopje was destroyed in the fire. Some accounts of these events state that Piccolomini razed Skopje due to an inability of his forces to occupy and govern a city so far from his headquarters, while other accounts state that it was perpetrated to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Answer this question: What happened first, Piccolomini withdrew his forces or set fire to the city?","completion":"According to the information provided, on October 25, 1689, General Piccolomini and the Austrian branch of the Holy League reached the Plain of Skopje and were met with rejoicing by the inhabitants.

This week has gone by so fast , I can not believe it is already Friday . On Tuesday I ended up sleeping for about 13 hours ... it was insane . By the time I woke up , ate breakfast / lunch , showered , and got ready it was 2 pm . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why does the narrator feel so rested ?","completion":"The narrator feels so rested likely because they slept for an unusually long duration of 13 hours on Tuesday. Typically, adults need around 7-9 hours of sleep per night to function optimally. In this case, the narrator significantly exceeded the average sleep duration, allowing their body and mind to recover and rejuvenate more extensively. There could be various reasons for this extended sleep, such as accumulated fatigue, the body's need for extra rest to recover from illness, or simply the individual's unique sleep pattern. The passage also implies that the narrator was surprised by the length of their sleep, indicating it was not a routine occurrence. This sudden increase in rest may allow the narrator to feel more refreshed and rejuvenated than they would if they had only slept the typical 7-9 hour duration. Moreover, the passage describes the events that transpired after waking up, such as having breakfast/lunch, showering, and getting ready. Such routines can also contribute to the narrator feeling rested, as engaging in these activities helps to signal the start of a new day, allowing the narrator to feel more prepared and energized. In summary, the narrator feels so rested because they had an unusually long and extended sleep, which allowed their body and mind to recover more than they would have during an average night's rest. Additionally, their morning routine and activities may have further contributed to this feeling of rejuvenation and preparedness for the day ahead."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kyle was wearing a sweatshirt while Aaron was in a tank top because","completion":"it was a sunny day with a little bit of wind. You see, Kyle gets cold easily, so he likes to wear something called a sweatshirt. It's a warm and cozy piece of clothing that covers his arms and body, kinda like a big, soft hug. On the other hand, Aaron doesn't feel the cold as much as Kyle does. So, he chose to wear something called a tank top. A tank top is a shirt that doesn't have any sleeves, which means his arms are not covered. This allows Aaron to keep cooler in the sun. As the two friends walked down the street, they spotted an ice cream truck. This is a big, colorful vehicle that plays happy music and sells sweet, cold treats called ice cream. When you eat ice cream, it helps you cool down when it's hot outside - and it's tasty, too! Kyle and Aaron couldn't resist the yummy ice cream, so they lined up to buy some. Kyle chose a chocolate ice cream cone with lots of sprinkles on top. Chocolate is a rich, sweet flavor that many kids like. Sprinkles are tiny, colorful candies that make the ice cream look even more fun! Aaron picked a fruity popsicle, which is another type of frozen treat. It's made of fruit juice that's turned into a solid, cold bar on a stick. Aaron loves the sweet and tangy taste of the fruit-flavored popsicle. With their frozen treats in hand, Kyle and Aaron sat down on a bench under a big tree. The tree had wide, green leaves that made a cool shade for them to enjoy their ice cream and popsicle. They happily ate their treats, feeling the cool sensation in their mouths, and talked about their plans for the rest of the sunny day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The imminent risk of conflict breaking out and disturbing the peace in the continent had become a deep-seated concern for many, especially for the leaders of Germany. As the crisis between Ukraine and Russia moved from a proxy war to an all-out conflict, Europe's stability was put into limbo. Countries watched, waiting for signs that would determine the fate of the continent. Germany, notably, was not just a passive observer. With Angela Merkel at the helm, it took the initiative to mediate the situation, and with good reason. Germany's economy is one of the largest in Europe and a war in the continent would bring tension and insecurity that could disrupt many of its engagements. Moreover, Germany's post-war identity is deeply tied to its commitment to peace in Europe. Any threat to this peace puts at risk more than just economic interests but the very values that modern Germany stands for. Many important decisions had to be made. Political, economic, and military strategies had to be laid out meticulously. In turn, as the country in the middle, Germany did not only mediate but also had the responsibility to mitigate any potential spillover effects of the escalating conflict. Talks in Berlin and Brussels took over the scenography. The centrality of Germany in these negotiations was key. Angela Merkel, armed with her patient yet firm negotiating style, became the voice of diplomacy in the crisis. She spoke, not only with world leaders but also with the citizens, reiterating the importance of peace and stability in Europe. However, despite all these, war broke out. The fog of uncertainty had lifted, revealing a tense battlefield. Yet, even in the face of a full-blown conflict, the dedication towards peace negotiations continued. The story culminates in an important meeting - a diplomatic summit arranged by Germany, attended by leaders from Europe as well as representatives from Russia and Ukraine. In this meeting, the grievances of each side were heard, interests were discussed, and solutions were proposed. The tension in the room was palpable, with everyone aware that the decisions made could alter the course of European future. After a grueling negotiation, an agreement was reached. Merkel's voice echoed through the room, sealing the deal that can possibly put an end to a war and setting forth a new framework for peace reinstatement in the region. Yet, even as this compromise marks an important step, everyone in the room knew that this only signals the beginning of a long and difficult journey towards peace. This, quite tentatively, marked the end of the story. No hero's win, no villain's defeat. Simply a commitment to a long path to peace. Yet, this doesn't negate the fact that significant progress has been made. Progress that took the most out of Germany and its allies, out of Merkel and her tenacity. As the room settled, a wave of relief filled the room, bringing a sense of peace after weeks, months, of uncertainty. A peace won not on the battlefield, but in rooms filled with diplomats striving to keep, sustain, and carry forward the peace of Europe - the very thing they had a lot at stake for."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose baby was in fact aborted? The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Key to a Successful Job Interview: Preparation, Presentation, and Follow-up Introduction Job interviews can be stressful and challenging scenarios that have the potential to define your professional future. The difference between having a successful job interview and struggling to make a positive impression often comes down to good preparation, effective presentation, and diligent follow-up. By considering these factors, candidates can substantially improve their chances of success and increase the probability of obtaining their desired position. In this article, we will discuss several vital aspects to keep in mind when preparing for and conducting an interview, as well as the importance of following up afterward. 1. Study the Company Beforehand One of the most effective ways to make a positive impression on your interviewer is to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the company where you are seeking a job. Before the interview takes place, take some time to research the organization's history, mission, and values. Familiarize yourself with the company's products or services, target market, and competitive landscape. Make sure you know who the key players are within the organization, such as its founders, executives, and managers. By studying the company, you will show the interviewer that you have a genuine interest in the position and that you have taken the time to consider the organization's context and environment. 2. Research Commonly Asked Interview Questions While interview questions are often tailored to each specific job, there are a number of commonly asked questions that candidates should be prepared to answer. Some of these questions include: - What can you tell me about yourself? - Why do you want this job? - Where do you see yourself in five years? - Can you explain why you left your last job? In addition to these general questions, be prepared to discuss your strengths, weaknesses, and any job-specific skills or qualifications you may possess. The key to answering interview questions is to be concise, honest, and engaging. Think about how your answers will highlight your suitability for the role and consider examples from your professional or personal life that illustrate your capabilities. 3. Mind the Basics on Interview Day The day of your interview is just as important as the preparation you do ahead of time. First, make sure to dress appropriately for the company culture, whether that means choosing a formal suit or opting for more casual attire. Arrive at least 10-15 minutes early, as punctuality is crucial. Bring multiple copies of your resume, a notepad, and a pen to take notes during the interview. Finally, come prepared with a positive and motivated attitude to make the best impression possible. 4. Pay Attention to Body Language During the interview, it is essential to be conscious of your body language. Maintaining eye contact, avoiding slouching, and using confident body postures can make a significant difference in the way you are perceived by the interviewer. These gestures show that you are attentive, confident, and engaged in the conversation. Also, keep in mind the importance of active listening – give the interviewer the full attention that they deserve. 5. Follow the Tone of the Interviewer Each interview and interviewer will be unique and adopt a different tone. It is crucial to be adaptable in response to the interviewer's style, whether it is formal, casual, or somewhere in between. Be aware of the interviewer’s cues and adjust your responses accordingly. This will help create rapport and demonstrate your ability to work within a diverse range of professional settings. 6. Ask Questions to the Interviewer Many interviewers will provide the opportunity for candidates to ask questions at the end of the interview. Utilize this time to demonstrate your interest in the company and position by asking thoughtful and relevant questions. Examples of appropriate questions include: - What is the company culture like? - What kind of growth opportunities are available within the company? - Can you tell me more about the team I would be working with? 7. Follow Up After the Interview Finally, the interview process does not end when you leave the room. Within 24-48 hours, send a thank-you email to the interviewer, expressing your gratitude for the opportunity and reiterating your interest in the position. This gesture will leave a lasting positive impression and could make the difference in securing a job offer. Conclusion To sum up, the key components to a successful job interview are thorough preparation, effective presentation, and diligent follow-up. By studying the company, anticipating interview questions, adhering to interview day basics, and establishing rapport with the interviewer, you significantly increase your chances of making a positive impression and securing a job offer. Remember, showing genuine interest and enthusiasm goes a long way, and with the right mindset, you can truly stand out as the perfect candidate for the role."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Well, nobody's asking, but it's too bad our American blues founders didn't get the fame and fortune they deserved, eh? Is this product review negative? OPTIONS: (1). Yes. (2). No. Answer:","completion":"The product review is not negative, but it highlights some interesting points. To give a more detailed answer, we'll first break down the elements of the review and consider the context behind the statements made by the reviewer. The album referred to appears to be Fleetwood Mac's \\"Mac Magic,\\" which features a combination of British rock and American blues music. The reviewer acknowledges the appeal this album had back in the day; the use of the term \\"ear-opener\\" suggests that the reviewer found the music refreshing and novel. This can be considered a positive aspect of the review. However, it is important to notice that the reviewer's tone implies a slight surprise, as they mention that they didn't expect the Brits (British musicians) to know anything about the blues – a musical genre deeply rooted in the African American experience. The mention of the \\"real music invasion\\" implies that the blending of two distinct musical cultures resulted in a significant and noteworthy impact on the U.S. music scene. The latter part of the review expresses a hint of regret or criticism towards the way the original American blues founders did not get the fame and fortune they deserved. This sentiment, while not directed towards the album itself, sheds light on the historical context and the power imbalance in music appropriation. The reviewer doesn't seem to blame Fleetwood Mac for this issue, rather acknowledges the unfortunate circumstances surrounding it. Considering these aspects, the answer to the question would be: (2). No. The review doesn't have a negative stance towards the album itself; it offers praise and puts forward an important discussion about the recognition and appreciation of the original American blues musicians."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this: Measurement of light or photometry is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source, along with the colors that can be rendered by this light. The human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum, therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light. The basic SI unit of measurement is the candela (cd), which describes the luminous intensity, all other photometric units are derived from the candela. Luminance for instance is a measure of the density of luminous intensity in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle. The SI unit for luminance is candela per square metre (cd/m2).

Information: - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - John Michael \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English singer, songwriter, and actor. He rose to prominence in the early 1970s as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath. He was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 and went on to have a successful solo career, releasing 11 studio albums, the first seven of which were all awarded multi-platinum certifications in the US. Osbourne has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions, recording the album \\"13\\" in 2013. His longevity and success have earned him the informal title of \\"Godfather of Heavy Metal\\". - Ö, or ö, is a character that represents either a letter from several extended Latin alphabets, or the letter O modified with an umlaut mark or diaeresis. In many languages, the letter ö, or the O modified with what is known as an \\"umlaut mark\\", is used to denote the non-close front rounded vowels or . In languages without such vowels, the character is known as an \\"O with diaeresis\\" and denotes a syllable break, wherein its pronunciation remains an unmodified . - Ian Fraser Kilmister (24 December 1945 28 December 2015), better known as Lemmy, was an English musician, singer, and songwriter who founded and fronted the rock band Motörhead. His music was one of the foundations of the heavy metal genre. He was known for his appearance (including his friendly mutton chops), his distinctive gravelly voice and distinctive bass playing style. Alongside his music career, he also had many minor roles in film and television. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - Peter Frederick \\"Pete\\" Way (born 7 August 1951, Enfield, Middlesex) is an English bass player. He is the former, and best-known, bassist of UFO, Waysted and also Fastway and Ozzy Osbourne. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Waysted is a rock band formed by the UFO bass guitarist Pete Way and the Scottish rocker Fin Muir (Ian More) in 1982. Recruiting Frank Noon (formerly with Def Leppard), Ronnie Kayfield and Paul Raymond, Waysted signed to Chrysalis Records and released \\"Vices\\" in 1983. - Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums. - Mechanix is the tenth studio album by the British hard rock band UFO ; it was released in 1982 .

Journalist Geoff Barton coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper \\"Sounds\\" to describe the emergence of new heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music. - A bassist, or bass player, is a musician who plays a bass instrument such as a double bass, bass guitar, keyboard bass or a low brass instrument such as a tuba or sousaphone. Different musical genres tend to be associated with one or more of these instruments. Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for funk, R&B, soul music, rock and roll, reggae, jazz fusion, heavy metal, country and pop music. The double bass is the standard bass instrument for classical music, bluegrass, rockabilly, and most genres of jazz. Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in Dixieland and New Orleans-style jazz bands.

Question: How did Lady Beldon disregard the judges' decision that her rose was the winner? Movie title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house.

Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police.

Choices: - emergence - intelligent design - generation - evolution A: A:","completion":"Fossils provide a window into the past, hinting at the existence and diversity of life on Earth over millions of years. They serve as evidence for evolution. Evolution refers to the process by which species change and adapt over time through genetic variation, natural selection, and adaptation to their environment. This process helps explain the vast array of complex and diverse species that have lived or are living on our planet. Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of plants, animals, and other organisms from long-ago geological eras. They can be found in sedimentary rocks, ice, amber, or other natural materials where preservation has occurred. These preserved pieces of history come in various forms, such as bones, teeth, shells, imprints, or even entire organisms trapped in amber or tar. By analyzing these fossils, scientists can piece together a timeline of evolutionary history, tracing the development and diversification of life on Earth. There are multiple ways fossils serve as evidence for evolution, some of which include: 1. Morphological change: Studying the similarities and differences among the physical, anatomical, and morphological features of fossil specimens can show how species have evolved over time. For example, the fossils of early horses reveal a gradual development from small, dog-sized creatures with multiple toes to larger, single-toed modern horses. This morphological change helps to demonstrate the evolutionary process. 2. Transitional fossils: These fossils show intermediary stages in the evolution of one species to another. They provide insight into how different organisms are related and how they evolved from common ancestors. For example, fossils of Tiktaalik, a fish-like creature with limb-like appendages, provide evidence of a link between fish and early tetrapods (four-legged vertebrates). 3. Ancestral and descendant relationships: By analyzing fossils and their geological context, scientists can determine the relative age of species and trace the ancestral and descendant relationships among them. This helps to build a \\"family tree\\" of life on Earth, showing how species evolved from common ancestors and diversified over time. 4. Biogeographical distribution: The geographical distribution of fossils can provide information about the movement of continents and how species migrated and evolved in response to changing environments. This distribution often aligns with the predictions of evolution, as closely related species are typically found in close geographical proximity to each other. 5. Comparisons with living organisms: Fossil evidence can be compared to living organisms to help determine how groups of species are related and how they evolved over time. For example, by comparing the structure of the limbs of whales, bats, and humans, we can see evidence of a common ancestor with a similar limb structure, supporting the idea of divergence through evolution. In conclusion, fossils are valuable evidence for evolution, as they offer snapshots into Earth's biological history and allow scientists to trace the development, adaptation, and diversification of species over time. By studying fossils, researchers can learn more about how life on Earth has changed and evolved, further strengthening the foundations of evolutionary theory."},{"prompt":"Question: what are some animals in a tigers environment?

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose mother died in 1818? is inside the article: Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti).

Identify the common elements: - A person wearing a hat (large-brimmed hat vs. hat pulled down over eyes) - A motor vehicle (green moped vs. motorbike) 2. Determine whether the common elements are consistent. - The hat can be considered consistent since a large-brimmed hat can be pulled down over the eyes - The motor vehicle is not consistent since a moped and motorbike are different types of vehicles 3. Assess whether the additional elements in the first statement can be inferred from the second statement. - \\"Standing by a green moped\\": There is no information that the motorbike is green or that the person is standing by it, so this cannot be concluded. - \\"Looking over a body of water\\": There is no mention of a body of water or what the person is looking at, so this cannot be concluded. - \\"With a skyline in the background\\": There is no mention of a skyline in the second statement, so this cannot be concluded. Considering the analysis of the statements above, it is not possible to conclude that \\"A person wearing a large-brimmed hat is standing by a green moped while looking over a body of water with a skyline in the background\\" based on the information given in \\"A man pulls his hat down lower over his eyes as he begins to steal a motorbike.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Children whose minds wander might have sharper brains, a research suggests. A study has found that people who appear to be often distracted have more \\"working memory\\", giving them the ability to hold a lot of information in their heads and control it cleverly. Children at school need this type of memory on a daily basis for a variety of tasks, such as following teachers' instructions or remembering dictated sentences. During the study, volunteers were asked to perform one simple task during which researchers kept asking if their minds were wandering. At the end, volunteers measured their working memory capacity by their ability to remember a series of letters mixed with simple maths questions. Daniel Levinson, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States, said that those with higher working memory capacity reported \\"more mind wandering during these simple tasks\\", but their performance did not _ . The results, published online in the journal Psychological Science, appear to confirm former research that found working memory allows humans to deal with multiple thoughts at the same time. Dr Jonathan Smallwood, of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Science in Leipzig, Germany, said, \\"What this study seems to suggest is that, when surroundings for the task aren't very difficult, people with additional working memory capacity use them effectively to think about other things besides what they're doing.\\" Working memory capacity is also associated with general measures of intelligence, such as reading comprehension and IQ scores. Dr Smallwood added: \\"Our results suggest the sorts of planning that people do quite often in daily life - when they are on the bus, when they are cycling to work, when they are in the shower - are probably supported by working memory.\\" Question: What's the text mainly about?

Please answer the following question: President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

As the Republicans were not able to secure the necessary votes for the replacement bill, they faced opposition and had to delay the vote. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer stated that the reason the bill failed was because millions of Americans were against it.

She was a cousin (and life-long close friend) of Edwina Ashley, who married Lord Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Hypothesis: Marjorie Minna Jenkins Pratt was born into wealth.","completion":"The text doesn't explicitly state the socio-economic status at Marjorie Minna Jenkins Pratt's birth, but we can make reasonable inferences from the given information. Marjorie was a British peeress, a title often associated with upper class and wealth. Her father, Colonel Atherton Edward Jenkins, was a military officer, a profession typically associated with a certain social standing. Additionally, Marjorie's mother, Anna Isabella, was the niece of Sir Ernest Cassel, a significant detail as Sir Ernest Cassel was an influential private banker, financier and a millionaire philanthropist to whom royalty and powerful individuals turned for financial advice and support. Furthermore, Marjorie was a cousin and life-long friend of Edwina Ashley, who married Lord Louis Mountbatten, indicating connection to another wealthy and noble family. Based on the familial and social connections outlined in this paragraph, it is reasonable to infer that Marjorie was likely born into a family of wealth and high social standing. Her close ties to prominent figures in British society help further support this inference. However, it's important to recognize that these connections and titles don't guarantee wealth at the time of Marjorie's birth. Wealth can be lost, or her family might not have shared their affluence directly with Marjorie. It would still be necessary for further historical research or direct evidence about the financial state of Marjorie's immediate family at the time of her birth to confirm the hypothesis beyond doubt. But given the indications in the text, the hypothesis \\"Marjorie Minna Jenkins Pratt was born into wealth\\" is likely to be true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A Special Interest Group (SIG) is a community within a larger organization with a shared interest in advancing a specific area of knowledge, learning or technology where members cooperate to affect or to produce solutions within their particular field, and may communicate, meet, and organize conferences. The term originated on CompuServe, an early online service provider, where SIGs were a section of the service devoted to particular interests. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology. - The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is an international learned society for computing. It was founded in 1947 and is the world's largest scientific and educational computing society. It is a not-for-profit professional membership group. Its membership is more than 100,000 as of 2011. Its headquarters are in New York City. - CompuServe (CompuServe Information Service, also known by its acronym CIS) was the first major commercial online service provider in the United States. It dominated the field during the 1980s and remained a major influence through the mid-1990s. At its peak in the early 1990s, CIS was known for its online chat system, message forums covering a variety of topics, extensive software libraries for most computer platforms, and a series of popular online games, notably MegaWars III and Island of Kesmai. They are also known for their introduction of the GIF format for pictures, and CIS was a very popular GIF exchange mechanism. - ACM SIGACT or SIGACT is the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory , whose purpose is support of research in theoretical computer science . It was founded in 1968 by Patrick C. Fischer . - An online service provider can, for example, be an Internet service provider, an email provider, a news provider (press), an entertainment provider (music, movies), a search engine, an e-commerce site, an online banking site, a health site, an official government site, a wiki, or a Usenet newsgroup. In its original more limited definition, it referred only to a commercial computer communication service in which paid members could dial via a computer modem the service's private computer network and access various services and information resources such a bulletin boards, downloadable files and programs, news articles, chat rooms, and electronic mail services. The term \\"online service\\" was also used in references to these dial-up services. The traditional dial-up online service differed from the modern Internet service provider in that they provided a large degree of content that was only accessible by those who subscribed to the online service, while ISP mostly serves to provide access to the Internet and generally provides little if any exclusive content of its own. In the U.S., the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA) portion of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act has expanded the legal definition of online service in two different ways for different portions of the law. It states in section 512(k)(1): - In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \\"\\"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\\".\\" - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation.

Question: What do parents encourage kids to do when they experience boredom? Options: A. read book B. travel C. sleep D. play chess E. falling down A:","completion":"Parents often encourage their children to engage in activities that can help them cope with boredom while promoting creativity, critical thinking, and personal growth. Among the options provided, A. Read a book is the most in line with common sense. Reading a book allows children to explore new worlds, develop a habit of learning, enhance vocabulary, and improve comprehension abilities. It fosters discipline, concentration, and creative thinking, which contribute to their problem-solving skills and success in life. Books can transport kids into different cultures, perspectives, and scenarios, broadening their minds and nurturing empathy. Aside from reading, option D. Play chess is also a reasonable suggestion. Chess is a strategic game that stimulates brain function, fosters intellectual skills, and develops logical thinking. It can help children to focus better, plan their moves, and strategize. The game allows them to grasp abstract concepts, making them better equipped to face real-life problems. Additionally, the competitive nature of chess keeps it entertaining, and winning games can significantly boost a child's self-confidence. Options B. Travel, and C. Sleep are not as effective in dealing with boredom, especially during the moment of boredom. While traveling offers valuable experiences, it may not be feasible as a day-to-day solution, due to logistical constraints and time limitations. Sleeping is essential for overall well-being, but encouraging children to sleep whenever they are bored isn't an optimal solution, as it does not foster creativity or address the underlying issue. Option E. Falling down is not a suitable suggestion at all. It does not address boredom and can be physically harmful to children. In conclusion, parents should encourage activities that promote personal growth and intellectual development, such as reading a book or playing strategic games like chess. These activities help children learn essential life skills while keeping them engaged and entertained."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The right-wing government being mentioned here refers to a conservative, economically liberal-leaning administration that held power for two consecutive terms. While it is not specified which particular government is being discussed, the involvement of Goldman Sachs suggests that the administration engaged in some secretive and potentially unscrupulous financial practices. Goldman Sachs is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company known for its involvement in global finance, often providing investment and consulting services to governments and large corporations. In this context, it appears that this bank collaborated with the right-wing government in question to manipulate or mask certain financial figures, potentially to promote a more favorable economic narrative or to cover up financial mismanagement. Such deceptive practices would likely erode trust in both the government and the institutions involved, raising questions about transparency, accountability, and the ethical implications of using influential financial entities to influence the public's perception of a government's performance. The statement implies that by colluding with Goldman Sachs, the right-wing government may have engaged in tactics that would ultimately be detrimental to the very foundations of a democratic society where every administration must be held responsible for its actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"General Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson was given the nickname \\"Stonewall\\" because of his stern defense at the First Battle of Bull Run (also known as the First Battle of Manassas) during the American Civil War. The battle took place on July 21, 1861, near the town of Manassas in Virginia. Confederate forces, led by General P.G.T. Beauregard and General Joseph E. Johnston, faced Union forces under the command of General Irvin McDowell. The origin of the nickname \\"Stonewall\\" traces back to an incident during the battle when General Jackson's brigade was holding a defensive line on Henry House Hill against the advancing Union troops. Confederate Brigadier General Barnard Elliott Bee Jr. observed Jackson's stern determination and unwavering resolve under intense fire. In an effort to rally and inspire his own troops, General Bee proclaimed, \\"There stands Jackson like a stone wall! Rally behind the Virginians!\\" This exclamation led to Jackson being referred to as \\"Stonewall Jackson\\" among his fellow soldiers and in subsequent accounts of the battle. The First Battle of Bull Run proved to be a significant Confederate victory and demonstrated the ferocity and brutality of the American Civil War. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's steadfast leadership and defensive tactics played a crucial role in the Confederacy's success at the battle. His resolute demeanor and courage during the fight would make the \\"Stonewall\\" nickname synonymous with his legacy as a commander. Following his impressive performance at Bull Run, Jackson would go on to become one of the most renowned Confederate generals during the Civil War. His effective use of speed, audacity, and surprise in the famous Shenandoah Valley Campaign in 1862 helped keep Union forces off balance. Additionally, his tactical prowess was a major factor in Confederate victories at battles such as Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. Unfortunately, at Chancellorsville in May 1863, General Stonewall Jackson was mistakenly shot by his own troops during a night reconnaissance mission. He would succumb to complications from his wounds and pass away on May 10, 1863. Despite his tragic and unexpected end, General Stonewall Jackson remains an iconic figure in American military history for his exceptional leadership and skill during the American Civil War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- In the mid-1970s, Gloria Estefan was studying psychology, international law and French at the University of Miami and singing with a local band on the side. She was planning to head to the Sorbonne to further her studies. But then Emilio Estefan swept her off her feet, and their band, the Miami Sound Machine, would soon sweep the nation with its Conga beat. Estefan never made it to the Sorbonne, but she launched an enduring musical career that has made her into a beloved international artist. Thirty-five years later, she remains married to that first and only boyfriend. And the seven-time Grammy winner has now released \\"The Standards,\\" an album of classic American tunes with a Gloria Estefan twist. It opens with \\"Good Morning Heartache,\\" and moves on to songs like \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me,\\" \\"What A Difference A Day Makes,\\" \\"Eu Sei Que Vou Te Amar\\" and \\"Young at Heart.\\" The album, she said, brings her career back to some of those first shaky steps onto the national stage. \\"It's such a natural thing for me, something that I wanted to do so long and 25 years ago when I danced the conga on 'The Tonight Show.' I sang 'Good Morning Heartache' with my piano player as a second song and this is like full circle,\\" Estefan said. \\"That's why it starts the record.\\" Fans know her dance hits like \\"Conga,\\" \\"Hotel Nacional,\\" \\"Wepa\\" and \\"Rhythm is Gonna Get You.\\" But there's something about the ballads -- \\"Coming out of the Dark\\", \\"Higher\\" -- that make the heart ache. 1.

They have a beaker of boiling water, a beaker of ice water, and a beaker of water at room temperature. But I can use this background: A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers. What is an answer for this question: If the students move the thermometer from one beaker to another and the mercury levels rise, is the temperature higher or lower? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The temperature is higher. If the mercury levels rise in the thermometer, it means that the temperature of the liquid in the second beaker is higher than in the first one because the mercury expands and rises in the tube when heated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Moreover, the text clarifies that the Classic Controller and GameCube controller can be utilized in playing Virtual Console games, apart from a minority of TurboGrafx-16 titles that do not support this feature. This ability to use alternative controllers for older games can enhance the retro gaming experience on the Wii platform, offering players a more authentic and comfortable feel as they revisit classic titles. In conclusion, while not universally applicable to every Wii game, the GameCube controller can be used for a number of Wii games, as well as for most titles offered on the Virtual Console. For individuals seeking a traditional control scheme or wanting to leverage their existing GameCube controller stash, this compatibility offers versatility and convenience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: how to keep your pipes from freezing in the winter","completion":"Keeping your pipes from freezing in the winter involves multiple steps and considerations. Frozen pipes can lead to water damage, so it's a very important task to perform well. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to approach this: 1. **Insulate the Pipes**: The first and most important way to prevent the pipes from freezing is by insulating them. There are materials available like foam rubber or fiberglass sleeves that can insulate your pipes and help keep the temperature from falling. Why this step important? It reduces heat transfer and keeps your pipes warmer. 2. **Seal the Cracks and Openings**: If there are any cracks or openings in your walls, you should seal them to prevent cold air from reaching the pipes. This can be done with caulk or spray foam to keep out cold air. Why this step important? It prevents cold air from accessing the pipes directly. 3. **Let the Faucet drip**: If you're expecting a particularly cold night, let your faucet drip slightly. This helps relieve pressure in the system and prevents pipes from freezing. Why this step is important? Moving water in the pipes will prevent it from freezing, and releasing the pressure helps in case the water does freeze, to prevent the pipe from bursting. 4. **Use Heating Tape**: For pipes that are easily accessible, like pipes under a sink, apply heating tape. It acts like an electric blanket for your pipes, providing heat directly to them to keep them from freezing. Why this step important? It directly warms the pipes and prevents the temperature from dropping down. 5. **Keep the Heat On**: No matter if you are at home or not during a cold period, it's better to leave the heat on as it helps to keep the pipes warm. Why this step important? Leaving the ambient temperature at a comfortable level can prevent the overall temperature of the pipes from dropping too low. 6. **Open Cabinet Doors**: Opening cabinet doors, particularly those under sinks, can allow the heat from your home to reach the pipes and keep them warmer. Why this step important? It allows heat exchange to occur more easily and keeps hidden pipes at a warmer temperature. By following these steps, you can help prevent your pipes from freezing in the winter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: The Spirit of St. Louis Movie plot: On the night before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic, Charles Lindbergh (James Stewart) lies awake in his hotel bed, worrying about his chances. Will he have enough fuel? Will he even be able to take off? Rain falls outside his window, dimming the chances for an early start. Time is short, and Lindbergh knows he must make his attempt soon, because there are others trying to make the same flight.Tossing and turning, he thinks back to the events that led him here. Once, flying airmail for the Army, his plane failed in a Midwest blizzard, and after bailing out, he had to find his way through the dark and take a train to his destination. Lindbergh was no stranger to the dangers of flight, but his faith in its capabilities was unshakable, and a dream formed in his mind: he wanted to do something remarkable, something that would show people what airplanes could really do.Back at his home base in St. Louis, he calls a New York aircraft builder to get a quote on a special plane. One that can make a very long distance flight: New York to Paris, non-stop. Lindbergh next sets out to raise the money needed to buy it, and manages to get several St. Louis businessmen interested. They like the idea, and they see its value, but aren't sure about Lindbergh's chances. Is he really sure he can do this? He convinces them that he can, and the name \\"The Spirit of St. Louis\\" is coined for the project.Lindbergh travels to New York to purchase the special plane, but the deal falls through and he returns home, discouraged. Another possible builder is found however, and Lindbergh is off to California to see the small Ryan Aircraft Co. He locates the sleepy little factory and finds the firm's president Frank Mahoney (Bartlett Robinson) frying fish with a torch. Amused, Lindbergh makes the deal, and they all get to work. In a few weeks, a little silver plane has taken shape, and Lindbergh takes it up for testing. Satisfied, he heads back to St. Louis, but learns that another team has taken off from Paris and is trying to make it... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Spirit of St. Louis,\\" there is no specific mention of Charles Lindbergh finding a medal. However, it is important to note that after completing his historical solo flight across the Atlantic, Lindbergh was awarded numerous medals and honors in recognition of his achievement. One of the most prominent medals he received was the Medal of Honor, the highest military award presented by the United States for personal acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty. The movie focuses on the events leading up to Lindbergh's famous flight and his unwavering determination and perseverance to achieve his dream. It highlights the many challenges and obstacles he faced, from dealing with harsh weather conditions to convincing potential investors of his vision. As Lindbergh moved closer to realizing his goal, he overcame financial setbacks and technical problems to eventually purchase the plane, \\"The Spirit of St. Louis.\\" These achievements and setbacks, rather than any specific medals found by Lindbergh, form the basis of the movie's narrative. The film serves as an inspiring portrayal of Lindbergh's journey, demonstrating that persistence and dedication can lead to incredible outcomes. As a result, the movie can be considered an investment worth considering if the potential audience appreciates historical biographical stories that emphasize the triumph of the human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whispers of suspicion start to spread, but many residents remain fiercely loyal to Ignacio. As tensions grow, Ignacio's daughter, Isabella, returns home from studying abroad. She is eager to reconnect with her father but unwittingly becomes close friends with Carlos. Carlos confides in Isabella and reveals a dark, hidden secret: Ignacio was once a notorious crime boss known as \\"El Lobo\\" responsible for a series of high-profile heists and brutal crimes. He had staged his death and reemerged as the admired Ignacio, having left all criminal ties behind. Act III: Overwhelmed by this revelation, Isabella confronts her father. Initially denying the claims, Ignacio eventually confesses his truth, explaining that his life change resulted from a divine experience that compelled him to seek redemption for his past atrocities. Devastated by her father's secret past, Isabella's relationship with Ignacio becomes strained, leaving him feeling isolated and abandoned. Meanwhile, Carlos, who is revealed to be a former member of Ignacio's criminal gang, orchestrates one last threatening situation in which Ignacio must choose between protecting his town or returning to his criminal roots. Act IV: Ultimately, Ignacio chooses to protect El Sol and its residents, surrendering himself to the authorities to face the crimes of his past. Carlos, realizing that Ignacio's transformation is genuine, unexpectedly helps Ignacio make the sacrifice and also surrenders to the authorities, finally finding closure. The town is left to grapple with the truth and reconciles with the knowledge that Ignacio, though flawed, genuinely cared for his community. Isabella, having discovered her father's true nature, comes to forgive him and carries on his philanthropic work, ensuring his legacy lives on through love and compassion. Conclusion: \\"Shards of Ignacio\\" is a story of redemption, forgiveness, and solidarity in the face of grave revelations. It teaches us that people can change and that exposing a hidden truth can lead to healing and the potential for a better future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that said Solti is tense at rehearsals?, using the article: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse. He is very tense at rehearsals, which makes us concentrate, but relaxed during the performance, which is a great asset to the..., what would be the answer ?

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. Let me explain both questions separately. 1. Why does the Indian Government need Rs 2000 notes? The Indian Government introduced the 2000-rupee note to replace the older 1000-rupee note. The main reason was to improve the money management in the country. Imagine you have a big piggy bank, but you can only save coins. Now think of having a bigger piggy bank where you can save bigger coins or even notes. The Rs 2000 note is like that bigger piggy bank. It helps people save more money in less space and makes it easier for everyone to carry. 2. How do people with narcissistic personality disorder choose whom to marry? Narcissistic personality disorder is like when someone loves themselves a lot and thinks they are very important. These people may choose their life partners based on how the other person makes them feel or how they think the other person will make them look even more important. Imagine, if you like chocolate ice cream a lot, you may want to have more chocolate ice cream around you all the time. Similarly, people with narcissistic personality disorder may want to marry someone who makes them feel even better about themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

His middle name was given after the South African city of Pretoria, where British troops were fighting the Boer War at the time of his birth. He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters. Conacher scored the first goal in Pirates history on American Thanksgiving Day Thursday November 26, 1925, against the Boston Bruins. He scored nine goals in 33 games in 1925-26, then returned to Toronto to play professional baseball with the Toronto Maple Leafs. An outfielder on the team, Conacher and the Maple Leafs won the International League championship then defeated the Louisville Colonels to win the Little World Series. He returned to Pittsburgh for the 1926-27 NHL season, but was dealt early in the year to the New York Americans in exchange for Charlie Langlois and 2,000. The trade nearly proved disastrous for Conacher. He scored 8 goals in 1926-27 and improved to 11 in 1927-28, but playing for a team owned by notorious bootlegger Bill Dwyer resulted in his becoming a heavy drinker. Conacher served as player-coach in 1929-30, but his play and health had deteriorated. Two events in that off-season saved Conacher: he swore off alcohol completely upon the birth of his first child, and his playing rights were sold to the Montreal Maroons. Conacher periodically struggled with Montreal, and at one point was placed on waivers with no other team willing to take over his contract. Nonetheless, his overall play and point totals increased for three consecutive seasons with the Maroons, peaking at 28 points in 1932-33. He was named to the Second All-Star Team that season, but was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for Teddy Graham. Conacher was a key figure in the club's first-ever Stanley Cup victory that season. He finished second to the Canadiens' Aurel Joliat in the voting for the Hart Trophy and earned a spot on the NHL's First All-Star Team. On Wednesday October 3, 1934, Conacher was involved in one of the largest transactions in league history. He was dealt to the Montreal Canadiens, along with Leroy Goldsworthy and Roger Jenkins in exchange for Montreal superstar Howie Morenz, Lorne Chabot and Marty Burke. The deal was only part of a series of trades involving four teams that represented one of the biggest deals in NHL history. Immediately following the Chicago trade, Conacher was sent back to the Maroons, along with Herb Cain, in exchange for the rights to Nelson Crutchfield. Conacher spent his last three NHL seasons with the Maroons and won his second Stanley Cup in 1935. He ended his hockey career after the team was eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Rangers on April 23, 1937. That final year he was runner-up to Babe Siebert in the 1937 Hart Trophy voting and was placed on the NHL Second All-Star Team.

As the Sultan leaves, the trail of a burrowing rabbit crosses the desert towards the cave. Hassan spots the burrow tunneling under the entrance of the cave and attempts to chase out the intruders, but has trouble remembering the command to open the door. Inside the cave, Bugs Bunny and his traveling companion Daffy Duck emerge from the burrow, believing they have arrived at Pismo Beach. Daffy's complaints about travelling underground (\\"What a way for a duck to travel; underground!\\") and that they're at the wrong place are silenced when he spots the riches. Determined to keep it all for himself, he stomps repeatedly on Bugs to force him back into the burrow. Meanwhile, Hassan finally says the correct command to open the door and marches in. He is met by Daffy, who is wheeling a cart full of loot. Mistaking Hassan for a \\"redcap\\" (porter), Daffy asks him to call a cab. In response, Hassan brings his sword down on Daffy's head, splitting in half both the diamond-adorned hat he is wearing and a single feather underneath. Daffy chuckles nervously before he flees in terror and uses a large gem to try bribing Bugs into saving him, but Bugs is only concerned with dusting himself off from the earlier abuse from Daffy. Hassan rushes towards them both, sword raised. Daffy hides and tells Hassan to chop the rabbit, but Bugs has disguised himself to be a genie in a bottle and fools Hassan with a rich offer for releasing him. Hassan does, taking no notice of Daffy's attempt to expose Bugs. Bugs tells Hassan the treasure is his to claim. Daffy sardonically mocks Bugs for allowing Hassan access to the treasure he wanted for himself. Outside the cave, Bugs surveys the desert and concludes he is in the wrong place. Suddenly, Daffy runs out of the cave carrying a large gem. Hassan is in hot pursuit, enraged over the duck's efforts to lay claim to the treasure. Daffy begs Bugs to save him,...

Melania Trump, the former model and reluctant first lady, often lets her fashion choices do the talking for her. Since her belated move into the White House in June, Melania Trump hasn’t yet announced an issue, or even an area of interest, for which she plans to advocate from her powerful platform. She has made few public speeches or statements, beyond introductions at campaign rallies she attends with her husband. But she’s dutifully stepped into the silent role of enhancing her husband by appearing impeccably and appropriately dressed by his side. Story Continued Below “Classy and conservative,” were the reviews from the local Saudi Arabian press after the first lady landed in Riyadh last spring dressed in a black, belted jumpsuit. The deep red Christian Dior “bar suit” she wore to visit Paris for Bastille Day in July was deemed to be a culturally appropriate choice highlighting an icon of French fashion. But on Tuesday, she appeared to put the wrong foot forward when she boarded Marine One, en route to visit emergency responders in hurricane-ravaged Texas, wearing towering black snakeskin stilettos. The emblematic first image of the first lady heading off to visit a hurricane in heels — a moment that the president has seized on as an opportunity to project strength and show off decisive leadership — instead became another symbol of a White House that can often seem out of touch.

Lisa Kline, who worked as a stylist to vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during the 2008 election, said in an interview she thought “it was a mistake in the message it relays. A lot of eyes were on them. They’re going to a devastated area. She should be dressed accordingly.” The heels at least temporarily stole the spotlight from a gloomy president who aides said has been buoyed by what he sees, so far, as an effective coordinated response to a record-breaking storm. “Tan suit looks pretty good today, doesn’t it?” Valerie Jarrett, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted, referring to the Republican outcry over Obama’s summer look to discuss serious national security issues at a news conference in 2014. Former first lady Michelle Obama also created her own fashion scandal in 2009, when she wore a pair of 540 Lanvin sneakers to volunteer at a food bank in Washington. “Small gestures send big messages,” journalist Jamil Smith wrote on Twitter, regarding the first lady’s shoe choice. “It isn’t that they keep getting it wrong. They don’t care about getting it right.” On board Air Force One to Corpus Christi, as the picture of the delicate heels ricocheted across the Internet, Melania Trump changed into a pair of bright, white sneakers, which looked fresh out of the box. She wasn’t the only female member of the Trump delegation wearing footwear that raised eyebrows — two other women were spotted on Air Force One wearing pumps and suede heels. The debate over the first lady’s shoes wasn’t an isolated fashion faux pas for the women who act as the face of the Trump administration. A week after her father’s inauguration in January, Ivanka Trump posted a picture of herself wearing a 5,000 silver Carolina Herrera gown — the same night protests erupted at airports across the country over Trump’s executive order banning refugees from majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. People close to the first daughter said at the time she felt “terrible” about the dissonance between the image projected from her Kalorama mansion and the painful photographs of refugees being detained at international airports. But the picture still lives on her public Instagram account, where it has been applauded with more than 266,000 “likes.” Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, seemed to relish her distance from the average, middle-class American woman when she posted a Jackie O.-inspired snap of herself on Instagram, while accompanying her husband on a “day trip” to Kentucky earlier this month aboard a government plane. In the photo, Linton tagged all of the designer labels she was sporting, including her Hermes scarf and her Valentino rockstud heels. She then lashed out with snide vitriol at a mother of three from Oregon who expressed distaste at her public post. An apology came later, via a crisis-managing publicist, in which Linton called the post and her comments “highly insensitive.” There was no acknowledgment from the White House that the first lady’s storm attire was at all off-key. Instead, her staff blamed the media for creating a “sad” side circus to an otherwise somber day. “It’s sad that we have an active and ongoing natural disaster in Texas,” said Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady, “and people are worried about her shoes.” Later Tuesday, the first lady’s office released a statement on the storm. “I want to be able to offer my help and support in the most productive way possible, not through just words, but also action,” the first lady said. “What I found to be the most profound during the visit was not only the strength and resilience of the people of Texas, but the compassion and sense of community that has taken over the state. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with the people of Texas and Louisiana.” ||||| Vanessa Friedman ON THE RUNWAY When is a shoe not just a shoe? When it is a pair of very high, needle-thin heels worn by the first lady of the United States on her way to the site of a natural disaster. Then it becomes a symbol for what many see as the disconnect between the Trump administration and reality; another example of the way in which this president and his family continue to define “appropriate” their own way; and an excuse for partisan name-calling. Or so became apparent Tuesday morning when President Trump and his wife left the White House to fly to Texas for a briefing on the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, and Mrs. Trump appeared on the lawn in black pegged trousers, black shades, an olive green bomber jacket — and her stilettos, now a trademark. Very much the same kind of shoes, in other words, she has been wearing since long before she joined her husband on the campaign trail. Though by the time the plane had landed Mrs. Trump looked altogether more grounded, in white sneakers and crisp white shirt, with a ponytail pulled through a black baseball cap emblazoned with the word “FLOTUS,” during her time in the air the original shoes went from being mere footwear to objects of vilification thanks to social media’s specific kind of alchemy. Nothing says I'm in touch with the people like... https://t.co/ZD6cEfG0LS — Todd Stashwick (@ToddStashwick) August 29, 2017 In response to the critical reaction, Stephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump’s communications director, emailed the following statement: “It’s sad that we have an active and ongoing natural disaster in Texas, and people are worried about her shoes.” The president and Mrs. Trump arriving in Corpus Christi, Tex., on Tuesday. Doug Mills / The New York Times That’s a fair point, to a certain extent. Certainly there was a backlash to the backlash, with Chelsea Handler, for example, being attacked in turn for her tweet attacking Mrs. Trump’s spikes. Not to mention some partisan crowing about the sneakers. Look at that - Melania in Jeans/Sneakers - Fake News Strikes Out again. Thank you POTUS & FLOTUS for showing support to the people of TX! pic.twitter.com/vqLw727ISy — DARSAVMO (@darsavmo) August 29, 2017 But to dismiss all this as merely much ado about heels, or an example of the pettiness of our divided electorate, is to ignore the reality of the current conversation around the president — to pretend not to notice how sensitized everyone has become to his unpredictable reactions to major events, and to deny the power of the telling detail to invite applause, condemnation or misinterpretation. It is precisely the superficial nature of clothing, the fact that garments are immediately accessible to all, that makes them the go-to stand-in for more nuanced, complicated emotions and issues. Mrs. Trump’s heels, after all — they appear to be classic Manolo Blahniks — are redolent of a certain clichéd kind of femininity: decorative, impractical, expensive, elitist (all adjectives often associated with the brand “Trump”). That they also are part of the identity the first lady brought to Washington — that her comfort level and ability to walk in exactly the kind of shoes that cause other women, wearing more solid shoes, to wince and crunch their toes in imaginary pain was part of her narrative and image from the start — does not obviate the fact that they have also come to represent her remove, for both good and ill. Women in the capital are generally more associated with sensible pumps than teetering patent leather numbers. This Mrs. Trump understands, which is why she changed into a more suitable costume (I use that word deliberately) for her arrival in Corpus Christi, Tex. The problem is that, as first lady, in an environment as fraught as the current one, there is no such thing as offstage. Even boarding a plane becomes a quasi-official moment in which all messaging, spoken or assumed, is mined for meaning. Mrs. Trump clearly knows this to a certain extent and has accepted it as an exigency of her job; how else to interpret the Dolce & Gabbana black lace coat and veil she wore to visit the pope on the president’s first foreign tour, or the classic red Dior suit she chose for her arrival in France for Bastille Day? Or the fact that, while hosting Akie Abe, the first lady of Japan, on Mrs. Abe’s visit to Mar-a-Lago, she wore flat sandals for their tour of the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens? (When in Florida. ...) The sharp point of the stilettos is that this kind of proactive analysis needs to be applied as consistently as possible across all public appearances (which, when you are in the White House, is all appearances). In Mrs. Trump’s job, as in her husband’s, details matter. Even shoes. Put your best foot forward, and all that. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of something.

(A) glass window (B) rubber band A:","completion":"The answer your students should choose for this logic test is (B) rubber band. The scenario presented in the test involves Bill dropping a rock onto a glass window and a rubber band. The question asks which object will not break as a result. When analyzing the potential outcomes of these two distinct materials reacting to the impact of a rock, we can consider their inherent properties and typical behavior. 1. Glass Window: Glass is a rigid, brittle material that is commonly known to be prone to breaking or shattering upon impact, especially when subjected to considerable force. In this case, the force exerted by a rock falling onto the glass window could very likely cause it to break, particularly if the area of impact is a weak point in the structure of the glass. 2. Rubber Band: Rubber, on the other hand, is a flexible, elastic material that possesses the ability to stretch and deform in response to applied forces. Due to its elastic nature, a rubber band is more capable of absorbing and dispersing the force of a falling rock without breaking. It can handle the impact by deforming, and then returning to its original shape after the force has been removed. Based on this comparative analysis of the two materials, it is reasonable to deduce that the rubber band would be more likely to remain intact and not break when placed under the force of a falling rock. Consequently, the correct logical answer your students should choose is option (B) rubber band, since it is the object that would not break in this scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many women in the developing world do not have access to contraception or maternal care. According to the United Nations Population Fund, three out of five women giving birth in South Asia do so without a skilled birth attendant on hand. In Indonesia, the average family earns the equivalent of 8 a day, according to the International Monetary Fund. But a baby delivery costs about 70 at a hospital, and a Caesarian section can cost as much as 700. Lim believes Indonesia's high maternal and infant mortality rates are caused in part by these costs, which many women cannot meet. \\"The situation is bad ... babies are unattended, deliveries have become commercialized, and mothers die from hemorrhage after childbirth because they can't afford proper care,\\" Lim told CNN earlier this year. The CNN Hero of the Year was chosen by the public after an 11-week vote on CNN.com. For being named Hero of the Year, Lim will receive 250,000 for her cause. That's in addition to the 50,000 that she and the rest of the top 10 Heroes each received for making the top 10. This is the fifth year that CNN, with the help of entertainers and other celebrities, have honored everyday people changing the world. Among this year's presenters were comedians Jerry Seinfeld and George Lopez; actors J.R. Martinez and Chris Colfer; musical artists Ice Cube and will.i.am; model Christy Turlington Burns; former NFL quarterback Kurt Warner; and actresses Laura Dern, Mary-Louise Parker and Sofia Vergara. (Photos: Scenes from the night) Kid Rock performed the song \\"Care\\" from his platinum-selling album \\"Born Free,\\" while Miley Cyrus sang her triple-platinum hit \\"The Climb.\\" Turlington Burns introduced Lim's video tribute during Sunday's show, before the Hero of the Year announcement. As founder of Every Mother Counts, she is also a passionate advocate for maternal health around the world. \\"Eight years ago, after giving birth to my first child Grace, I felt what could have been a life-threatening complication,\\" she told the audience of nearly 5,000. \\"It suddenly got very scary, very fast. If I hadn't received the expert care in the hospital birthing center I was in, then I may have not been so fortunate. \\"My wish is that every mother all over the world has the same chance surviving childbirth I had. My friend Robin Lim shares that wish and she spends her days and nights making it so.\\" Photos: See how Lim helps thousands of women Turlington Burns recently made the trip to Indonesia to meet Lim and see her work firsthand. Lim became a midwife after her sister -- and her sister's baby -- died from complications during childbirth several years ago. She and her husband then sold their home in Hawaii and moved to Bali to \\"reinvent their lives,\\" she said. \\"It was there she learned she could make a difference,\\" Turlington Burns said. \\"She opened a clinic, Bumi Sehat, so poor mothers can give birth safely and be treated with dignity and respect. She has delivered thousands of babies, and that is why they call her 'Ibu' -- Mother.\\" After being announced as the CNN Hero of the Year, a tearful Lim accepted the award from host Anderson Cooper and made an impassioned plea for help. \\"Today on our Earth, 981 mothers in the prime of their life will die -- and tomorrow again and yesterday,\\" she said. \\"And I'm asking you to help change that. We don't even know how many babies are lost, but all of us can help change that.\\" Miss the show? Don't worry, you can catch it later this month.

Today, Serato provides dinner seven days a week to more than 300 children at the Boys & Girls Club in Anaheim, California. Richard St. Denis Since 2008, Richard St. Denis and his organization, World Access Project, have provided hundreds of wheelchairs and mobility aids to people living with disabilities in rural Mexico. Amy Stokes Amy Stokes is redefining \\"family\\" for South African children affected by HIV/AIDS and poverty. Her organization, Infinite Family, has connected almost 500 teenage \\"Net Buddies\\" with nearly 300 volunteer mentors from all over the world via the Internet. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Robin Lim, an American woman, was named the 2011 CNN Hero of the Year for her work in helping thousands of poor Indonesian women have healthy pregnancies and births through her Yayasan Bumi Sehat health clinics. Known as \\"Mother Robin\\" or \\"Ibu Robin\\" by locals, she offers free prenatal care, birthing services, and medical aid in Indonesia, where many families cannot afford care. Lim and the other top 10 selected heroes received 50,000, while Robin Lim was awarded an additional 250,000 for being CNN Hero of the Year. Her focus on providing assistance to pregnant women in Indonesia is crucial, as the country's high maternal and infant mortality rates are partly due to the high costs of delivery and Caesarian sections, which many individuals cannot afford."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When I was nine years old, I loved to go fishing with my dad. But the only thing that wasn't very fun about it was that he could catch many fish while I couldn't catch anything. I usually got pretty upset and kept asking him why. He always answered, \\"Son, if you want to catch a fish, you have to think like a fish\\", I remember being even more upset then because, \\"I'm not a fish!\\" I didn't know how to think like a fish. Besides, I reasoned, how could what I think influence what a fish does? As I got a little older I began to understand what my dad really meant. So, I read some books on fish. And I even joined the local fishing club and started attending the monthly meetings. I learned that a fish is a cold-blooded animal and therefore is very sensitive to water temperature. That is why fish prefer shallow water to deep water because the former is warmer. Besides, water is usually warmer in direct sunlight than in the shade. Yet, fish don't have any eyelids and the sun huts their eyes... The more I understood fish, the more I became effective at finding and catching them.. When I grew up and entered the business world, I remember hearing my first boss say, \\"We all need to think like sales people.\\" But it didn't completely make sense. My dad never once said, \\"If you want to catch a fish you need to think like a fisherman.\\" What he said was, \\"You need to think like a fish.\\" Years later, with great efforts to promote long-term services to people much older and richer than me, I gradually learned what we all need is to think more like customers. It is not an easy job. I will show you how in the following chapters.

Apparently working under the impression that they understand the science of sexuality better than the World Health Organization or the American Medical or Psychological or Psychiatric associations, Texas Republicans made a bold statement last weekend. With zero debate, they adopted a party platform that includes support for a widely discredited form of mental health \\"treatment\\" known as \\"reparative therapy.\\" Also called \\"conversion therapy,\\" this dangerous pseudo-medical practice aimed at transforming homosexuals into heterosexuals has been widely demonstrated to be both ineffective and harmful, not to mention offensive. The clearly misguided assumption underlying such therapy is the belief (often reinforced by self-serving interpretations of any number of religious texts) that homosexuality is a disease. However, much like drapetomania (the pseudo-scientific \\"disease\\" an enterprising white man conveniently identified in the mid-19th century was described as the condition that led black slaves to attempt escape), homosexuality is in fact not an illness, but rather a fact of human nature. And rejecting human nature can have devastating effects on the psyche, demonstrating that if there is a real disease that needs fixing here, it's homophobia, not homosexuality. By explicitly supporting such pseudo-therapy, the OPTIONS: - American Medical has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Melody Moezzi has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Moezzi has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Psychiatric has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Republicans has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Texas has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Texas GOP has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - World Health Organization has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - drapetomania has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce.","completion":"So, some people in Texas who are part of a big group called Republicans decided that they know more about people's feelings and who they love than big important groups like the World Health Organization and the American Medical group. They said they support something called \\"reparative therapy,\\" which is kind of like a fake treatment that some people think can change who someone loves. But those important groups I mentioned earlier say that this therapy is not good and can actually hurt people. You see, some people think that liking someone of the same gender is not normal and is like being sick, but that's not true. It's just a part of how some people are. Imagine if someone told you that liking ice cream is a disease and you needed to be \\"cured\\" - that would be pretty silly, right? The people in Texas who support this fake treatment are not looking at the real science and they might even be making things worse for those who they want to \\"cure.\\" It's important to remember that everyone is different and it's okay to love whomever you want. So, what we should really try to understand and change is not how people love, but how some people don't accept others for who they are."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on... Question: Why are critics accusing Trump of a violation?

Direction must be the problem here. I recently heard John Cleese speaking of working a skit for Fawlty Towers. He was supposed to attack his car with a branch.

This sort of attention to detail is missing from \\"Corky Romano\\". No matter how embarrassingly unfunny a comic bit was, it wasn't fixed, and wasn't left on the cutting room floor. The one value I can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie which somehow escaped into distribution without being repaired. I've scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews praising this absolute waste of time bolsters my suspicion that some people are getting paid to promote titles.

'First time here': This phrase by itself does not contribute much to the sentiment but the following sentences make it clear that the first-time experience was a positive one. 2. 'Saturday night and was actually not crowded at all. Got seated right away': These statements imply a pleasant surprise with the experience not being crowded and having to wait, which would typically be expected on a Saturday night at most dining establishments. 3. 'Waitress was very very friendly and nice': This emphasizes a positive interaction with the staff, further enhancing the positive sentiment of the review. 4. 'The food was delivered quick and OMG was it good!': Expressing the quality of food and the service. The use of the phrase \\"OMG was it good!\\" is exclamatory and indicates strong positive feelings towards the food. 5. 'I will definitely come back again!!! Love it!': These statements usually indicate both satisfaction with the experience, translated in the willingness to repeat it, and a strong emotional response identified in the phrase 'love it,' conveyed through enthusiastic terminology and the use of exclamation marks for emphasis.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Skid Row is an American heavy metal band, formed in 1986 in Toms River, New Jersey. The group achieved commercial success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with its first two albums Skid Row (1989) and Slave to the Grind (1991) certified multi-platinum, the latter of which reached number one on the Billboard 200. The band's third album Subhuman Race (1995) was also critically acclaimed, but failed to repeat the success of its predecessors. During this period, the band consisted of bassist Rachel Bolan, guitarists Dave Sabo and Scotti Hill, drummer Rob Affuso, and frontman Sebastian Bach. After the Slave to the Grind promotional tour, an EP of covers B-Side Ourselves was released in September 1992. Before a third album could be recorded, Skid Row took an extended hiatus in 1993 on McGhee's recommendation to wait for the grunge movement to fade away. For some time, Skid Row parted ways with Wagener, possibly due to the music taking a different direction for the follow-up to Slave to the Grind. In 1994, the band returned to the studio with producer Bob Rock to record its third album. Subhuman Race was released in March 1995, and charted in the top 40 on the American charts. Although it did not achieve the success of its predecessors, it charted one single in the US and received positive reviews. At that point, the band shifted to performing at smaller venues and its videos were rarely played on MTV, partly because of the rise in popularity of grunge and subsequent decline of many 1980s heavy metal styles. Skid Row was the opening act for Van Halen on its North American leg of the tour. Eventually, Bach left the band in late 1996 after an argument with Bolan who turned down an opening slot on the Kiss reunion tour even though Bach already booked it. Other band members told Bach that Skid Row was too big for an opening act and that they were not going to do the show. Bach then left a message on a bandmate's answering machine telling them the band was never too big to open for Kiss. Bolan had a side project, a punk band Prunella Scales who was playing at the same time as the planned Kiss show. The rift between Bach and the other band members subsequently led to him leaving Skid Row. Four years later, Skid Row was one of the opening acts for the 2000 Kiss Farewell Tour. In 1998 Skid Row released the compilation 40 Seasons: The Best of Skid Row. After Bach's departure, the remaining members continued as Ozone Monday with singer Shawn McCabe of Mars Needs Women. In 1998 and 1999, the group opened up for Kiss and Motley Crue under the new moniker. Was Bach back with them?","completion":"No, Sebastian Bach did not come back to Skid Row when they performed as opening acts for Kiss and Motley Crue in 1998 and 1999.

Having recently given birth to her beautiful baby, Emily was filled with both joy and anxiety as she faced the challenges that came with early motherhood. She found it all overwhelming – the sleepless nights, the numerous diaper changes, and the daunting responsibility of keeping her baby safe and healthy. Mary, a trusted friend and experienced mother, was the perfect person for Emily to turn to for assistance. Having already gone through the ups and downs of raising a child, Mary was well-equipped to offer timely advice and share valuable tips to make Emily's life easier. Firstly, Mary provided Emily with guidance on how to establish a routine for her baby. This included structuring feeding times, coordinating naps, and creating some semblance of a daily schedule. Emily soon learned that consistency and predictability were crucial, not only for her baby's well-being but also for managing her own expectations and sanity as a mother. Secondly, Mary encouraged Emily to pay close attention to her baby's cues and needs and respond promptly. As they spent more time together observing the baby, Emily became more attuned to understanding her baby's cries, recognizing when the baby was hungry or needed a diaper change - all of which contributed to building a strong bond between mother and child. Additionally, Mary familiarized Emily with essential baby care tasks, such as proper bathing techniques, dressing and swaddling, and even the best ways to soothe a fussy baby. Under Mary's gentle guidance, Emily began to feel more confident in her ability to nurture and take care of her precious newborn. Moreover, Mary helped Emily to understand the importance of self-care during her journey as a new mother. She reminded Emily that taking care of herself, both physically and emotionally, would allow her to be the best parent possible for her child. Mary shared techniques such as mindfulness meditation to help Emily manage stress and anxiety, and also encouraged her to reach out to other mothers, friends, and family members for emotional support when needed. Lastly, Mary served as an invaluable resource for Emily about the various milestones, growth stages, and development patterns that her baby would soon go through. Emily gained a clear understanding of what to expect in the coming months - from teething to crawling to walking - and felt more prepared to handle each phase with grace and confidence. In conclusion, Emily asking Mary for help with the baby after coming home proved to be an excellent decision as it allowed her to gain valuable knowledge, skills, and assurance in her new role as a mother. With Mary's unwavering support and guidance, Emily grew more confident and capable in meeting the many challenges of early parenthood, setting her on a successful path as she embarked on this new chapter in her life alongside her beloved child."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The lyrics of both \\"Son of Three\\" and \\"The She\\" suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, \\"Put on a Side\\", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. I am facing a new situation today: Henry is currently writing a research paper for his biology class. The subject of the paper is abiotic stress. For his paper, he is analyzing two different forests of differing stress levels and writing about the differences seen in the environments. For the area with a low level of stress Henry chose the Narshe Forest, located near the mountains of Harkal. The area of high stress that Henry will be looking at is the Midgar forest. After choosing the two areas, Henry feels he deserves a break from his paper and goes to watch a baseball game. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Will the animal population be higher or lower in the Midgar forest? A:","completion":"The animal population will likely be lower in the Midgar forest due to the higher level of abiotic stress in that area.

A popular song called Onamo , ' namo ! ( There , o'er There ! ) also existed . The educational system had an honorific song , the Hymn to Saint Sava , which was sung in the Saint 's honour . The lyrics were made in 1865 by the Serb poet and a priest named Jovan Sundei , who was the secretary of Prince Nikola I of Montenegro . The music was composed by Jovo Ivaniševi , drawing from \`\` Uskliknimo s ljubavlju '' , hymn to Saint Sava and later adapted by Anton Schulz . The anthem was first performed on October 17 , 1870 , after which Prince Nikola declared it as the state anthem . In 1993 , the anthem was one of the proposals during the unsuccessful negotiations to adopt an Anthem of the Republic of Montenegro . The main problem was its monarchist lyrics . - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The Kingdom of Serbia, often rendered as \\"Servia\\" in English sources during the time of its existence, was created when Prince Milan I of Serbia, ruler of the Principality of Serbia, was crowned king in 1882. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities. - The Great National Assembly of the Serb People in Montenegro, known as the Podgorica Assembly ( /Podgorika skupština), was an assembly of the representative body of the Montenegrin people (the Kingdom of Montenegro) in November 1918, after World War I, that was to decide whether Montenegro was to unite with the Kingdom of Serbia. It was organized by a Serbian government committee. The two sides were known as the \\"Greens\\" and the \\"Whites\\", in favour of a confederation (independence) and unification (annexation), respectively. The assembly concluded the decision to merge Montenegro with Serbia. The creation of Yugoslavia followed. - The Kingdom of Montenegro (Serbian: a a / \\"Kraljevina Crna Gora\\"), was a monarchy in southeastern Europe, present day Montenegro, during the tumultuous years on the Balkan Peninsula leading up to and during World War I. Legally it was a constitutional monarchy, but absolutist in practice. On 28 November 1918, following the end of World War I, with its government still in exile, the unconstitutional Podgorica Assembly proclaimed union with the Kingdom of Serbia, and was merged into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes three days later, on 1 December 1918. - Anglican church music is music that is written for liturgical worship in Anglican church services. What is the relationship between 'ubavoj nam crnoj gori' and 'national anthem'?","completion":"\\"Ubavoj nam Crnoj Gori\\", which translates to \\"To Our Beautiful Montenegro\\" in English, was the national and state anthem of the Kingdom of Montenegro in the late 19th and early 20th century. A national anthem is a patriotic musical composition that is generally recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. It is typically meant to evoke and eulogize the history, traditions, and struggles of a nation's people. The lyrics for \\"Ubavoj nam Crnoj Gori\\" were written in 1865 by Jovan Sundei, a Serb poet and priest, and the music was composed by Jovo Ivaniševi. The anthem was first performed on October 17, 1870, after which Prince Nikola declared it as the state anthem. This song played a key role in honoring and representing the Kingdom of Montenegro during its existence. Therefore, the relationship between \\"Ubavoj nam Crnoj Gori\\" and \\"national anthem\\" is that the former served as the national anthem for the Kingdom of Montenegro in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was the musical symbol of national identity, unity, and pride for the Montenegrin people until its merger with the Kingdom of Serbia post-World War I."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone. A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

The body's temperature increases due to the warmer environment in summer, and the hypothalamus sends signals to the body to release sweat to regulate temperature. However, the armpits, which have a high concentration of sweat glands, may not produce as much sweat during summer if certain factors indirectly affect the process: 1. Hydration: During summer, the body needs more water to produce sweat and cool itself down. If a person is dehydrated, it could lead to reduced sweating, including in the armpits. 2. Acclimatization: If an individual has been living in a hot environment for some time, the body adjusts and adapts its cooling system. This might lead to better efficiency in the sweating process and a reduced volume of sweat, including in the armpits. 3. Antiperspirants: Applying antiperspirants to the armpits can block or minimize sweating in that specific area. This effect is indirect since the product interferes with the sweat glands’ response to the hypothalamus signal. 4. Clothing: Wearing loose and breathable clothes during summer can impact the amount of sweat produced. Loose clothes allow air to circulate better, helping sweat evaporate faster and cooling the body more efficiently. This results in less need for sweat production, indirectly affecting the armpit sweat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

From the dilapidated state of LaGuardia's Central Terminal Building to the minimal public transport links and outdated air traffic control system, the metro area's airports are in desperate need of modernization. But now it's time for Biden and other leaders to put their money where their rhetoric is. The Federal Government and local politicians must step up and take sustained action. And the goal should be to fix the problem, not point fingers. Despite its outdated condition, LaGuardia serves 25 million passengers a year. As the closest airport to Manhattan, it is coveted by airlines. As such, the airports serve as a symbol for the entire","completion":"nation's infrastructure crisis. The crumbling roads, bridges, and rail systems across the United States not only threaten public safety but also hinder economic growth. If the country is to thrive, both local and federal governments must recognize the urgency of the situation and dedicate resources accordingly. In an extraordinary turn of events, the collective efforts of Vice President Joe Biden, the Federal Government, local politicians, and airline companies initiate a remarkable transformation of LaGuardia Airport. Recognizing the significance of a world-class airport for New York City and the nation, they collaborate to allocate millions of dollars toward the renovation and modernization of the facilities, ultimately aiming to serve the increasing number of passengers and meet the demands of the 21st century. Over the next decade, work begins in earnest to transform not only LaGuardia but also airports across the country, as part of a nationwide infrastructure program. The blueprint for LaGuardia's transformation consists of five key areas: reconstruction of terminals, improved air traffic control systems, increased security measures, enhanced public transportation links, and the establishment of eco-friendly practices. First and foremost, the Central Terminal Building is demolished and replaced with an architecturally stunning, state-of-the-art terminal that features better passenger flow, new amenities, dining facilities, more efficient baggage handling systems, and various accommodations for passengers requiring mobility assistance. This terminal sets the standard for airports globally, showcasing advanced technology and a focus on customer satisfaction. Next, the new air traffic control system is integrated to reduce delays caused by the outdated infrastructure. This, combined with additional runways and the implementation of \\"NextGen\\" satellite-based technology, significantly increases the overall efficiency and capacity of the airport. The security measures at LaGuardia are ramped up, with investments in advanced screening technology, dedicated security personnel, and data-sharing agreements with international partners. This ensures the safety of passengers and staff without infringing on personal privacy too heavily. To promote a more sustainable future, the new LaGuardia incorporates environment-friendly designs, such as solar panels, green roofs, and efficient waste management systems. These initiatives set an example for airports globally, as the aviation industry continues to embrace and invest in green technology. Moreover, the outdated public transportation links are revamped to address concerns and provide more efficient transport options for passengers, including new bus lines, rail systems, and improved roadways. These upgrades greatly ease congestion, minimize environmental impacts, and make traveling in and out of the airport seamless and hassle-free. The renovation of LaGuardia Airport ultimately serves as a catalyst for a nationwide initiative to modernize airports, transportation systems, and public facilities. As a result, the United States witnesses a transformative period that not only enhances passenger experience but also revitalizes the nation's infrastructure. Through the concerted efforts of government and various stakeholders, the dedication of funding, and a shared vision of progress, the story ends with a reinvigorated America boasting a robust, cutting-edge infrastructure network, ready to lead the world in the 21st century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Assisting Zionist causes Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \\"evil\\" that was undermining a third of the country's development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important. Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \\"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\\".

This tilt, known as the axial tilt or obliquity, is approximately 23.5 degrees from the perpendicular plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilting plays a crucial role in the distribution of sunlight and heat across the planet, making it the primary reason behind the differences in energy allotment received by various regions on Earth. The Earth's tilt affects the angle at which sunlight strikes the surface of the planet, which in turn affects the amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth. When one side of the Earth (Northern or Southern Hemisphere) is tilted towards the Sun, it receives more direct sunlight and experiences the warmer season known as summer. Conversely, when the same hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, it receives less direct sunlight and goes through the colder season known as winter. During the course of the Earth's annual orbit around the Sun, the variation in energy received by each hemisphere changes gradually, giving rise to transitional seasons – spring and autumn. During spring, the hemisphere gradually tilts towards the Sun, receiving more energy and warming up the temperatures, while in autumn, the hemisphere tilts away from the Sun, receiving less energy and leading to cooler temperatures. In addition to causing seasonal variations, the axial tilt also contributes to the creation of different climate zones on Earth. The planet can be divided into three primary climate zones: 1. Tropical Zone: The area around the equator (between 23.5 degrees North and 23.5 degrees South) is the tropical zone, which receives the highest amount of solar energy. This leads to generally warm temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. 2. Temperate Zone: Located between 23.5 and 66.5 degrees latitude in both hemispheres, the temperate zones have more moderate climate conditions due to the influence of both warm and cold air masses. These regions experience significant variations in temperature and precipitation throughout the year as they go through all four seasons. 3. Polar Zone: The regions near the poles (above 66.5 degrees latitude) fall under the polar zone and experience the lowest amount of solar energy. Extremely cold temperatures, long winters, and brief summers characterize these areas. In summary, Earth's tilt on its axis is the key factor determining the distribution of energy received from the Sun, driving the occurrence of different seasons and creating distinct climate zones on the planet. This axial tilt ensures that sunlight and heat are spread across the Earth's surface unevenly, leading to temperature variations and forming various weather patterns and ecosystems."},{"prompt":"Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods.

Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Available options: a). No. b). Yes. I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what are social security taxes Suggested answer: The Social Security Administration is headquartered in Woodlawn , Maryland , just west of Baltimore . Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"Social security taxes refer to the taxes paid by employees, employers, and self-employed individuals to fund Social Security programs such as retirement, disability, survivor benefits, and Medicare. It is mandatory for workers, employers, and self-employed individuals in the United States to contribute to this system, which serves as a form of financial protection for individuals and families in times of need. The Social Security Administration (SSA), headquartered in Woodlawn, Maryland (just west of Baltimore), is the United States agency responsible for administering the Social Security programs. While the location of the SSA headquarters is accurate, the suggested answer does not accurately address the question about social security taxes. A more appropriate answer to the question should focus on explaining what social security taxes are and their purpose. For instance: Social security taxes are compulsory contributions made by workers, employers, and self-employed individuals in the United States to the Social Security program. This program, administered by the Social Security Administration, provides financial benefits and support for eligible individuals and their families in various life situations, such as retirement, disability, or the death of a family member contributing to the Social Security system. Social security taxes ensure that the program remains solvent and can continue to provide crucial support to millions of Americans. The funds collected through social security taxes are split into two parts: 1. Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI): This portion of the tax covers retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. Employees and employers each pay 6.2% of the employee's wages, adding up to a total contribution of 12.4%. For self-employed individuals, the entire 12.4% is paid by them as they are considered both the employer and employee. 2. Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI): This part of the tax covers Medicare, a national health insurance program primarily for individuals aged 65 and older. Employees and employers each contribute 1.45% of the employee's wages, totaling 2.9%. Similarly, self-employed individuals pay the entire 2.9% tax. In conclusion, the suggested answer is not sufficient in addressing the question about social security taxes, as it merely provides the location of the Social Security Administration's headquarters. Instead, the answer should focus on explaining the concept of social security taxes, their purpose, and how they are collected and distributed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Four more people have died in the national meningitis outbreak, bringing the death toll to 19, health officials said Wednesday. The deaths are among the 247 people in 15 states sickened in the outbreak. They all received shots of an apparently contaminated steroid medication made by a Massachusetts specialty pharmacy. Most of the patients contracted a rare fungal form of meningitis, after getting the shots for back pain over the past few months. Two developed infections from joint injections. Of the latest deaths, two were in Tennessee and one each was reported in Florida and in Virginia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday. That brings deaths to eight in Tennessee; three in Florida and Michigan, two in Indiana and Virginia, and one in Maryland. Test results so far show infections with three kinds of fungus, most of them a form of black mold, the CDC said. Of 42 patients, 40 were infected with Exserohilum fungus. The others were infected with Aspergillus or Cladosporium. All are treated with the same anti-fungal medications. Three lots of the suspect steroid were recalled last month by the New England Compounding Center of Framingham, Mass. All the illnesses have been traced to one of those lots. Food and Drug Administration officials last week said they found fungus in 50 vials of the preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate. However, they have not said what kind of fungus they detected. On Monday, FDA officials said they are investigating two more drugs made by New England Compounding _ another steroid and a solution used during heart surgery. Initially, the FDA said two heart transplant patients who got the heart solution developed fungal infections but later said one case involved a solution made by another company. They also have cautioned there could be other explanations for the infections. ___ Online: CDC outbreak information: http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/outbreaks/meningitis.html ||||| By Marice Richter DALLAS Oct 17 (Reuters) - The number of West Nile virus cases across the United States has topped 4,500, with another 282 cases reported last week, making 2012 the nation's second-worst year on record for the mosquito-borne disease, government figures showed on Wednesday.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions are very similar, as both are asking about the presence of a black line on the nail and seeking a solution to remove it. The difference is that the first question does not provide a visual reference, while the second one mentions a picture to further clarify the issue. To help you with the issue of the black line on your nails, I will provide a step-by-step process to understand and address the problem: Step 1: Identify the cause The first step is to understand the cause of the black line on your nail. Some common reasons are: - Linear melanonychia: a pigmentation issue causing a dark line on the nail - Beau's lines: nail injury or severe illness causing horizontal ridged lines - Splinter hemorrhage: small blood clot, which can appear as a black line under the nail Step 2: Rule out potential health concerns Consult a dermatologist or healthcare professional to rule out any underlying health conditions that could be causing the black line on your nail. In some cases, a dark line could indicate a benign growth, while in rare cases, it could signal a malignant melanoma. Step 3: Treat the underlying cause If it's determined that an injury or illness contributed to the appearance of the black line, appropriate treatment for the condition should be pursued under medical guidance. If it's due to a growth or another issue, your healthcare professional will recommend necessary treatment options. Step 4: Practice good nail care Proper nail care, including keeping your nails clean and neatly trimmed, can prevent potential nail injuries and ensure healthy growth. It's also essential to maintain a balanced diet, which promotes healthy nail growth. Step 5: Patience As nails grow slowly, it may take several months for the black line to disappear completely, especially if it's due to any growth or injury that affected your nail bed.

Help as much as you can. Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

A good hairstyle can boost your self-esteem, accentuate your facial features, and even turn heads when you walk into a room. It's essential to find a hairstylist who understands your style, preferences, and expectations. In this article, we will guide you through the process of finding the perfect stylist and getting a haircut that suits you perfectly. Step 1: Shop around for a hairstylist The first step in finding the right hairstylist is to ask for recommendations. Speak to friends, family, and colleagues who have a hairstyle you admire. They can give you insights into their hairstylist's skill, personality, and expertise. Additionally, you can read online reviews or consult social media platforms to discover the best stylists in your area. Create a list of potential hairstylists and start exploring their work. Step 2: Book a consultation appointment Once you have your list of potential hairstylists, book consultation appointments with your top choices. A consultation is an essential part of the journey, as it allows you to meet the stylist and share your expectations. During this meeting, you can discuss the kind of hairstyle you want, your lifestyle, hair type, and other crucial factors. A good stylist should listen to you, analyze your hair, and give you honest advice on what will work best for you. Step 3: Bring a visual aid Pictures are worth a thousand words, especially when it comes to hairstyles. Bring a magazine or an internet picture with you to give your stylist a visual reference of the haircut you have in mind. This way, you can clearly communicate your desired hairstyle to avoid any misunderstandings or disappointments. A skilled hairstylist should be able to adapt the style in the picture to suit your facial features, hair type, and personal taste. Step 4: Communicate openly with your stylist Communication is key in ensuring you get the desired results. Be open with your hairstylist about how you normally wear your hair and your expectations. Let them know which part of styling is most important to you, whether it's the cut, color, or maintenance. Share any concerns or past experiences that have made you cautious. Remember that a good stylist will have your best interests at heart and work with you to find a solution that meets your needs. Conclusion: Finding the perfect hairstylist involves research, open communication, and a thorough consultation. By following these steps, you increase your chances of walking out of the salon with a haircut that leaves you feeling fabulous.

This can lead to problems, as these thermometers are designed for different purposes and have different temperature ranges. Using an incorrect thermometer can result in meat that is either undercooked or overcooked, potentially causing foodborne illnesses or a disappointing meal. Therefore, always read the label of the thermometer to ensure it is specifically designed for meat. Instant-Read Thermometers for Grilling For meats that cook quickly, such as ground beef patties, pork chops, and grilled chicken, an instant-read thermometer is the ideal choice. These thermometers provide quick and accurate temperature readings, usually within seconds, allowing you to monitor your meats closely and ensure they reach the optimal internal temperature for both safety and flavor. The best instant-read thermometers are digital and have a thin probe that can be easily inserted into the thickest part of the meat. Look for features such as an auto-off function and splash-proof design for added convenience and durability. Probe Thermometers for Roasting When cooking larger cuts of meat, such as whole birds, ham, beef, or lamb roasts, a probe thermometer is the preferred choice. These thermometers feature a probe that is inserted into the meat before cooking. The probe remains in the meat throughout the cooking process, while the base unit (displaying the temperature) sits outside the oven or grill. This allows for constant monitoring of the meat's internal temperature without having to frequently open the oven door or grill lid. Some probe thermometers come equipped with preset temperature settings for various types of meat, ensuring the desired level of doneness is achieved without guesswork. Others may have wireless capabilities, allowing you to remotely monitor your meat's progress from a distance. It is important to study the features offered by each probe thermometer before purchasing one that best suits your needs. Microwave-Safe Meat Thermometers If you find yourself frequently cooking meat in the microwave, it is essential to invest in a meat thermometer specifically designed for this purpose. Standard meat thermometers are typically not microwave-safe and can be damaged or cause damage to the microwave itself. There is a range of thermometers available designed specifically for microwave cooking, offering the ability to measure the temperature of your meat without posing a risk to your microwave. These thermometers often come with a heat-resistant silicone grip, ensuring that you can safely and comfortably handle the thermometer after the cooking process. Be sure to always use the targeted temperature chart that comes with the microwave-safe thermometer for safe cooking or refer to the USDA guidelines. Conclusion From instant-read thermometers for grilling to microwave-safe options, choosing the right meat thermometer for the task at hand is essential. By reading the thermometer label and selecting the appropriate tool, you can ensure your meat cooks to the perfect temperature for both food safety and delicious taste. With the right thermometer in your arsenal, you're one step closer to achieving culinary excellence and serving mouth-watering dishes to your family and friends."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was a much bigger risk to play around the table than the bench, because the","completion":"table was placed precariously close to the edge of a cliff, overlooking the vast ocean below. This didn't deter the group of friends, who were always up for a bit of danger and excitement. They had fondly named themselves \\"The Daredevils,\\" and their reputation in the small town near the coast was one of infamy and curiosity. The group consisted of five friends who were as close as family: Jack, the self-proclaimed leader; Sarah, practical and clever; Tom, the quiet and sensitive one; Emily, always full of energy and spirit; and Peter, the comic relief. It was on a balmy summer evening when they decided to take their game to the edge – literally. They were playing cards, and as the sun dipped over the horizon, casting a warm glow amidst the waning daylight, they shared stories, laughter, and anxiety, as the stakes kept growing higher. As the game progressed, a cliff-side breeze brought with it the scent of salty sea spray, which only added to the thrilling, yet precarious atmosphere. Each member of the group knew that a tactical move or even a slight nudge could send either the cards or a fellow Daredevil tumbling over the edge to their peril below. This only heightened the adrenaline rush, forcing each of them to handle the cards delicately and with explicit precision. Slowly, the crowd around them grew – the Daredevils had become somewhat of a local phenomenon, and their ever-more daring antics had captured the attention and imagination of the townspeople. Some had come to watch in awe, while others clucked their tongues disapprovingly, whispering urgent prayers to the heavens for the safety of these misguided souls. Tonight, the Daredevils took things up a notch – perhaps too far. They introduced a new element to their game: a blindfold. Each player took turns wearing the blindfold, trusting the others to accurately describe their position and surroundings and to guide them. Tensions were higher than ever before, as they relied entirely on the descriptive cues and the careful whispers of their friends – all while their hearts pounded with anticipation. Sarah was the first to wear the blindfold, swallowing a lump in her throat as darkness enveloped her. She listened attentively to the soft voices of her friends as they instructed her on how to move and strategize. Although it was a simple card game, Sarah could feel her pulse quicken as she felt the ocean breeze and knew that one wrong move would be catastrophic. The game continued, each one of them taking their turn under the blindfold. Laughs and gasps from the audience punctuated the evening, which eventually became night as the moon rose to illuminate the table. Against the bright moonlight and the sound of the waves crashing against the cliffs, they felt invincible. It was finally Jack's turn to play blindfolded. He was the boldest of the group, and also the most reckless. Trusting his friends implicitly, he quickly tied the blindfold around his eyes and confidently leaned forward, awaiting instructions. The others hesitated – they shared a glance, knowing that Jack would follow their directions without hesitation. They knew he was strong-willed enough to push the boundaries of safety, treading the fine line without fear. But they also loved their leader, and so, they decided to guide him to victory with utmost care. As the game advanced and the stakes continued to rise, the whispers of the wind and the crashing waves seemed to synchronize with their increasingly tense breaths. Jack made a crucial move, guided by his friends' hushed voices. Everyone held their breath. Suddenly, a rogue gust of wind ripped through the scene, howling around the table and sending cards flying into the abyss below. The crowd gasped, and without thinking, Jack instinctively lunged to save the cards – momentarily forgetting the blindfold and his perilous proximity to the edge. In that heart-stopping moment, the remaining four Daredevils lunged forward as well, gripping tightly onto Jack's arm and pulling him back with all their might. The blindfold fell away, and Jack stared wide-eyed over the edge of the cliff, realizing just how close he had come to certain death. The Daredevils exchanged shaky breaths, their eyes locked onto one another. They could feel the weight of the crowd's collective exhale behind them and knew that their days of playing on the edge were over. From that day forward, the group played their games on solid ground, using the experience as a reminder of how precious life was and how quickly things could change. News of their daring nights at the cliff continued to be whispered within the small coastal town, and they became a living legend – an embodiment of youth and adventure. No longer testing fate, the Daredevils learned the true value of friendship and trust. Sobered by their near-brush with disaster, they became closer, wiser, and more grounded, for they had learned that thrills, while exhilarating, came with the responsibility we hold for one another's lives, hearts, and souls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Allow me to add balance by pointing out the following: Script: Dreadful.

At one point, Dan asks, \\"Have you heard of the HIV virus?\\" and it sounds about as natural as asking, \\"Have you communicated with the nine alien races?\\" Acting: White teeth do and a chiseled face do not a sensitive performer make. Speedman did well enough with what he was given, I suppose, but Marsden was terrible -- unsympathetic, unbelievable, and downright smug and smarmy throughout his captivity. There is an emptiness to his performances (also see Interstate 60). Plot: Spare me! The moments of half-escape were not thrilling but irritating and weak. Recall Marsden pretending to try keys in the door and then throwing them down: \\"They don't work, man!\\" Tee-hee. And beware the semi black-and-white flashbacks, which are initiated with some schlocky sound taken from CSI and other crime dramas. Most important of all, most dangerous, evil, and offensive, is the homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a film in which HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says that Dan may have taken off the condom or not used it at all -- excuse me, where was Tom while they were having sex?

Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland.

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

Article: Former Heisman Trophy winner and NFL quarterback Tim Tebow made his intentions to play baseball known several weeks ago, and now he has an organization. And wouldn't you know it, he's signed with another orange and blue team, much like the Florida Gators and Denver Broncos. Tim Tebow ... Meet the Mets. We have signed OF @TimTebow to a minor league contract. He will participate in the #Mets Instructional League. pic.twitter.com/I6gmW0b6hY — New York Mets (@Mets) September 8, 2016 The AP reports that Tebow and the Mets agreed to a 100,000 signing bonus. As James Wagner notes on Twitter, 100,000 is the highest bonus a team can give to a post-draft signee without incurring penalties. To put that figure in context, signing bonus slots for 10th-round picks in 2016 ranged from 161,300 to 156,000. Tebow will continue his work as a college football analyst for the SEC Network, which will require him to be absent from instructs for at least a couple of days a week. The Mets were reportedly the only team willing to make such allowances for Tebow. As for anyone misguidedly wondering about the impact on the Mets in 2016, there is zero. Instructional leagues are where teams start the earliest stages of development on players either needing experience or long-injured players go to get back some game speed during their rehab process. Generally speaking, a player like Tebow in instructionals is far, far away from hitting the majors. As for the notion that Tebow might somehow be \\"taking someone else's spot,\\" he's not. Spots in instructionals aren't limited and most of the game action isn't even limited to regular game-type situations. The at-bats aren't really limited, nor is the time spent on any given individual. Basically, there's no real risk from a baseball standpoint for the Mets here. They are simply seeing what they can get out of a 29-year-old athlete who has flashed some upside despite being very raw.

Now we breathlessly wait to see how far his major-league dream gets. His progress during the 2017 season will go a long way toward the conclusion of that chapter. How he fares in instructionals this year doesn't really impact that, but instead simply lays the foundation for 2017 spring training and beyond. So what will constitute success for Tebow?

(Published Thursday, Sept. 8, 2016) What to Know \\"I just want to be someone to pursue what I believe in, what I'm passionate about,\\" Tebow says MLB scouts seemed impressed with his 60-yard dash time and muscled physique, but noted he still has much work to do The former Heisman-winner won a playoff game with the Denver Broncos and didn't do much in his stint with the Jets as a backup quarterback The Mets have signed former NFL quarterback and now aspiring pro baller Tim Tebow to a minor league contract that includes a 100,000 signing bonus, the team confirmed Thursday. The national sports phenom and Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will head to the Mets Instructional League in Port St. Lucie, Florida, Sept. 18 to start his professional baseball career, the team said. \\"While I and the organization are mindful of the novel nature of this situation, this decision was strictly driven by baseball,\\" Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said during a conference call. \\"This was not something that was driven by marketing considerations or anything of the sort. We are extremely intrigued with the potential Tim has.\\" Last week, the 29-year-old Tebow worked out for nearly 50 scouts from 28 Major League Baseball teams, including the Mets, in Los Angeles as he embarked on yet another chapter in his unique athletic story. The outfielder went through drills at the University of Southern California's Dedeaux Field for more than an hour, confidently chasing a dream deferred for 12 years. Declaring his football career essentially over, the 255-pound left-hander insists he is serious about becoming more than a baseball curiosity. Tebow, who once led the Denver Broncos to a hail mary playoff win and whose plane was tracked by media nationwide when he flew to New York to sign a deal with the Jets as a backup quarterback, hasn't played baseball regularly since his junior year of high school. He left early to enroll at Florida, beginning a fabled college football career that led to the 2007 Heisman and two national titles for the Gators. Celebs in the Stands: World Series Game 7 But 12 years ago, Tebow was a .494-hitting, all-county outfielder who loved hitting a baseball every bit as much as he loved leading a huddle. \\"The second-hardest decision I ever made was giving up baseball to go to the University of Florida and play football,\\" Tebow, whose choice of Florida over Alabama was the toughest, said last week. \\"There wasn't a season that went by that it wasn't something that I thought about. When I felt like I had this opportunity, I wanted to take it and pursue it with everything I had.\\" \\"The goal would be to have a career in the big leagues,\\" Tebow added. \\"I just want to be someone to pursue what I believe in, what I'm passionate about. A lot of people will say, 'But what if you fail? What if you don't make it?' Guess what? I don't have to live with regret. I did everything I could. I pushed it. I would rather be someone that could live with peace and no regret than what-if, or being scared.\\" Top Sports Photos Copyright Associated Press / NBC New York ||||| Jayson Stark thinks it is very difficult to believe the Mets' signing of Tim Tebow to a minor league contract was just a baseball decision, calling him a marketing opportunity. (1:12) Tim Tebow signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets on Thursday and will begin his professional baseball career in the fall instructional league on Sept. 19 in Port St. Lucie, Florida. Mets general manager Sandy Alderson insisted that signing Tebow, a former NFL quarterback, is not a publicity stunt. \\"While I and the organization, I think, are mindful of the novel nature of this situation, this decision was strictly driven by baseball,\\" Alderson said on a conference call with Tebow and agent Brodie Van Wagenen on Thursday to announce the agreement that includes a 100,000 signing bonus. \\"This was not something that was driven by marketing considerations or anything of the sort. We are extremely intrigued with the potential that Tim has. \\"He has demonstrated over his athletic career that he is a tremendous athlete, has got character, a competitive spirit. Aside from the age (29), this is a classic player-development opportunity for us. As an organization, we're going to provide that development opportunity for Tim.\\" The decision nonetheless was made at the highest levels of the organization -- by Alderson and chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon -- and did not intimately involve the team's baseball-operations personnel. The Mets were one of 28 teams to attend Tebow's showcase last week in Los Angeles. Tebow acknowledged his upcoming baseball journey is \\"not one that will be necessarily easy.\\" \\"I know this is a tough game,\\" Tebow said. \\"But I'm looking forward to putting in the work and I felt like this was the best fit.\\" Tebow, who hasn't played organized baseball since his junior year at Nease High School in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, in 2005, has been working out with former big league catcher Chad Moeller in Scottsdale, Arizona, since Memorial Day. Tebow spent almost two hours last week at the Southern California's Dedeaux Field running a 60-yard dash, shagging fly balls, throwing from the outfield and taking swings against former major league pitchers David Aardsma and Chad Smith in his audition for clubs. Tim Tebow will report to the fall instructional league on Sept. 19, but will be excused a couple of days each week to fulfill his commitment as a college football analyst for ESPN. AP Photo/Chris Carlson Tebow won the Heisman Trophy for the Florida Gators in 2007 and helped the team take two national championships. He played professionally for the Denver Broncos and New York Jets from 2010 to 2012. He spent training camps with the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles in 2013 and 2015, respectively, but never played in the regular season for those teams. Since 2013, Tebow has been a college football analyst for ESPN. Alderson said Tebow will be excused a couple of days each week from fall instructional league to fulfill that commitment. \\"Tim is committed to his role at SEC Network and ESPN this fall,\\" Stephanie Druley, ESPN senior vice president, event and studio production, said in a statement. \\"We have always been supportive of Tim's athletic pursuits. His new schedule will allow him to continue as a college football analyst on SEC Nation this fall.\\" Former major league pitchers Dallas Braden, who is now an ESPN analyst, and C.J. Nitkowski questioned how serious Tebow was about playing baseball based on the arrangement to give him excused days off each week. Wonder how the kid who doesn't get to go to instructs feels about Tebow breaking down a defense as opposed to taking hacks or fly balls... — Dallas Braden (@DALLASBRADEN209) September 8, 2016 I was on board with this #Tebow thing until I read he will miss multiple days per week in instructional league to do TV. No longer serious. — CJ Nitkowski (@CJNitkowski) September 8, 2016 After Tebow participates in the fall instructional league, which primarily is for teenage prospects, Alderson is not ruling out sending Tebow to the Arizona Fall League or a winter league. First, the Mets want to better gauge Tebow's readiness and determine whether it would be more beneficial to receive individual instruction during the offseason. Even if Tebow never reaches the majors, Alderson insisted this is a win for the Mets because of the example Tebow's work ethic and character will set for the minor leaguers. Still, Alderson insisted Tebow has on-field potential. \\"Any player evaluation starts with tools,\\" Alderson said. \\"From that standpoint, without grading everything out, suffice it to say Tim has been a great athlete. He has demonstrated more than rudimentary baseball skills. We think, with his commitment to success, that this is an opportunity that is worthwhile. \\"In terms of power, in terms of arm, in terms of foot speed, all of those things, we think he can be a baseball player. I think that is underscored by his competitiveness and his determination to succeed and to improve. From our standpoint, this is another opportunity for us to develop a player and see where it goes. We understand most players don't make it to the major leagues.\\" Alderson said there's no guarantee Tebow will be invited to major league camp during spring training. He also added Tebow's signing is a \\"standalone proposition\\" and unrelated to Van Wagenen representing other Mets clients, including Yoenis Cespedes -- who has an opt-out this winter -- as well as Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom. \\"Brodie represents a number of players on our team,\\" Alderson said. \\"But in the course of our conversations regarding Tim, none of those players were mentioned, none were in mind. I think Brodie is professional enough to keep all of those things separate.\\" The Mets will not be able to capitalize on Tebow's fame from a marketing standpoint, either. For that to happen, Tebow must be added to the team's 40-man roster and sign the group licensing agreement. MLB.com and Mets.com, in fact, are rejecting any fan who tries to make a custom Tebow jersey through the website. Tebow said he came close to pursuing baseball a year ago, but the Eagles' interest tabled it. \\"It's been something that I've been thinking about for a little while and came close to pulling the trigger on last year,\\" Tebow said. \\"Then, actually, when I was in the middle of going through a day of training for baseball, [then-Eagles coach] Chip Kelly called and then I had to figure that out. ... We all know how that turned out.\\" Former Broncos teammate Eric Decker, now with the New York Jets, said he \\"expected\\" Tebow to be signed. \\"When you have 30 scouts coming to your workout, someone is going to sign you,\\" Decker said. \\"We'll see how he does next spring in whatever camp it is. Best of luck to him. \\"I believe Tim has a big heart and he's a good person. He's such a competitor that this is an outlet for him. But from the outside, I can see how it looks as a publicity stunt. I mean, he's got a good gig right now with the SEC Network. I'm sure he could do a daily talk show if he wanted. He's well-liked. I think this is him being competitive, wanting to get that fire again.\\" Asked about his preferred position, Tebow said he'll take his cue from the organization. But he noted he's a lefty thrower, so there's a limit. \\"My best position is whatever they feel like it is,\\" he said. \\"I feel comfortable in the outfield. I feel comfortable at first base.\\" What would Tebow deem success during his baseball pursuit? Is it major leagues or bust? \\"I would consider success giving everything I have,\\" he said. Decker said that's the kind of teammate that Tebow has been in the past and what he expects him to be in the future. \\"Guys will have to respect what he's done during his tenure in the NFL and who he is and the college football player he was. There's going to be mixed emotions (among his new teammates), I'm sure,\\" Decker said. \\"He's going to be a good teammate. I think he's going to be very respectful. \\"He's not going to come in with a chip on his shoulder or (say), 'I'm Tim Tebow, here's the red carpet.' He's not that type of guy in my experience. Guys will respect his work ethic and the person.\\" ESPN's Darren Rovell and Rich Cimini contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","completion":"Former NFL quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy winner, Tim Tebow, has signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets to play baseball.

Where do you buy rennet? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Possible answers: [i] no [ii] yes","completion":"[i] no The two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they inquire about different aspects of cheese-making and rennet. To address the first question, although traditional cheese-making involves the use of rennet, a complex set of enzymes found in the stomach of ruminant animals like cows, sheep, and goats, there are alternatives to rennet for making cheese. These alternatives are based on non-animal sources and vegetable coagulants: 1. Vegetable-derived rennet: There are plants that have coagulating properties, such as fig tree bark, nettles, thistle, and artichoke flowers. These can be used to make vegetarian cheeses that don't require animal-derived rennet. However, they might alter the flavor of the cheese, and the resulting taste may vary from the traditional characteristics of cheese that uses animal rennet. 2. Microbial rennet: This type of rennet is derived from fungi and bacteria. Microbial rennet-producing microorganisms are cultivated in labs, resulting in coagulating enzymes similar to the ones found in animal rennet. Cheese made with microbial rennet closely resembles traditional cheese; however, it might have a slightly different texture or taste. 3. Genetically engineered rennet: Another alternative for cheese-making is the use of genetically engineered rennet. This type of rennet is produced by inserting DNA that codes for rennet-producing enzymes into yeast or bacteria. The enzymes produced by this process are very similar to animal rennet, and cheese made with this source maintains its traditional texture and flavor profile. As for the second question, you can buy rennet both online and in physical stores. Generally, specialty food stores or stores that sell cheese-making supplies will carry rennet in various forms, including liquid, tablet, and powder. Additionally, many online retailers and shops cater to cheese-makers and supply all the necessary ingredients, including rennet. Some popular online shops include The Cheese Maker, Cheese Making Supply Co., and New England Cheesemaking Supply Company. Be sure to read the product descriptions to determine which type of rennet you are purchasing, as this can drastically impact the cheese-making process and final product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Pontius Pilate offers to release either Jesus of Nazareth or Barabbas, in keeping with the Passover custom. The crowd gathered for the pardoning chooses Barabbas, and Jesus is condemned to crucifixion. Returning to his friends, Barabbas asks for his lover, Rachel. His friends inform him that Rachel has become a follower of Christ. Rachel soon returns, but she is not happy to see Barabbas. Barabbas witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus. As Jesus dies, the sky turns black, and Barabbas is shaken. He watches Christ's body sealed in the tomb. On the third morning, Barabbas finds the tomb open. Rachel tells him that Christ has risen, but Barabbas says it is an illusion, or that His followers have stolen the body. He visits the apostles; they do not know where He is, but also believe He is risen. Rachel preaches in Jerusalem about the Christ. She is stoned to death at the insistence of the priests. Barabbas returns to his criminal ways and robs a caravan transporting several of the priests. He throws stones at one of them rather than fleeing, and is captured by Roman soldiers. The law forbids Pilate from executing someone who has been pardoned, so he sentences Barabbas to lifelong slavery in the sulfur mines of Sicily. Barabbas survives this hellish existence for the next twenty years. He is chained to Sahak, a sailor who was sent to the mines for allowing slaves to escape. Sahak is a Christian. Sahak at first hates Barabbas for being pardoned instead of \\"the Master\\", but the two men eventually become friends. Over time, Sahak becomes too weak to work. As the guards are about to kill him the mine is destroyed in an earthquake. Sahak and Barabbas are the only survivors. Julia, the superstitious wife of the local prefect, considers them blessed.

Problem:[-59, -26, 35, -57, -87, 98, -9, 86, 78] Solution:","completion":"To find the absolute value of the difference between each two consecutive values in the given list, we simply subtract the second value from the first value in each consecutive pair and calculate the absolute value of the result. We will then add these values to a new list. Given list: [-59, -26, 35, -57, -87, 98, -9, 86, 78] 1. |(-26 - (-59))| = |(-26 + 59)| = |33 | 2. |(35 - (-26))| = |(35 + 26)| = |61 | 3. |(-57 - 35)| = |-57 - 35| = |-92| 4. |(-87 - (-57))| = |(-87 + 57)| = |(-30)| 5. |(98 - (-87))| = |(98 + 87)| = |185| 6. |(-9 - 98)| = |-9 - 98| = |-107| 7. |(86 - (-9))| = |(86 + 9)| = |95 | 8. |(78 - 86)| = |78 - 86| = |-8 | Now we will calculate the absolute value of negative integers: 3. |-92| = 92 4. |-30| = 30 6. |-107| = 107 8. |-8| = 8 So, the solution is: [33, 61, 92, 30, 185, 107, 95, 8]"},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

We eloped with only the two of us, our officiant, and our photographer in attendance. Before I hired the photographer, I had a meeting with her and told her that there were certain parts of my body I was very insecure about, and being plus sized, I needed a photographer who could accommodate that. She quickly told me that since she is also plus-sized, she was great at angles and editing that would flatter or hide the areas I was insecure about. I was so relieved, because I loved her work. We hired her the same day. We paid our photographer for 6 hours which included get ready, first look, ceremony, traditional, and dinner pictures which just included a toast and cake cutting. Our contract stated that our package included 300 edited images. It also states that the photos will be delivered within two months, but she has up to 90 days to deliver. Totally fine. My only request was for ONE image that wasn't watermarked so we could send out announcements. She happily agreed. When we booked her for our wedding, our package also included an engagement shoot. It was beautiful. The pics were delivered later than the stated time in the contract, but at this point they were so beautiful, I didn't care. I loved them so much, I booked her for our Christmas photos. She sent me a couple of photos with no watermark so I could send out Christmas cards, but I didn't get our album of 40 photos until February. I was pretty upset about it, but at that point, I had already paid her in full for our whole wedding. The wedding came and went, and it was beautiful. I got a few watermarked sneak peaks, and I was super excited to get the rest. I few weeks later, I contacted her about the image without the watermark so I could send out announcements. She told me she would have to edit it. She never sent it. I left it alone, because at point, it had been 6ish weeks since the wedding, and I was supposed to have them within 60 days. The 60 day mark passed and I didn't hear from her, so I sent her a message asking for an update, and she told me that they weren't ready yet. I received my pictures today after two and a half months. The sneak peaks that were watermarked were not in the album. I received a total of 152 photos. Several of which were the same photo, just one in color, and one in black in white. If you include the sneaks which I don't have yet, I've received about 160 photos. And they are not good AT ALL. They are horribly unflattering, crooked, off centered, and she didn't even edit out things like a pimple on my husband's face. Very basic things. Some of them are so unflattering, I don't even feel comfortable showing other people. They're so bad they brought me to tears. And it's even worse because I only have HALF of the pictures I was promised to pick from. AITA for sending her an email and telling her how unhappy I am?

It can be argued that an early example of an elected head of government would be George Washington, who was elected as the first President of the United States in 1789. In that case, the second head of government elected would be John Adams who succeeded George Washington and became the second President of the United States in 1797. However, this question can be interpreted in different ways, as it does not specify the country or criteria for determining who counts as an elected head of government.

At least 17 people were injured when a man lit a firebomb inside the Tsuen Wan Line train at 7.14pm, according to police. Flames and smoke quickly filled the carriages, prompting a mad rush off the train and for the exits. Ray Chau, a 27-year-old interior designer, said smoke quickly spread through the train, with one person literally left on fire. “When the train reached Tsim Sha Tsui, people immediately dashed out from the carriages. It was chaotic, like a scene out of Train to Busan,” Chau said, referring to a part in the 2016 zombie horror-thriller film when train passengers fight off the fictional creatures. At least 15 injured in blaze as man attempts to ‘throw Molotov cocktail’ on Hong Kong MTR train “I saw a spark two compartments away, there was a lot of smoke ... smoke in one compartment quickly filled the entire train,” Chau said. “The train journey felt particularly long ... there was nothing we could do but inhale the smoke.” Chau said he saw a burns victim upon arriving at the injured-packed platform. “One man was completely on fire, his long trousers became shorts ... he crawled and fell, others helped to put out the fire,” he said. A 23-year-old woman, who identified herself only as Ling, said she remembered hearing the train captain say: “What is it? What is it?” over the public announcement system. Just seconds later smoke filled the compartment, but she was unable to see exactly what caused the incident. Video clips provided by Chau to the Post showed the Tsim Sha Tsui station platform packed with passengers after the blaze. People filled the escalators and staircases in an effort to leave. Torn newspaper could be seen scattered across the floor of the station. Another passenger, surnamed Lam, said she heard passengers screaming as thick smoke started to push its way into her carriage. Police cordoned off the pedestrian crossings at the junction of Nathan Road and Haiphong Road, where emergency vehicles lined both sides of the street. Tsim Sha Tsui station was closed immediately following the incident, and a free shuttle was ­provided by the MTR for passengers heading ­towards Jordan and Yau Ma Tei. Train service updates continued broadcasting in Tsim Sha Tsui station at regular intervals, despite there being no passengers, but instead scores of police officers, firefighters, cleaning personnel and media workers. “Because of an incident at Tsim Sha Tsui, the train service on the Tsuen Wan line between Central and Tsuen Wan Station is running at four-minute intervals and will not stop at Tsim Sha Tsui Station,” a female announcer said. “Staff are handling the situation. Please consider using other transport ...

Hong Kong authorities say they have arrested a man for arson after a fire broke out in a subway car injuring thirteen people. (Apple Daily via AP) HONG KONG OUT, TAIWAN OUT, ONLINE... (Associated Press) HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong authorities have arrested a man for arson after a fire broke out in a subway car during rush hour Friday in a busy tourist district, injuring 18 people, two of them critically. Police said there was no evidence to indicate the fire was a terror attack. Police District Commander Kwok Pak-chung said the 60-year-old man told rescuers as he was being taken to a hospital that he was the one who set the fire, and that he had done so for an unspecified personal reason. \\"He was incoherent,\\" Kwok said, adding that police believe he used a flammable liquid. Videos circulating on social media showed a chaotic scene of a fire inside the subway car and a man lying on the platform as people frantically used clothing to try to put out flames on his pants. In addition to the two in critical condition, six others were in serious condition, and 10 were stable, police said. The injured included seven males and 11 females, but the information provided by the government did not indicate whether it included the suspect. Hundreds of police and firefighters responded at 7:14 p.m. to the fire, which shut down the busy Tsim Sha Tsui station in downtown Kowloon. Such incidents are rare in Hong Kong, a wealthy Asian financial center that has a reputation for being safe and has relatively little violent crime. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A man has been arrested for arson after setting off a firebomb on a Hong Kong subway train during rush hour on 10 February, injuring 18 people.

Stationed in the Hawaiian Islands, he has a contentious but friendly relationship with his sergeant, Scrapper Thornhill. When General Fitts visits the post with his daughter Kit on their way to Manila, Dick is assigned to drive her to a reception that evening. Falling victim to the moonlit night, Kit and Dick attend a luau instead. They are discovered in each other's arms by Scrapper and Lieutenant Biddle, who is also in love with Kit. Biddle accuses Dick of ruining Kit's reputation and forcing her to accompany him off post. Dick decides to desert. Scrapper begs Kit to straighten things out with Biddle. To prevent Dick from deserting, Kit tells him that she was responding to a crazy impulse and he means nothing to her. Stung by her words, and Biddle's condescending statement that \\"if you were an officer and a gentleman, you'd understand,\\" Dick decides to compete with Biddle as an equal and applies for West Point. He is accepted and does very well, to Scrapper's delight. In his First Class year, Dick becomes First Captain and General Fitts is appointed Academy superintendent, with Biddle present as his aide. While most of his classmates are infatuated with Kit, Dick is cold to her. Consequently, he is not very happy when the rest of the men insist that she participate in the traditional \\"Hundredth Night\\" theatrical performance that he is to direct. Answer:","completion":"The last names of the two men in love with Kit are Dorcy Jr. (Richard Palmer Grant Dorcy Jr., also known as \\"Dick\\") and Biddle (Lieutenant Biddle)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A year after Sandy, mold a lingering problem for buildings, health Ramin Talaie / Getty Images A year later, a house damaged by Superstorm Sandy stands protected by a fence in the Belle Harbor section in the Queens borough of New York City. Hundreds of buildings are still affected, and some people are dealing with health problems because of mold. One year after Superstorm Sandy, the smell hasn't gone away. Hundreds — possibly thousands — of structures sit in limbo, musty with the stench of mold growing behind padlocked doors. \\"People are still in limbo,\\" said Tom Peter, the owner of Insurance Restoration Specialists in New Jersey. \\"There are a lot of houses that haven't been touched.\\" In New York City alone, 433 buildings remain red-tagged as unsafe to enter a year after Sandy blew ashore on Oct. 29, 2012, while 1,013 others are yellow-tagged with some restrictions, according to the Buildings Department. Jeffrey Gross, vice president of operations at Maxons Restorations in New York, said the numbers may be even higher because some people continue to live in their homes if the mold is growing out of sight, such as in basements or behind walls. And that mold can contribute to health problems. He estimated there are a couple of hundred New York City apartment buildings in need of cleanup, and 2,000 to 3,000 single-family homes with mold and other hurricane contamination problems. \\"Staten Island and Rockaway are probably some of the areas that are furthest behind on the road to recovery,\\" Gross said. Red tags indicate the building is unsafe. Property is seriously damaged and is unsafe to enter or occupy. Structures that have been demolished are no longer considered red.Yellow tags indicate restrictions. The property is damaged; entry limitations are specified on each posting. Probably hundreds of homeowners are in the same situation in New Jersey, Peter estimated, based on the work he's seen in the field. \\"They're waiting for permits. They're waiting for money. They're waiting for decisions — from agencies, or family members,\\" he said. People without insurance may be facing bills from 5,000 to 30,000 for a big mold removal, which involves scrubbing the mold clean at the source and then letting it completely dry with a powerful HEPA vacuum. The big problem, many of the experts said, is that a lot of people cleaned even behind the walls but failed to let it completely dry. The mold returned. \\"People started smelling things last summer,\\" Peter said. \\"The biggest surprise was when I opened up some walls six months after the storm and found some walls still wet,\\" Peter said. 'There's usually a lot more in the walls' In New York City, 1,684 single-family homes have received free post-Sandy mold removal through a public-private program administered by the Local Initiatives Support Corp. In all, 776 properties in Queens, 622 in Brooklyn, 283 in Staten Island and three in the Bronx have been remediated. Manhattan hasn't had any qualifying properties since there aren't many single-family homes in qualifying income ranges in its flood areas, said Nick Charles, director of communications for LISC New York. And although the number of people seeking mold remediation is winding down, it's possible there will be another surge once homeowners in insurance limbo finally get the OK to rebuild. \\"Once the contractor shows up and sees mold, (the homeowner) will have to come back to us,\\" because no contractor will want to work where mold is in the air, Charles said. Mold doesn't go away on its own. \\"Whatever you see on the outside, there's usually a lot more in the walls,\\" said Patricia Harman, director of standards and communications for the Restoration Industry Association trade group. \\"Because there was so much damage, and people were not allowed to get into their residence or business for so long, there was a lot of damage.\\" She agreed that drying out a building as quickly as possible is key, and it was a big lesson learned after Katrina. Katrina, for all its devastation, ensured that things weren't worse during Sandy, she said. \\"There were a lot of lessons that the rest of the industry learned, FEMA learned, local government learned, in terms of mobilizing, getting supplies in advance, gas and electric in there, getting things up and running as quick as possible.\\" The mold can pose a health threat as well. \\"There are still people out there a year out that are suffering from the health effects of Sandy,\\" said Dr. Neil Schachter, medical director of the respiratory care department at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. While the mold and the stress of the disaster can create new health problems for some people, it can also make other conditions worse in people already dealing with issues ranging from asthma and allergies to rheumatic and immune diseases, he said. \\"The people I've seen, it's been pretty striking,\\" Schachter said, noting he's seen dozens of patients with Sandy-related problems. Researchers including Bill Sothern, a doctoral candidate at the CUNY School of Public Health, have begun looking at ways to quantify a hurricane's health impacts. \\"We wish we knew just how big an impact this is having. We have anecdotal complaints: 'We cleaned our house, but we're having respiratory problems,'\\" said Sothern, who also is a certified industrial hygienist and founder of the East Harlem-based mold removal firm Microecologies. \\"I don't think anyone knows the health status. What we do know [is] there are substantial remaining environmental conditions, namely mold, that give us serious cause for concern,\\" he said. The one bit of good news is that neighbors probably don't need to worry about their own health if there is a mold problem next door, Sothern said. \\"We haven't seen any evidence that it's anything more than a nuisance,\\" he said. — By CNBC's Amy Langfield.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: First let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie but I got to say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty lackluster. Brosnan melts into this character so well, that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond. It also shows his range and depth as an actor. It is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year. I found the characters to be well crafted. The twist in the middle I felt was especially good. I also liked how the characters come off realistically. So many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking-stereotypes... I like the different approaches this movie takes. I think of sideways when I think of this movie but I think this is more watchable and a better movie overall... pick from the following. (1). negative.

In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's break down the above statement into its key components: 1. General orientation: This refers to the overarching direction and guiding principles that define the general framework for decision-making, resource allocation, and activities to be carried out within a specific organization, in this case, the ministry. To provide this general orientation, it is important to have a clear understanding of the mission, vision, goals, and values of the ministry, as well as the broader context in which it operates, such as political, social, economic, or technological factors. This will help to identify priority areas and formulate long-term strategies to achieve the desired outcomes. 2. Strategic priorities: These are the key objectives and goals that the ministry has identified as central to its mandate and that will drive its activities, policies, and programs. Strategic priorities should be aligned with the general orientation and informed by a thorough analysis of the and opportunities within the ministry's area of responsibility. Examples of strategic priorities could include improving access to public services, promoting innovation in a specific sector, or achieving measurable improvements in key performance indicators. 3. Administrative priorities: In addition to strategic priorities, the ministry should also define its administrative priorities, which are the internal processes, structures, and systems that need to be in place to effectively deliver on its mandate and support the achievement of its strategic priorities. Administrative priorities might involve optimizing resource allocation, enhancing transparency and accountability, or modernizing management practices. Ensuring that these internal elements are aligned with the strategic priorities will contribute to the overall effectiveness and performance of the ministry. 4. Specific orientation: While the general orientation provides a broad direction for the ministry, the specific orientation focuses on the key priorities that have been identified as particularly important, or that are expected to have a significant impact on the ministry's overall success. This may involve a more in-depth examination of one or more strategic priorities, or the identification of important initiatives, projects, or collaborations that will contribute to the achievement of the strategic priorities. Providing specific orientation involves clearly defining the desired outcomes, specifying the necessary actions and resources, and establishing mechanisms for monitoring progress and evaluating results. In conclusion, providing a general and specific orientation for the ministry is crucial for guiding its strategic direction, aligning priorities, and ensuring effective governance and management. By establishing a clear framework and setting out key priorities, the ministry will be better positioned to deliver on its mandate, address challenges, and seize opportunities, ultimately contributing to its overall success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vest Recklinghausen was first mentioned in 1228 as a fiefdom of the Archbishopric of Cologne and thus it belonged to the Electoral Rhenish Circle. The administrator lived in castle Westerholt, located in Herten. From 1446 to 1576 it was used as collateral, first pawned to the lords of Gemen and after 1492 to the Lords of Schauenburg and Holstein-Pinneberg, who pawned the territory back to the Archbishops of Cologne in 1576. During the Cologne War , Vest Recklinghausen was occupied and sacked several times by troops from both sides of the conflict. In 1583, although much of the territory was already Protestant, the Calvinist Elector of Cologne, Gebhard, Truchsess von Waldburg and his wife, Agnes, ordered the destruction of the icons and decorative elements of the churches. In 1584, the territory was sacked again, this time by the competing archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria. In 1586, the territory was invaded by Martin Schenck and Hermann Cloedt, who caused great damage to the farms and small villages, and were besieged by Claude de Berlaymont, also known as Haultpenne, in the city of Werl.

Within the Soviet Union, the RSFSR bordered the Ukrainian, Belarusian, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian SSRs to its west and Azerbaijan, Georgian and Kazakh SSRs to the south. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Which countries did the RSFSR conquer on the northwest?","completion":"To answer this question, I will first list the countries mentioned in the given text that are located to the northwest of the RSFSR and then determine if the RSFSR conquered these countries or not. Step 1: Identify countries to the northwest of the RSFSR The text states that Norway and Finland are on the northwest of RSFSR. Step 2: Research historical context of RSFSR's relationship with these countries It is important to understand the historical context of RSFSR's relationship with these countries. RSFSR, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, was one of the republics in the former Soviet Union. Step 3: Analyze if the RSFSR conquered Norway or Finland The RSFSR never conquered Norway. However, in the case of Finland, it is more complex. After the Russian Revolution in 1917 (which led to the formation of the RSFSR), Finland declared independence from Russia and fought two significant conflicts: the Finnish Civil War (1918) and the Winter War (1939-1940) against the Soviet Union. Although Finland was not officially conquered, it lost territories to the Soviet Union as a result of the Winter War and Moscow Peace Treaty signed in 1940. Conclusion: The RSFSR did not conquer any country on the northwest, but it did acquire some territories from Finland as a result of the Winter War and the Moscow Peace Treaty signed in 1940."},{"prompt":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

If \\"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan, she could see the landing strip.\\", can we conclude that \\"Susan could see the landing strip.\\"","completion":"Based on the sentence, \\"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan, she could see the landing strip,\\" we cannot definitively conclude that \\"Susan could see the landing strip.\\" The sentence as it's written contains potential ambiguity regarding the referent of the pronoun \\"she.\\" Let's analyze the sentence more thoroughly to better understand the possible interpretations. 1. Interpretation One: Susan can see the landing strip. In the first interpretation, \\"she\\" refers to Susan. Under this interpretation, the sentence suggests that as Andrea, who is inside the crop duster, flew over Susan, Susan gained a good enough vantage point to see the landing strip. However, this interpretation may seem a bit unusual, because it is not immediately clear how Andrea flying over Susan could directly impact Susan's ability to see the landing strip. 2. Interpretation Two: Andrea can see the landing strip. In the second interpretation, \\"she\\" refers to Andrea. In this case, the sentence describes Andrea's perspective as she flies over Susan in the crop duster. While passing over Susan's location, Andrea has a clear view of the landing strip. This interpretation seems more plausible because it is reasonable to assume that being at a higher vantage point, Andrea would have an improved line of sight to the landing strip. It's essential to recognize that the sentence itself does not make it clear which individual \\"she\\" refers to. Thus, without additional context or information, we cannot definitively conclude that either Andrea or Susan can see the landing strip. In summary, the sentence \\"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan, she could see the landing strip\\" is ambiguous in its current form. While it is possible that \\"Susan could see the landing strip,\\" it is not a definitive conclusion based on the information given. We would need more context to clarify the ambiguity and determine the correct interpretation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Somebody's got to help them,'\\" she says. She knew firsthand what they were going through. Six months earlier, a tornado had struck her town, taking the lives of her 2-year-old son, C.J. and her mother-in-law. \\"It was the most terrible experience of my life,\\" she says. \\"That _ will never go away, and it broke my heart to think about what these families were going through in Otwell.\\" So Kathryn loaded her car with juice boxes, snacks and toys and drove to Otwell. She gave the items to the Red Cross, and as she was leaving, she saw a couple sorting through the ruins of their home while their children were watching. So Kathryn stopped and gave a few toys to the kids and played with them for a while. \\"The parents couldn't thank me enough for what I did for their children,\\" she says. On the drive back to Evansville, Kathryn came up with an idea to help more kids. She talked her family, friends and neighbors into joining her and spent the next few months organizing fundraisers. Finally, in August 2007, she showed C.J.'s Bus, a 35-foot school bus that was turned into a mobile playroom. In the following years, stocked with video games and DVDs, toys, crafts, books and more, the bus traveled to disaster-torn towns, giving the children there a safe place to play. So far, C.J.'s bus has traveled to three states affected by tornadoes or floods, cheering up more than 756 children, aged 3-13.

Shred cheese for pizza","completion":"To shred cheese for pizza, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Choose the right cheese Select a cheese suitable for pizza, such as mozzarella, cheddar, or provolone. These cheeses melt well and provide a great texture and flavor. Make sure to purchase a block of cheese, as pre-shredded cheese can contain additives to prevent clumping. Additionally, freshly grated cheese tends to melt better. Step 2: Refrigerate the cheese (optional) Optionally, you can refrigerate the cheese for 30 minutes to an hour to make it firmer and easier to shred. This step is especially helpful if you are using softer cheeses like mozzarella. Step 3: Clean and prepare the grater Clean a box grater or flat grater with soap and water, ensuring that there are no lingering particles from previous use. Dry the grater thoroughly, as moisture can cause the cheese to stick to the grater. Step 4: Prepare your workspace Clear a clean, dry counter space to work on and lay out a cutting board or large plate to catch the shredded cheese. You may want to place a piece of wax or parchment paper on the cutting board or plate to help with easy clean-up. Step 5: Cut the cheese block Using a sharp knife, remove any rind or inedible outer layers from the cheese block. Then, cut the block into smaller, manageable pieces that can be easily held while grating. Step 6: Grate the cheese Hold the cheese firmly with one hand, and the grater with the other hand. Grate the cheese using the side of the grater with holes of your desired size, moving the cheese up and down against the grater. Apply pressure as needed, being careful to avoid grating your fingers. Rotate the block of cheese to avoid creating thin edges where it might slip and increase the risk of injury. Step 7: Measure the shredded cheese (optional) If the pizza recipe calls for a specific amount of shredded cheese, use a measuring cup or kitchen scale to determine the appropriate amount. This ensures that you have the right amount of cheese coverage on the pizza for an optimal end result. Step 8: Store or use the shredded cheese Once the cheese is shredded, it's ready to be used on your pizza. If you're not using the cheese immediately, store it in an airtight container or plastic bag in the refrigerator to keep it fresh. By following these steps, you will have successfully shredded cheese for your pizza, enhancing its flavor and texture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the effect?","completion":"The effect of the police aiming their weapons at the fugitive is multi-dimensional, resulting in a range of psychological, emotional, and physical outcomes – from the individuals directly involved in the scenario to the wider community and even society at large. To properly analyze this situation, we must examine the consequences experienced by the fugitive, the law enforcement officers, any bystanders, as well as the possible impact on the broader social context. 1. Fugitive: - Fear: The fugitive would likely experience a heightened sense of fear for their life. The mere presence of armed police officers conveys the severity of the situation and the imminent possibility of danger. - Compliance: The sight of weapons being aimed at the fugitive may force them to surrender, increasing their likelihood of obeying the police commands and reducing the chances of further resistance or escape. - Fight or Flight Response: A potential reaction to the immediate threat is the activation of the fugitive's fight-or-flight response, which can lead to unpredictable behavior, ranging from physical aggression to attempting to flee. - Stress and Anxiety: The overwhelming anxiety and stress, caused due to this life-threatening event, could have long-term effects on the fugitive's mental health, including PTSD or other trauma-related disorders. 2. Law Enforcement Officers: - Adrenaline: The tense situation would likely cause the release of adrenaline in the officers, potentially improving their focus and reactivity but also increasing the possibility of stress and anxiety. - Responsibility: The officers' decision to aim their weapons at the fugitive implies a readiness to use deadly force if necessary, adding a significant degree of responsibility and potentially impacting their emotional well-being. - Training and Protocol: The officers' adherence to their training and following established protocols during the situation can affect not only the immediate outcome but also their ability to cope with any aftermath, including any required legal proceedings or evaluations. 3. Bystanders and Members of the Community: - Immediate Safety Concerns: The presence of armed officers and a wanted fugitive can cause bystanders to feel unsafe or even at risk of being caught in the crossfire. This may result in them seeking cover or evacuating the area quickly. - Trust in Law Enforcement: The manner in which officers handle the situation can affect public perception of law enforcement's ability to protect and serve the community. Successful resolution without any harm to either the fugitive or others will improve trust, while any unfortunate outcome could lead to fear, mistrust, or legal ramifications. 4. Broader Social Context: - Media Coverage: The incident may receive extensive media coverage, affecting the public's perception of law enforcement efficiency and the fugitive's actions. The media portrayal of the situation can significantly influence opinions on policing practices, policies on use of force, and the overall safety of the community. - Legal Implications: The police's decision to aim their weapons at the fugitive might raise concerns over the use of excessive force, which could lead to debates about the necessity of lethal force in certain circumstances, as well as potential lawsuits and calls for reform in police training and protocols. - Societal Safety: The resolution of the incident has a considerable impact on societal safety, as a peaceful outcome would contribute to a sense of security and order, while a more violent ending could incite fear and apprehension among the public. In summary, the effect of police aiming their weapons at a fugitive is complex and far-reaching, encompassing psychological, emotional, and physical consequences for all parties involved. The handling of such situations and their outcomes can influence public perception of law enforcement, the legal system, as well as broader societal implications and discussions on safety and use of force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have often felt uneasy about you . I thought the Yankees would have hung you long before this for harboring Rebs they found at your house . I suppose they never heard about your going to Col . Martin 's to kill the Union soldier that was left by his company in their stable . What might the term rebs refer to in this story ?","completion":"In this context, the term \\"rebs\\" is most likely a colloquial abbreviation for \\"rebels,\\" which in the timeframe of this story is referring to the Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War (1861-1865). The war was fought between the Union (the Northern states) and the Confederacy (the Southern states) over various issues, including state rights, economic policies, and most notably, the abolition of slavery. During the Civil War, the Confederate soldiers were often called rebels because they were rebelling against the policies and government of the United States, hence the formation of the Confederacy. In the passage you supplied, the writer expresses concern over the possibility of their recipient being hung by the \\"Yankees,\\" which was a common term for Union soldiers, for harboring Confederate soldiers at their house. When the writer mentions \\"your going to Col. Martin's to kill the Union soldier that was left by his company in their stable,\\" it refers to an incident where the recipient might have actively supported the Confederate cause against the Union soldiers. The concern voiced in the text about potential consequences for the recipient's actions is a reflection of the tense and divided environment that existed during the American Civil War. In conclusion, the term \\"rebs\\" in this story refers to the Confederate soldiers, who were fighting against the Union during the American Civil War. The reference to \\"rebs\\" and \\"Yankees\\" highlights the division and animosity between the two opposing factions and the challenges faced by individuals living in that time period who may have found themselves in situations where they end up supporting one side over the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Whose album was called Hearts and Bones? , can you please find it? The concert took place on Saturday, September 19, 1981, on the Great Lawn, the central open space of Central Park. The first spectators, many carrying chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good spot. The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline. At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!\\" The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands, and began the concert with their 1968 hit \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". After the second song, \\"Homeward Bound\\", Simon delivered a short speech which began, \\"Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert.\\" He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch. The audience booed at the mention of Koch but applauded as Simon continued. Simon & Garfunkel played twenty-one songs in total: ten by the duo, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel, a cover of The Everly Brothers' \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\", and the medley version of \\"Maybellene\\". Each performer sang three songs alone, including one new song apiece. Garfunkel sang the Simon & Garfunkel classic \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"April Come She Will\\", and \\"A Heart in New York\\", a song written by Gallagher and Lyle that appeared on his album Scissors Cut, which had been released the previous month. Simon's solo performances were the title song of his 1975 album Still Crazy After All These Years, the number-one single \\"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\\", and the unreleased \\"The Late Great Johnny Ace\\", which would appear on his 1983 album Hearts and Bones.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3.

In February 1984, the group released their debut album The Smiths, which reached number two on the UK Albums Chart. Both \\"Reel Around the Fountain\\" and \\"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\\" met with controversy, with some tabloid newspapers alleging the songs were suggestive of paedophilia, a claim strongly denied by the group. In March 1984, they performed on Channel 4 music programme The Tube. The album was followed the same year by the non-album singles \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" and \\"William, It Was Really Nothing\\", which featured \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" on its B-side. Securing the band's first top ten placing, \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" was also significant for marking the beginning of engineer and producer Stephen Street's long-term working relationship with the band. More controversy followed when \\"Suffer Little Children\\", the B-side to \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\", touched on the theme of the Moors murders. This caused an uproar after the grandfather of one of the murdered children heard the song on a pub jukebox and felt the band was trying to commercialise the murders. After meeting with Morrissey, he accepted that the song was a sincere exploration of the impact of the murders. Morrissey subsequently established a friendship with Ann West, the mother of victim Lesley Ann Downey, who is mentioned by name in the song.

But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what are a source of food for many fish species?\\" is \\"bird species\\", given that keystone species are a source of food for many fish species? A:","completion":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what are a source of food for many fish species?\\" is not \\"bird species\\". Although some fish species might consume bird species occasionally or opportunistically, this is not the primary or most common food source for many fish species. Instead, a more appropriate answer would be \\"plankton, invertebrates, and other fish species.\\" Plankton, which includes both microscopic algae (phytoplankton) and tiny animals (zooplankton), are at the base of the aquatic food chain and provide sustenance for many smaller fish species. Invertebrates, such as insects, crustaceans (e.g., shrimp and crabs), and mollusks (e.g., snails and clams) are also essential food sources for a variety of fish species. Finally, larger, predatory fish species often feed on smaller fish species as part of their diets. Keystone species can indeed play a crucial role in the functioning of an ecosystem. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that they only serve as a food source for many fish species. Keystone species are organisms that have a disproportionately significant impact on their environment relative to their biomass. They can maintain the structure, function, and stability of their ecosystems through trophic interactions (predation, herbivory), habitat modification, and other indirect effects. It is important to differentiate between keystone species and the specific food sources that many fish species depend on for their survival."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: The 31 year-old was discovered relaxing in the sunshine next to a swimming pool on the Costa Blanca, more than four years after fleeing his armed robbery trial. Police said the “dangerous fugitive”, from Salford, Greater Manchester, “violently resisted” arrest during last week's armed raid in the resort in Calpe, near Alicante. Moran, the last remaining wanted criminal on a special hit list, was behind bars ahead of a court appearance tomorrow when authorities will seek to extradite him back to Britain. It emerged tonight that he was nearly captured in November but managed to evade arrest after an astonishing car chase, in which he drive the wrong way along a busy motorway. Moran fled Britain in February 2009 when he vaulted from the dock at Burnley Crown Court, assaulted four security officers and ran as a judge tried to remand him in custody over a £25,000 armed robbery of Royal Mail guards. Prosecutors said a hand gun, machete and baseball bat were used during the raid outside an Asda supermarket in Colne, Lancashire in 2005, in which the security guard was assaulted. The jury later returned a guilty verdict and he was convicted in his absence. Friday’s raid, in an area known as the “Costa del Crime” – considered a favoured hideout of British criminals – came after a major international operation headed by the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency [SOCA]. (Serious Organised Crime Agency/PA) Dramatic images released by authorities in Spain today showed masked officers crawling behind walls surrounding the villa before Moran was seen making trying to leap onto a tiled roof of a nearby outhouse after he spotted police. The heavily tattooed criminal was held to the ground and handcuffed in a pair of red shorts after his botched attempt to escape into thick bushes. His girlfriend, Genna Harvieu, sat in a chair by the pool, wrapped in a towel and surrounded by elite officers from Spain's Special Group of Operations. Police later found two firearms, 60 rounds of ammunition, a machete and several mobile phones in his property. It remains unclear what led to the raid. Tonight, Spain’s Interior Ministry disclosed that during his escape last year he smashed into two police cars in a 4x4 after being tracked down to the spa town of Los Alcazares in Murcia, southeast Spain. Moran, described by police as a “violent thug”, then drove up the wrong way of the busy AP7 motorway, which runs along the Mediterranean coast. During a search of the house he was living in at the time a handgun, ammunition, five kilos of cannabis and a vacuum packing machine were recovered. The previous year he was named by Crimestoppers on a list of wanted criminals as it marked the fifth anniversary of its Operation Captura campaign. Spanish police arrest a man, allegedly identified as British citizen Andrew Moran in Calpe, near Alicante (photo: AFP/Getty) His arrest, headed up by Soca's North-West Regional Organised Crime Unit, known as Titan, now means 50 fugitives have now been caught since the operation was launched. The arrest of his co-accused, Stephen Devalda, 29, at a hotel in Marbella, Spain, in 2011, left Moran the final man on a police hit-list of the Salford-based armed robbers. Devalda was extradited to Britain where he was jailed at Preston Crown Court for nine years and eight months for conspiracy to commit armed robbery and seven months for jumping bail. Matt Burton, Soca's Head of Investigations, said there was “no hiding place” for criminals. He said: \\"Moran thought he could evade capture fleeing to Spain, frequently changing his appearance and using false identities. “[We] have the capability to pursue criminals relentlessly, track them down, and put them behind bars.\\" Pictures released by Soca show how the criminal changed his appearance by growing a moustache and his hair, as well as wearing glasses. In one photograph Moran is posing with a rifle, while in another he is brandishing two automatic weapons. Det Ch Insp Janet Hudson, from Titan, added: “No matter how hard they try to evade justice they will not succeed.\\" Moran is due to appear in Spain’s Central Criminal Court, in Madrid, on tomorrow. ||||| One of Britain's most wanted fugitives is to be sent back to the UK after being arrested at a luxury villa on Spain's Costa Blanca. Andrew Moran, 31, from Salford, Greater Manchester, was arrested by police in the resort of Alicante, in Calpe, on Friday. At a court hearing in Madrid, he accepted a request for his extradition over an armed robbery in 2005. Moran was convicted in his absence after fleeing during his trial in 2009.

Write the answer: Photophobia is extreme sensitivity to, or fear of, what?","completion":"Photophobia is extreme sensitivity to, or fear of, light. This condition can manifest in individuals experiencing discomfort, pain, or an aversion to both natural and artificial light sources, including sunlight, fluorescent light, incandescent light, and even the light emitted by electronic devices such as computer screens, televisions, and smartphones. Photophobia is not a phobia in the traditional sense, as it is not necessarily an irrational fear. Instead, it is a heightened sensitivity to light that can cause physical discomfort or pain when an individual is exposed to it. This sensitivity can be temporary, as is sometimes experienced during a migraine or following eye surgery, or it can be a chronic condition. There are several potential causes of photophobia, including: 1. Genetic factors: Some individuals may have an inherited predisposition to photophobia, often linked to conditions like albinism and aniridia, where the eyes do not have enough pigmentation or the iris is underdeveloped, leading to increased light sensitivity. 2. Neurological disorders: Conditions like migraines, traumatic brain injury, and meningitis can lead to increased light sensitivity. Photophobia is a common symptom of migraines, where even normal levels of light can exacerbate headache pain. 3. Eye conditions: Certain eye conditions such as dry eye syndrome, corneal abrasion, uveitis, and keratitis can lead to photophobia. These conditions can cause the eye to become more sensitive to light due to inflammation, damage, or lack of moisture. 4. Medication side effects: Photophobia can be a side effect of certain medications such as antibiotics, antihistamines, and some antidepressants. These medications can cause light sensitivity by influencing neurological pathways or affecting eye functions. 5. Medical conditions: Other health issues like viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and vitamin deficiencies can contribute to photophobia. For example, Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that affects moisture-producing glands in the eyes, can lead to light sensitivity. To manage photophobia, individuals can take a variety of measures: 1. Wearing sunglasses: Using sunglasses with polarized lenses or UV protection can help block out bright light and reduce discomfort in outdoor environments. 2. Adjusting indoor lighting: Dimming or using warm-toned lighting inside can help minimize the impact of indoor light sources on individuals with photophobia. 3. Taking breaks from screens: Reducing exposure to electronic devices and taking regular breaks can help alleviate the strain on the eyes in those sensitive to screen light. 4. Seeking medical advice: Consulting an eye doctor or general practitioner can help identify the underlying cause of photophobia and develop an effective treatment plan. 5. Applying artificial tears: For those experiencing photophobia due to dry eye syndrome, using lubricating eye drops can help alleviate symptoms and reduce light sensitivity. In conclusion, photophobia is extreme sensitivity to, or fear of, light that can occur due to various factors such as genetic predisposition, neurological disorders, eye conditions, medication side effects, or other medical conditions. Managing photophobia involves taking protective measures, addressing underlying causes, and seeking appropriate medical advice to develop a personalized treatment plan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. By James Rush Marvel Comics has announced the new Captain America will be African-American for the first time in the comic franchise's history. Sam Wilson, also known as The Falcon, a crime-fighting partner of the original 'Cap' Steve Rogers, will be taking over the reins in the 'All-New Captain America' which is due to be released in November. Wilson is stepping in for Rogers after the original superhero lost his special powers and youth last month. The news comes in the same week comic book fans were rocked by an unexpected move by Marvel, when it revealed that Thor is now a woman. 'This new Thor isn't a temporary female substitute - she's now the one and only","completion":"Thor, and she is worthy!' said Marvel editor Wil Moss in a statement. The moves are part of Marvel's ongoing efforts to diversify its characters and appeal to a broader audience. The new Captain America series, written by Rick Remender and illustrated by Stuart Immonen, is expected to explore themes of racial identity, social justice, and patriotism from the perspective of an African-American superhero. In response to the news, reactions have been mainly positive, with fans and critics alike praising Marvel for aiming to be more inclusive and representative of its audience. However, some conservative fans took to social media to voice their displeasure, arguing that the changes were pandering to political correctness. Marvel's decision to make these alterations to their classic characters suggests a stronger commitment to inclusivity and diversity, hoping to reach a broader demographic. This shift can also be seen in several comic book series such as Ms. Marvel, which features a Muslim teenage girl as its protagonist, and Iron Man, where Riri Williams, a young African-American woman, dons the armor as Ironheart after Tony Stark's apparent death. With the change in Captain America's mantle, it is expected that more stories dealing with contemporary political and racial issues affecting the nation will be included in the comic series. This might involve showcasing minorities working together to overcome adversity, exploring societal privileges, and uncovering systemic biases in policing and law-making. As the 'All-New Captain America' hits the comic stands, it is expected that Marvel will collaborate with schools, libraries, and community centers to organize panel discussions and events celebrating these new characters and the impact they have on promoting diversity, awareness, and social change. Such initiatives are aimed at sparking open conversations among young people to better understand the importance of representation and fostering empathy towards those who are different from themselves. Meanwhile, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has also showcased diversity in its recent films and TV series. On the big screen, Black Panther, Marvel's first film centering on a Black superhero, shattered box office records and garnered critical acclaim. Additionally, the Disney+ streaming platform has released shows like 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,' which tackles racial issues, and the upcoming 'Hawkeye' series, featuring a deaf superheroine. As the public expresses increased interest in diverse superheroes, Marvel is likely to adapt the new Captain America and Thor characters into their successful film and television projects. In conclusion, Marvel Comics' decisions to introduce an African-American Captain America and a female Thor emphasize an inclusive and progressive approach to storytelling. By putting the spotlight on underrepresented groups in their comic series and adaptations, Marvel is actively working towards challenging stereotypes, promoting diversity, and encouraging critical discussions on relevant societal issues. Great things are expected from the 'All-New Captain America' comic, and comic book fans around the world eagerly anticipate the impact that these changes will bring to both the Marvel Universe and the real world."},{"prompt":"I heard that carson was ash's best friend so he agreed to take her.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Why do marriage of mixed jewish backgrounds occur more often?\\" is in \\"In Israel, the term Ashkenazi is now used in a manner unrelated to its original meaning, often applied to all Jews who settled in Europe and sometimes including those whose ethnic background is actually Sephardic. Jews of any non-Ashkenazi background, including Mizrahi, Yemenite, Kurdish and others who have no connection with the Iberian Peninsula, have similarly come to be lumped together as Sephardic. Jews of mixed background are increasingly common, partly because of intermarriage between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi, and partly because many do not see such historic markers as relevant to their life experiences as Jews.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Why do marriage of mixed Jewish backgrounds occur more often?\\" lies in the changing definitions and perceptions of Jewish ethnic backgrounds, along with increasing instances of intermarriage between different Jewish groups. In Israel, the original meanings of the terms Ashkenazi and Sephardic have shifted, resulting in broader, more inclusive categories. Ashkenazi, initially referring to Jews originating from Europe, is now often applied to all European Jews and sometimes even includes those with Sephardic backgrounds. Similarly, the term Sephardic has expanded to encompass not only those with connections to the Iberian Peninsula but also Mizrahi, Yemenite, Kurdish, and other non-Ashkenazi backgrounds. There are two main factors contributing to the increased occurrence of marriages between mixed Jewish backgrounds. First, intermarriage between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews is on the rise, leading to the blending of backgrounds and traditions. Second, many individuals no longer view these historic ethnic markers as relevant to their contemporary Jewish identity and experiences. As a result, they are more likely to marry someone from a different Jewish background due to shared beliefs, values, and cultural practices, rather than focusing solely on their ancestral origins. In summary, mixed Jewish background marriages occur more frequently due to evolving definitions of Jewish ethnic backgrounds, a growing inclination toward intermarriage, and a shift in focus from historical ancestry to shared life experiences and cultural connections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Victoria Woollaston. PUBLISHED:. 10:01 EST, 26 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:39 EST, 26 June 2013. The Moon could soon become a robot colony of mechanical apes exploring the lunar landscape, thanks to a monkey robot designed in Germany. Engineers from the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) and the University of Bremen have developed a space robot designed to walk and climb like an ape over rocky ground, such as the terrain of the Moon. The iStruct Demonstrator has mechanical arms, legs and a spine that mimic the way primates behave - and could replace the wheeled rovers currently used in lunar missions. Scroll down for video. Engineers from the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence have developed a robot that walks and climbs like a monkey. The researchers plan to send the mechanical chimp to the moon to explore the lunar landscape because it is more agile and versatile than current wheeled rovers and explorers. The iStruct Demonstrator, pictured, weighs 18 kg. It has an articulated spinal column connecting the torso and pelvis to foot and ankle structures. These 'joints' are each fitted with sensors which react and respond to the ground below. The iStruct demonstrator has:. 43 individual force-sensing resistor (FSR) sensors. Six additional FSR sensors on exposed parts used for collision detection. A 6-axis Force/Torque-sensor. A distance sensor in heel to anticipate heel strike. A digital 3-axis accelerometer to perceive the orientation of the foot. Two temperature sensors to compensate for temperature changes in the electronics. Digital magnetic angular encoders to monitor every moving axes of the foot and ankle structure. The engineering team have already built the robo-ape and have now begun testing it in the centre's mock lunar landscape. According to researchers at the DFKI, a primate's body is better suited to the lunar terrain because its four-legged stance is stable when climbing over obstacles or hills. The robot can also right itself if it falls over. It can additionally stand on its hind legs and use its arms to pick up samples and move obstacles using its robotic hands. The iStruct Demonstrator weighs 18kg and measures 66x43x75 cm. It has an articulated spinal column connecting the torso and. pelvis to foot and ankle structures. These 'joints' are each fitted with sensors that react and respond to the ground below. It also has 26 degrees of freedom thanks to various electric motors. The iStruct Demonstrator is similar to the CHIMP robot developed for the DARPA Robotics Challenge. The iStruct Demonstrator's 'legs' and 'joints' have been engineered to mimic those of a primate. This makes the robot more capable of climbing, walking and collecting samples from the rocky Moon terrain. However, the. iStruct's articulated spine, which works as a 6-axes force-torque. sensor, is unique to this robot and. helps it move on all fours. The sensors in the foot and ankle also allow. it to maintain its balance on sloped terrain. A study from the research centre said: 'The aim of the iStruct project is the development of a robotic system which effectively improves the locomotion and mobility characteristics, if applied to the robotic system. 'The main focus in this project is the development of intelligent structures for application in mobile robots to increase the efficiency of a complex walking machine by the purposeful use of intelligent structures. 'A high number of sensors is needed to allow a precise perception of the environment; hence there will be large data sets which have to be locally pre-processed and evaluated. 'In order to meet the high requirements of the intelligent structures, sensors and actuators have to be selected or developed with regard to both their functionality and their integration capability within the intelligent structures.' In 2009, project leader Daniel Kühn worked on a similar robot called the Little Ape capable of simple quadrupedal walking. His current project is due to be completed by August.

What is the name of the person that said \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\".","completion":"The name of the person who said, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then.

It is the official language of the country and is also spoken by Czech communities in other countries around the world. The Czech language is closely related to the Slovak language, with which it shares a high degree of mutual intelligibility. The Czech language has a rich history dating back to the 9th century. It evolved from the Old Slavonic, which was used by the Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe. Through the centuries, Czech has undergone various linguistic changes and has been influenced by Latin and German. The modern Czech language was standardized in the 19th century, during the Czech National Revival movement. Czech uses a Latin-based alphabet with diacritical marks, which include háček (caron) and kroužek (ring), to modify specific characters. This alphabet consists of 42 letters, which allows for the accurate representation of Czech sounds. The grammar of Czech is complex, featuring a high degree of inflection for nouns, adjectives, verbs, and pronouns. The language has seven grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. Moreover, Czech has a flexible word order, which provides more freedom for speakers to emphasize different parts of a sentence. Czech vocabulary is rich and diverse, containing many loanwords from Latin, German, French, and more recently, English. The language also has a plethora of idioms, proverbs, and sayings, creating a vibrant and expressive means of communication. Czech literature plays an essential role in promoting the language's rich cultural heritage. Renowned Czech authors, such as Franz Kafka, Jaroslav Hašek, Karel Čapek, and Milan Kundera, introduced the world to Czech literature and culture through their works. Learning Czech can be challenging due to its complex grammatical structure, but it is a valuable skill for those who wish to engage with the culture and people of the Czech Republic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They say the problem is growing. \\"Teenagers really don't pay attention to how much noise they are exposed to ,\\" Josef Shargorodsky of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston told Reuters. \\"Often people won't notice it, but even very little hearing loss may influence language development,\\" said Shargorodsky, one of the researchers. The study compared surveys from the early 1990s and the mid-2000s. Each included a few thousand teenagers. In the first survey, about 15 percent of teenagers had some degree of hearing loss. Some 15 years later, that number had risen by a third, to nearly 20 percent. \\"This certainly is big news,\\" said Alison Grimes, an ear doctor. \\"Hearing loss is very common in old people,\\" Grimes said, but she added that it was worrying to see it happen in the younger age group. In babies and young children, hearing problems are known to slow language development. The science is less clear for teenagers, but it is easy to imagine how being hard of hearing could influence learning, said Grimes. The reasons for the rise are still unclear. When researchers asked teenagers about noise exposure - on the job, at school or from activities, for example - the teenagers didn't report any change.

Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.

President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Question: Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"Trump wants North Korea to denuclearize to ensure regional and global security by preventing the use of nuclear weapons and to reduce the potential risk of nuclear proliferation. This would also help in building a more stable and peaceful relationship between North Korea, the U.S., and other nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Limpiar y preparar las superficies: Antes de aplicar la masilla, es fundamental asegurarse de que las superficies donde se colocará estén limpias y libres de restos de polvo, suciedad o cualquier otro elemento que pueda interferir con la adhesión de la masilla. 2. Medir y cortar la masilla en tiras de ancho idéntico: Utilice una herramienta de medición, como un calibrador o una regla, para determinar y marcar el ancho que deben tener las tiras de masilla. A continuación, corte las tiras de masilla según estas marcas para garantizar que todas tengan el mismo ancho. 3. Aplicar la masilla de manera uniforme: Asegúrese de aplicar la tira de masilla en el pliegue de la cubierta de manera uniforme, presionando ligeramente para que se adhiera correctamente en todos los puntos. 4. Alisar y retirar el exceso de masilla: Utilice una espátula u otra herramienta adecuada para alisar la superficie de la masilla y retirar el exceso. Esto permite que las tiras de masilla se asienten de manera uniforme y proporcionen la protección necesaria en todos los puntos. 5. Dejar secar y verificar: Una vez aplicada la masilla, deje que se seque según las indicaciones del fabricante.

Hoping to break a two-game losing streak the Redskins played on home ground for an NFC duel with the Buccaneers. In the second quarter the Redskins took the lead as QB Donovan McNabb completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Logan Paulsen. The Buccaneers replied as kicker Connor Barth nailed a 25-yard field goal, but the Redskins scored again with kicker Graham Gano making a 25-yard field goal. They fell behind with Barth making a 44 and a 35-yard field goal, followed by QB Josh Freeman completing a 41-yard TD pass to TE Kellen Winslow (With a successful 2-point conversion as Freeman ran to the endzone). The Redskins tried to cut the lead with McNabb throwing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss, but the snap on the PAT fell through the hands of Hunter Smith in the final seconds, sealing the Redskins' fate in yet another backbreaking loss. With the loss, not only did the Redskins guarantee that they would finish with more road wins than home wins for the first time since the 1994 season, but more importantly, they fell to 5-8, and were officially eliminated from postseason contention, with the Eagles' 30-27 win over the Cowboys.

Inquiry will focus on lack of \\"red flags\\" after suspect's actions drew FBI attention. Article:","completion":"Title: FBI Policies and Practices Under Scrutiny Following Fort Hood Massacre; Former FBI and CIA Director William Webster to Lead Investigation The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is set to undergo a thorough review of its \\"policies, practices, and actions\\" before the tragic Fort Hood massacre, as announced by federal authorities. William Webster, a highly respected and experienced 85-year-old former director of both the FBI and CIA, has been commissioned to spearhead the investigation. The Fort Hood massacre, which occurred on November 5, 2009, resulted in the deaths of 13 individuals and left 32 others injured. The incident took place at the Fort Hood military base in Texas when a lone gunman, U.S. Army Major Nidal Hasan, began firing on a group of unarmed soldiers preparing for deployment. Hasan was later convicted and sentenced to death in 2013. This review aims to scrutinize the FBI and determine whether crucial \\"red flags\\" were missed during the period leading up to the attack. Despite prior actions of the suspect drawing the attention of the FBI, these possible warning signs were apparently not enough to prevent the tragedy. Webster's extensive and esteemed career make him aptly suited for the task of leading this investigation. In the past, he notably helmed a probe into the FBI's practices following the notorious spy case in 2001 involving Robert Hanssen. During this period, Webster's recommendations led to significant improvements in FBI security policies and counterintelligence capabilities. The inquiry into the Fort Hood massacre will primarily focus on the lack of \\"red flags\\" that could have potentially prevented the attack. Throughout the course of the investigation, the team will examine how the FBI handled information relating to Hasan, and whether any oversights in their decision-making process allowed the massacre to occur. In doing so, the objective is to identify areas where the FBI could enhance its current practices and prevent future incidents. This examination of the FBI's policies and procedures surrounding the Fort Hood massacre is of the utmost importance to national security. By identifying potential weaknesses in the system, authorities can ensure that the appropriate measures are taken to better protect the nation against possible acts of violence in the future. In conclusion, the upcoming investigation led by William Webster will scrutinize the FBI's \\"policies, practices, and actions\\" before the Fort Hood massacre, with the ultimate aim of improving current policies and preventing similar incidents from happening in the future. As the former director of the FBI and CIA, Webster brings significant expertise and experience to the task, ensuring a thorough review that will provide valuable insights into the organization's overall performance and efficiency."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Q: What science is the study of the shape and arrangement of cells in tissue?

Background: Antonio Ramiro Romo (born April 21, 1980) is an American football television analyst and former quarterback who played 14 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Eastern Illinois University, where he won the Walter Payton Award in 2002, and led the Panthers to an Ohio Valley Conference championship in 2001. He signed as an undrafted free agent with the Cowboys in 2003. Beginning his career as a holder, Romo became the Cowboys' starting quarterback during the 2006 season. Context: On September 7, 2008, Romo led the Cowboys to a 28-10 win over the Cleveland Browns in their season opener. Romo completed 24 of his 32 passes for a total of 320 yards and one touchdown. After the game, Romo required 13 stitches for a large gash on his chin that occurred during the third quarter when linebacker Willie McGinest hit him in the chin with his helmet. The NFL fined McGinest 7,500 for the hit. On September 15, Romo led the Dallas Cowboys to a 41-37 win against the Philadelphia Eagles in the second game of the 2008 season. Romo completed 21 of his 30 passes for a total of 312 yards and three touchdowns. The 54 combined points scored by the Cowboys and Eagles in the first half were the second most points scored in a half during a Monday Night Football game. Romo and the Cowboys won their third straight before losing to the Washington Redskins, falling to 3-1. Following a win against the Cincinnati Bengals, Romo was injured in a loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The Cowboys, under Brad Johnson, went 1-2 the next three games, falling to the St. Louis Rams, beating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and losing to the New York Giants. In what became a de facto third playoff game for Romo shortly prior to its start, on December 28, Romo and the Cowboys failed to compete against the Philadelphia Eagles in a 44-6 loss. Romo committed three turnovers in the game and went 21/39 for 183 yards and no touchdowns. The loss dropped Romo's combined record in December to 5-8 and again raised questions about his performance in games of consequence. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there are a few interesting aspects in this article. 1. Tony Romo, the person in the article, was not only a football player but is now a television analyst too. He used to play as a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. 2.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. friction is used for stopping a vehicle by brakes friction is used for stopping a vehicle by","completion":"brakes because it plays a significant role in ensuring the safety and proper functionality of the vehicle. Friction is a force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact with each other, and it is essential in many aspects of our daily lives. In the case of stopping a vehicle, the friction between the brake components and the wheel plays a crucial role in decelerating and ultimately halting the vehicle. Brake systems in vehicles come in different types, but the most common ones are the disc brake and the drum brake. Both systems use friction to stop the vehicle, but they achieve this goal through slightly different mechanisms. Let's examine both types in detail. Disc Brakes: Disc brakes are used in most modern vehicles. They consist of a brake rotor (a rotating disc), calipers, brake pads, and hydraulic or mechanical components that actuate the brake. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, the hydraulic or mechanical components are engaged, which causes the calipers to clamp the brake pads onto the brake rotor. As a result, friction is generated between the brake pads and the rotating disc, converting the kinetic energy of the moving vehicle into thermal energy (heat). This process decelerates the vehicle and ultimately brings it to a stop. The advantage of using disc brakes is that they dissipate heat more efficiently compared to drum brakes, allowing them to handle more braking force. This is especially useful in high-performance vehicles or those who are frequently used in hilly areas or in situations where rapid stopping is essential. Drum Brakes: Drum brakes are an older design and are commonly found in older vehicles or in modern vehicles as rear brakes. They consist of a brake drum, brake shoes, a wheel cylinder, and other connecting components. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, hydraulic pressure is transmitted through the brake lines, and the wheel cylinder expands. This expansion forces the brake shoes, which are lined with friction material, against the inside of the brake drum. The friction between the brake shoes and the brake drum opposes the rotational motion of the wheel, causing the vehicle to slow down and ultimately stop. While drum brakes are generally considered to be less effective than disc brakes, they are still commonly used on smaller or less powerful vehicles due to their simplicity and lower production cost. In conclusion, friction is used for stopping a vehicle by brakes through the interaction between the brake components and the wheel. This interaction generates resistance, which slows down and ultimately stops the vehicle. Friction is a key force that ensures braking systems in vehicles function safely and effectively, enabling drivers to control their vehicles in a variety of situations. Overall, a better understanding of friction in vehicle braking systems can aid in the development of improved and safer transportation technologies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before.

Step 1: Simplify the equation The equation given is: 27*h + 54 = -0*h Since -0*h is equal to 0, the equation becomes: 27*h + 54 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable h Now we must get h alone on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 54 from both sides of the equation: 27*h + 54 - 54 = 0 - 54 27*h = -54 Now, to completely isolate h, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 27: 27*h / 27 = -54 / 27 h = -2 So, the solution to the equation 27*h + 54 = -0*h is h = -2."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Fact 1: Percy Williams Bridgman was an American physicist who conducted extensive research on the physics of materials under high pressures. Fact 2: Ductility is a mechanical property of materials that refers to their ability to deform under tensile stress without fracturing. Now, combining these facts, we can infer that Percy Williams Bridgman experimented with how different factors affect the ductility of materials under high-pressure conditions. The two dependents of ductility that Bridgman would have experimented with can vary; however, common dependents of ductility include temperature and pressure.

If we are to live up to our educational profession, we must look our aim in the face and honestly practise what we believe. While training of character and conduct is the accepted aim for education in general, to make this useful and practical each teacher must fix her attention on how this ultimate aim affects her own special part of the whole work. By watching the free child she will discover how best she can help him: he knows his own business, and when unfettered by advice or command shows plainly that he is chiefly concerned with _gaining experience_.

Michael John Kells Fleetwood was born in Redruth, second child to John Joseph Kells Fleetwood and Bridget Maureen (nee Brereton) Fleetwood. His elder sister Susan Fleetwood, who died of cancer in 1995, became an actress. In early childhood Fleetwood and his family followed his father, a Royal Air Force fighter pilot, to Egypt. After about six years, they moved to Norway where his father was posted on a NATO deployment. In November 1977 Fleetwood and Nicks began having an affair. It would continue sporadically for the next two years during the fallout from the end of Fleetwood's relationship with Boyd, until the pair mutually decided to end the affair. \\"Never in a million years could you have told me that [her affair with Fleetwood] would happen,\\" Nicks later stated. \\"Everybody was angry, because Mick was married to a wonderful girl and had two wonderful children. I was horrified. I loved these people. I loved his family. So it couldn't possibly work out. And it didn't. I just couldn't.\\" Boyd and Fleetwood had in fact begun living together once more in 1976, and would remarry temporarily to assist their children with emigration to the United States. However they quickly divorced for the second time some months later. In November 1978 Fleetwood moved into a Bel Air home with Sara Recor, mutual friend of Fleetwood and Nicks who was at the time married to another music producer. Meanwhile, Fleetwood began working on a charity project to get Fleetwood Mac to tour the Soviet Union, however the Soviet War in Afghanistan later made the tour untenable. Tusk, Fleetwood Mac's 12th studio album, was released in 1979. The work represented a more experimental direction taken by Buckingham. Fleetwood, recently diagnosed as having diabetes after suffering recurring bouts of hypoglycemia during several live shows, was again instrumental in maintaining the band's cohesion. He placated Buckingham over feelings of creative claustrophobia and discomfort playing alongside Nicks. On the issue of Buckingham taking creative control away from the other members of the group for the creation of Tusk, Fleetwood recounts that his three-day discussion with Buckingham culminated in him telling the latter that \\"if it's good, then go ahead.\\" Though the nature of the album strained relationships again within the band - particularly John McVie, a long-established blues musician who disliked the experimental nature of the album - Fleetwood himself rates the album as his favourite by Fleetwood Mac, and cites the freedom of creative expression allotted to each band member as integral to the survival of the group. The album sold four million copies worldwide, a return noticeably poorer than Rumours. Though Buckingham was blamed by the record labels, Fleetwood linked the album's relative failure to the RKO radio chain playing the album in its entirety prior to release, thus allowing mass home taping. Later that year, Fleetwood Mac embarked on a lengthy tour that brought them across America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK. The tour lasted from October 1979 to September 1980, consisting of 113 concerts.

Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog. Laika, a 2007 graphic novel by Nick Abadzis giving a fictionalized account of Laika's life, won the Eisner Award for Best Publication for Teens. Laika is also mentioned in the 2004 song \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\" by Arcade Fire, included on their debut album Funeral.

Bars: Bars was a dog that died on 28 July 1960, when the R-7 rocket carrying him and another dog, Lisichka, exploded shortly after launch. 2. Lisichka: Along with Bars, Lisichka was also killed in the R-7 rocket explosion on 28 July 1960. 3. Pchyolka: Pchyolka was one of the two dogs that died on 1 December 1960, when the Korabl-Sputnik 3 spacecraft was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge. This action was taken to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after it took a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory. 4. Mushka: Mushka was the other dog that perished alongside Pchyolka on 1 December 1960, in the intentional destruction of the Korabl-Sputnik 3 spacecraft, for the same reasons mentioned above. These tragic incidents occurred as part of the Soviet Union's efforts to explore space using dogs as test subjects, before sending humans. In addition to Laika, these four dogs made significant contributions to the Soviet space program, ultimately paving the way for human space exploration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Information: - A short film is any film not long enough to be considered a feature film. Although no consensus exists as to where that boundary is drawn, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as \\"an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less, including all credits\\". The term featurette originally applied to a film longer than a short subject, but shorter than a standard feature film. - Crimes of the Future is a 1970 Canadian science fiction film written, shot, edited, and directed by David Cronenberg. - Science fiction film (or sci-fi) is a genre that uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, extrasensory perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel or other technologies. Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition. In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held. - Stereo is a 1969 Canadian film written , shot , edited and directed by David Cronenberg . It stars Ronald Mlodzik , who also appears in Cronenberg 's Crimes of the Future , Shivers and Rabid . It was Cronenberg 's first feature - length effort , following his two short films , Transfer and From the Drain . It is a brief feature film , with a running time of a little over one hour . This film is set in 1969 . The film has a 60 % ' fresh ' rating on Rotten Tomatoes . - David Paul Cronenberg, (born March 15, 1943) is a Canadian filmmaker, actor and author. Cronenberg is one of the principal originators of what is commonly known as the body horror or visceral horror genre. This style of filmmaking explores people's fears of bodily transformation and infection. In his films, the psychological is typically intertwined with the physical. - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - From the Drain is a 1967 short film directed by David Cronenberg while he was in film school. After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'stereo ' exhibits the relationship of 'genre'. Find the answer from the choices below.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What happens to imperfective verbs to create others? Context: The verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix—for example, the imperfective psát (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-. In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodávat. Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb jít (to go) has the iterative form chodit (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form chodívat (to go regularly). The answer is:","completion":"Imperfective verbs undergo further morphology to create other imperfective verbs, specifically iterative and frequentative forms, which denote repeated or regular action.

Adjectives Used: The choice of adjectives used by the reviewer allows us to see the positive nature of the review. Using words such as \\"best\\" and \\"delicious\\" to describe the bruschetta indicates that the reviewer had a very enjoyable experience with the dish. 2. Mention of Flavor Combinations: The reviewer emphasizes the enjoyable aspect of the dish by mentioning the \\"so many delicious flavor combinations.\\" This allows us to understand that the bruschetta has a diverse range of flavors and elements that work well together, contributing to the positive outlook on the dish. 3. Make a Meal of It: By suggesting that the bruschetta is good enough to \\"make a meal of it,\\" the reviewer is indicating that they believe the dish is not only delicious but also satisfying, as it could be turned into a full meal. This further emphasizes the reviewer's positive experience with the bruschetta and suggests that they believe it to be substantial and filling. 4. Highly Recommended: The most significant part of this review is the clear endorsement indicated by the phrase \\"highly recommended.\\" This clearly shows that the reviewer is not only pleased with their experience but also confident enough in the dish's quality to actively recommend it to others. In doing so, they express their support and satisfaction with the bruschetta. In conclusion, the given review is undeniably positive due to the use of enthusiastic language, emphasis on the dish's flavor combinations, the suggestion of turning it into a full meal, and the confident recommendation of the bruschetta to other potential consumers.

Question 1: \\"What is the meaning of 'vox organalis'?\\" Question 2: \\"What does 'beghairat' mean?\\" Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the two terms 'vox organalis' and 'beghairat' and identify their meanings. 'Vox organalis' is a Latin term, where 'vox' means voice and 'organalis' is related to organ or instrument. It is often used in the context of music, specifically in organum, a type of medieval polyphonic music, to refer to the secondary voice or added voice in a composition. 'Beghairat' is an Urdu term that means someone who lacks self-respect, honor, or shame. Step 2: Compare the meanings of the two terms. Now that we have the meanings of both terms, we can see that 'vox organalis' is related to music and the addition of a secondary voice in a composition, while 'beghairat' describes a person's lack of self-respect or shame. Step 3: Determine whether the two meanings are the same. By comparing the meanings, we can conclude that the answer to these two questions is not the same. 'Vox organalis' refers to a musical concept, whereas 'beghairat' is a term describing a personal trait."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If The office, in a former bodega, was Mazzariello's idea, and he got some help from high places early on., can we conclude that \\"The office has grown rapidly since its inception.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively determine that \\"The office has grown rapidly since its inception.\\" However, we can infer that Mazzariello's idea of transforming a former bodega into an office might have been successful, especially considering that he received some help from high places early on. To fully understand and support the conclusion that \\"The office has grown rapidly since its inception,\\" we would require more information and context, such as: 1. Timeframe: An essential factor in determining rapid growth is knowing the period in which the office has been operating. For example, if \\"since its inception\\" refers to a few months or years, different growth rates may be perceived as rapid. 2. Growth Metrics: Quantitative measures such as an increase in the number of employees, revenue, or market share would help to support the statement of rapid growth. Additionally, qualitative aspects such as improved customer satisfaction, brand reputation, and industry recognition could also point towards growth. 3. Industry Benchmarks: Comparing the office's growth to that of other similar businesses would help us understand how it has performed in the context of its industry. Rapid growth could be determined if the office's growth significantly outperforms the industry average. 4. Factors contributing to growth: Identifying the drivers that have led to the office's growth, such as successful marketing campaigns, strategic partnerships, or innovative product offerings, would strengthen the conclusion that the office has experienced rapid growth since its inception. 5. Plans for future expansion: If the office has shared any plans or aspirations for scaling up operations, opening new branches, or extending its market reach, this could also provide evidence in favor of rapid growth. In summary, without additional context and information about the office's performance, industry benchmarks, factors contributing to its growth, and plans for future expansion, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"The office has grown rapidly since its inception.\\" Nonetheless, it's reasonable to assume that Mazzariello's idea, along with the support he received from high places early on, has contributed to the success of the office."},{"prompt":"Q: Question: how many presidential terms did fdr serve?

They are known to be the life of the party and the ones who help to keep morale high in the camp with their quirky humour and outrageous stunts. In their downtime, they often indulge in outrageous bets and friendly competition with other members of the camp, much to the dismay of their no-nonsense commanding officer, Colonel Potter (Jeff Bridges). When a new, perfectionist surgeon, Major Charles Winchester III (Benedict Cumberbatch), arrives at the camp, he quickly earns the rivalry of Trapper and Hawkeye, as he steals the spotlight with his exceptional surgical skills. However, unbeknownst to everyone, Winchester loves to gamble on the side, and soon, Trapper and Hawkeye learn about his secret. Seeing an opportunity, they challenge Winchester to a high-stakes bet to prove who the best surgeon in the camp truly is. Winchester, always eager to show off his skills, agrees to the challenge. The wager is that each of the three surgeons must put up 50% of their earnings in the form of cash, and the surgeon who takes the least time to complete five successful complex surgeries will win the entire pot. The news of the bet swiftly spreads through the camp, energizing the soldiers and causing a series of side bets and rivalries to crop up. With both pride and money on the line, Trapper, Hawkeye, and Winchester gear up for the intense contest. As the challenge progresses, the trio encounters several complications, including unpredictable injuries they're unaccustomed to handling, obstacles caused by their pranks and distractions, and additional drama when they must tackle highly complicated surgeries. The competition heats up when each surgeon shows their professional determination and inventive surgical approaches, pushing the limits of what they've believed they can accomplish. When the final surgery arrives, an unexpected twist occurs, requiring all three surgeons to work together to save a soldier's life, which puts the completion of the bet on hold.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.

A study by Durham University suggests 89% of England's population live within a 20-minute walk of a pharmacy. In deprived areas, the proportion was nearly 100%. The researchers said with more support pharmacies could provide everything from blood-pressure checks and diabetes screening to lifestyle advice. Some pharmacies already do this, but researchers said it very much depended on whether local health bosses were willing to fund them. Lead author Dr Adam Todd said: \\"These results show that pharmacies are well-placed in the community to deliver public health services. \\"This is particularly important for the poorest areas where more people die from conditions such as smoking, alcohol misuse and obesity compared to people from more affluent areas. \\"With easy access without patients needing to make an appointment, the results suggest there is a potential for community pharmacies to deliver public health interventions to areas which need it most.\\" The paper - published in the BMJ Open journal - said pharmacies could play a particularly vital role because the often-quoted inverse care law did not seem to apply. That refers to the fact that the areas with the best health services tended to be the ones with the least health problems. But as the deprived areas had the better access to pharmacies, the reverse was true, the study, which used a postcode analysis, said.

How do North East Indians feel about it? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"I will answer these questions step by step: 1. What physical traits differentiate Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Singaporean, and North-east Indian people from one another? Step 1: Acknowledge the physical differences between different ethnicities. Step 2: List the differences: - Chinese: Generally, Chinese people have a range of facial features, such as a flat face, high-bridged nose, round face shape, and wider-set eyes. However, due to China's large population and ethnic diversity, this is not universally applicable. - Japanese: Japanese people tend to have longer, more oval-shaped faces, high-bridged noses, and more \\"hooded\\" or \\"double\\" eyelids. - Korean: Koreans often possess cheekbones that are more prominent and a slightly more square-shaped face compared to the Chinese and Japanese. The \\"V-shaped\\" jawline is a notable trait in a Korean face. - Singaporean: Singaporeans come from diverse ethnic backgrounds, such as Malay, Chinese, and Indian, making it difficult to identify specific Singaporean physical traits. Picking out a \\"typical Singaporean face\\" is thus harder due to the melting pot of ethnicities. - North-east Indian: North-east Indian people have diverse facial features due to their tribal backgrounds. However, some common characteristics include a sharp-pointed nose, narrow eyes, and high cheekbones. 2. Why are people from North East India still referred to as Chinese? How do North East Indians feel about it? Step 1: Consider the historical background and geographical context that may contribute to the confusion between North-east Indians and Chinese. Step 2: Explain the reason: Some people might refer to North-east Indian people as\\"Chinese\\" due to their physical appearances resembling those of East Asian populations. This linkage is predominantly driven by a lack of understanding and awareness about the diverse ethnicities present in India and Asia. Step 3: Discuss North-east Indians' feelings about this misidentification: Many North-east Indians feel frustrated and offended by this mislabeling as it diminishes their unique cultural identities. It reflects a lack of understanding and appreciation for their diverse backgrounds. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Step 1: Reiterate the three questions. Step 2: Analyze their meanings: - Question 1 asks about physical traits differentiating certain Asian groups from one another. - Question 2 seeks to understand why North-east Indians are sometimes referred to as Chinese and their feelings about this misidentification. - Question 3 asks if the previously mentioned questions have the same meaning. Step 3: Draw a conclusion: The questions might be interconnected but do not have the same meaning. Question 1 and 2 involve differentiating people based on ethnicity and understanding the reasons behind misidentification, while Question 3 serves as a meta-question, asking about the meanings of the previous questions. In conclusion, these questions might be related to ethnicity and identity but address different aspects, making them distinct from each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you are struggling to get motivated, think about other times where you were able to stay on track and accomplish your goals. Think about the outcome of what you accomplished and how you felt when you succeeded. For example, if you are struggling with motivation to exercise, think about a time when you powered through and exercised and felt great afterwards. Think about how you felt during your workout, and how you felt about yourself afterwards for pushing yourself to pursue a worthy goal like getting fit. Even if you don't feel motivated, just try getting started anyways. Sometimes we build things up in our minds and make them seem like they are going to be way worse than they actually are. This is called affective forecasting, and we tend to be terrible at it. By the time you get started you will often find that things aren't so bad. For example, if you are having trouble getting motivated to write a book, open the keyboard and just start typing. Tell yourself that you will type for 5 minutes and if you still aren't motivated you will stop. You may find that by tricking yourself into starting, you will gain motivation and continue to write for much longer than 5 minutes. Part of the battle with motivation is that there are often other seemingly more interesting things in our environment vying for our attention. You can help become motivated to do something by removing the possibility to engage in other actions. For example, if you are trying to get motivated to do your homework but you keep getting distracted by text messaging friends or browsing the web on your phone, then turn your phone off. Once your phone is off, place it somewhere that you cannot see it, such as deep in your bag. Make it difficult to get to; move your bag so that it is out of your reach. Once you no longer have the easily accessible options of texting with friends or browsing the web, you may find that the alternatives to not doing your homework are not as exciting, and so finding the motivation to do your homework may become easier. A great way to stop being distracted by video games or browsing the internet is blocking it off for a period of time. One of the tools that could be used for this is a software called Cold Turkey which is free. Some people are motivated by competition. Think back on your past and whether there have been cases where you were motivated to accomplish something because you were competing with someone else (or yourself). If this rings true for you, then foster some friendly competition. The other person doesn’t necessarily need to know that you are competing with them, even. You can turn to others to help you with motivation. Tell your friends and family about what you hope to accomplish and what you are struggling with. Don't struggle to tell them thinking what will they think about it. Talking it out with them can help you stay motivated and keep negative feelings that sap motivation at bay. Surround yourself with people who are positive and are themselves motivated to accomplish their goals. You can catch their positive emotions and positivity and this will help you to be motivated. Summary:","completion":"To overcome struggles with motivation, recall past achievements, combat affective forecasting by just starting, eliminate distractions, engage in friendly competition, seek support from friends and family, and surround yourself with positive, goal-driven individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater.

Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture. Which farm causes more algae to grow out of control? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided and the hint, it is evident that Bold farm, which uses large amounts of fertilizers, would cause more algae to grow out of control compared to Shallow farm, which utilizes organic methods and permaculture practices. When Bold farm uses excessive amounts of fertilizers, the chemicals containing nitrogen and phosphorus can dissolve in rainwater, leading to a higher concentration of these nutrients in the soil. As runoff carries away the dissolved nutrients, they eventually end up in nearby bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes, rivers, and even oceans. This process is known as nutrient pollution or eutrophication. The presence of high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water promotes the rapid growth and multiplication of algae, resulting in algal blooms. These algal blooms can negatively impact water quality, aquatic ecosystems, and even human health. As mentioned, when algae die, decomposers break down their dead tissues. In the process, decomposers consume a significant amount of oxygen available in the water, leading to oxygen depletion. Oxygen depletion, or hypoxia, can result in the formation of dead zones – areas with insufficient levels of dissolved oxygen to support most marine life. The Gulf of Mexico dead zone is a prime example of this phenomenon. The rivers that drain into the Gulf carry fertilizers from agricultural lands, contributing to the growing dead zone issue. On the other hand, Shallow farm uses organic methods and permaculture principles, which generally include practices such as composting, cover cropping, crop rotation, and the use of natural, sustainable fertilizers. These practices help increase soil fertility, enhance biodiversity, and maintain a healthy soil ecosystem, minimizing the risk of nutrient pollution and algal blooms. In conclusion, Bold farm, with its heavy use of fertilizers, is more likely to cause algae growth out of control, leading to negative environmental consequences like dead zones. In contrast, Shallow farm's adoption of organic and permaculture methods reduces the potential for nutrient pollution and its adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Death: Daniel Jones, who ingested a small but lethal amount of heroin at his home in Wolverhampton. A toddler killed when he took a fatal heroin overdose in. the house where he lived with his drug-addicted parents was failed by social services, according to a report. In May last year, 23-month-old Daniel Jones ingested a tiny but. lethal amount of heroin at the family’s home in Wolverhampton. A serious case review published today concluded those. tasked with looking out for the toddler failed to properly assess the risk. of harm presented to him by his parent’s habitual drug use. If care workers, doctors and health professionals had been. more ‘professionally curious’, had more ‘respectful uncertainty’ and been ‘more. assertive’ in their approach to the family, Daniel’s death may have been. avoidable, it concluded. The report stated there had been ‘a number of missed. opportunities’ to intervene in the boy’s care by the different agencies. involved. However, it also acknowledged there had been ‘examples of good inter-agency. working’. The report’s authors also said despite the. parents’ long-standing drug addiction, none of the care workers involved in the. case foresaw the risk that Daniel might be exposed to heroin, or other. substances. Earlier this year, Daniel’s father Simon Jones, 30, was. jailed for six years after admitting the boy’s manslaughter. His mother. Emma Bradburn, 34, received four years after pleading guilty to allowing the. toddler’s death. Jones fully accepted culpability for his son’s death, admitting he had been taking heroin when his son fell ill. Bradburn was drug-tested following her arrest and found to be clear of the. drug. At their sentencing hearing in July this year, judge Mrs. Justice Thirlwall told the couple it was beyond doubt they had loved their. little boy but, she added: ‘You failed woefully to protect him from the very. obvious dangers you exposed him to. ‘The danger was mortal danger, as you should have realised,’ she said. Following the death, Wolverhampton Safeguarding Children. Board immediately launched a serious case review - carried out whenever a child. has died and abuse or neglect is suspected to have been a factor. The board’s chairman Alan Coe said: ‘What comes across very. strongly from this serious case review is that practitioners who worked with. Daniel and his family should have looked beyond his apparent well-being and. understood what life was like from his perspective. ‘That they failed to do this is clearly unacceptable, and we. have a duty to Daniel to ensure that, as far as is possible, the same thing. doesn’t happen again.’ He added many parents, who had drug addictions, coped with. being parents. The report has put forward 44 recommendations, which have. now either been acted upon or are being implemented, relating to better support. for frontline staff, improvement to working practices and particularly. assessments of the risk harm to a child, and also better inter-agency. communication. Addiction: Daniel's father Simon Jones, 30 and Emma Bradburn, 34, pictured with their son at their Wolverhampton home. They both used drugs in the house. Both Jones - who had served time in jail for. robbery and Bradburn, 34, were known to. the addiction services team which at the time was run by the Black Country. Partnership NHS Foundation Trust prior to Daniel’s birth. There was a history of domestic trouble between the couple,. with Bradburn, a heavy drinker, on a prescription for methadone, having been a. heroin addict for 12 years. When she became pregnant with Daniel, they were referred to. Wolverhampton City Council’s children’s services, and following his birth his. development was monitored by health visitors from The Royal Wolverhampton NHS. Trust. The report found that 'Daniel died as a result of an event. that had not been foreseen by any of the professionals involved with the. family' but concluded a more assertive approach by care workers might have made. all the difference. Findings: Had social services been more 'professionally curious' and. been 'more assertive' in their approach to the family, Daniel's death. may have been avoidable, a report today concluded. It acknowledged the parents had not always been. co-operative, but concluded this had made follow-up work all the more. important. However, the report set out the frequent examples where it. found those checks were simply not carried out, or followed through on. There were 11 multi-agency Child in Need meetings between. the parents and care and health workers. But the report’s authors said the. action plans developing out of these meetings were 'not robust and did not. sufficiently address the risks to Daniel of his parents’ substance use.' ‘There do not appear to have been any significant changes. effected by the Child in Need plan over the almost two years that it had been. in place.’ Bradburn, suffering constant pain and disability from a. severe accident prior to the birth of her son, was getting medication from her. GP but also topped up the methadone she was prescribed by taking heroin, she. said, to cope with her on-going discomfort. The report said: ‘Unfortunately there was no collaborative. working between the GP practice and the addiction service, which may have. better addressed her pain and reduced her need for illicit drugs.’ Board chairman Mr Coe said the parents’ drug-use meant their ‘capacity to. meet his needs was compromised’, adding different care and health workers had ‘failed. to fully understand the potential impact of their drug use on Daniel’. ‘Their focus was too much on the parents, and not enough on. their son and the family unit as a whole. ‘Their assessments depended on the parents’ co-operation and. candour, and this was not always forthcoming. ‘Had the practitioners challenged them properly, they may. have appreciated the full extent of the potential risks that Daniel faced.’ Mr Coe added: ‘It is important to stress that things do. change as a result of tragedies like this. Already, we’ve seen a number of. improvements.’ He said the board would be monitoring the implementation of. its recommendations. Aware: Both Jones, who had served time in jail for robbery and Bradburn,. both pictured, were known to the local addiction services team prior to. Daniel's birth.

He added: ‘If the parents are deemed capable of looking. after their child, they must be given, and be seen to act upon, clear advice. about ensuring their children remain safe.This didn’t happen in this instance.’ He added the council had fully accepted all the. recommendations, had implemented changes, and was ‘determined to do all we can. to help prevent a similar tragedy from happening again’. ‘Once again, I’d like to offer our sympathies to Daniel’s. family and reassure them that, through the changes we and our partner agencies. are making, we will be doing all we can to keep our children and young people. safer in the future.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses the tragic case of 23-month-old Daniel Jones, who died after ingesting a lethal amount of heroin at his family's home in Wolverhampton. A serious case review, published on the 20th of December 2013, found that Daniel was failed by social services as different agencies involved failed to properly assess the risk of harm presented to him by his drug-addicted parents. The report states that if care workers, doctors, and health professionals had been more \\"professionally curious,\\" \\"respectful uncertainty,\\" and \\"more assertive\\" in their approach to the family, Daniel's death may have been avoidable. The parents, Simon Jones (Serving six years in jail for manslaughter) and Emma Bradburn (Serving four years for allowing the toddler's death), were already known to local addiction services and children's services. The report put forward 44 recommendations relating to better support for frontline staff, improvement to working practices, particularly assessments of the risk of harm to a child, and better inter-agency communication."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them. I am facing a new situation today: John wanted to know what makes a lake different from a pond. To that end, he first visited a lake. He labeled that part of the study as case A. Then he visited a pond. He labeled that part of the study as case B. John realized that though both of them were water-bodies, they were very different.

I then provided the answer as \\"tropic and sex,\\" which are the two main categories of hormones that play a vital role in the regulation of mammalian reproduction. Tropic hormones, also known as gonadotropic hormones, are produced mainly by the anterior pituitary gland. They mainly regulate the growth and function of the gonads (testes and ovaries) in both males and females. The primary tropic hormones involved in mammalian reproduction are luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Sex hormones, on the other hand, are produced by the gonads and adrenal glands. They are responsible for the development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and also play a role in sexual behavior and fertility. The main sex hormones involved in mammalian reproduction are estrogens, progestogens, and androgens. By understanding and explaining the roles of these hormones, it is clear how tropic and sex hormones regulate mammalian reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less oxygen is absorbed by blood vessels happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that less oxygen is absorbed by blood vessels in the process of respiration. If this were to happen, it would directly affect the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. Step-by-step analysis of the perturbation's effect on the process: 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes. 2. Air enters bronchioles. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli. 4. Alveoli are surrounded by small blood vessels. 5. Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels: In this case, the hypothesis says less oxygen is being absorbed by the blood vessels, which will lead to a decrease in the amount of oxygen available in the blood. 6. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body: Since less oxygen is absorbed by blood vessels, there would be less oxygen available to be delivered to the cells, affecting their functioning. 7. Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs: Even with less oxygen in the bloodstream, the blood would still carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs, but the body will be functioning at a lower efficiency due to lack of sufficient oxygen. 8. Carbon dioxide released when you exhale: The carbon dioxide will still be released when you exhale, but the body's overall demand for oxygen may increase, possibly leading to an increase in breathing rate or shortness of breath as it attempts to compensate for the lower oxygen levels. The perturbation's effect on the process is that a lesser amount of oxygen is absorbed by the blood vessels, causing a decreased amount of oxygen to be delivered to the bloodstream. This affects the body's ability to function efficiently and may lead to an increased demand for oxygen, which could result in changes in breathing rate or shortness of breath.

Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice.

Article: American teenager Thomas Cheatham had planned to study Latin during his sophomore year at Hebron High School in Texas. But when he learned that the school district was going to offer a Mandarin class, he quickly changed his mind. \\"I thought it (Mandarin) would be more beneficial than Latin,\\" said Cheatham, who is now in his second year of studying the language.

Seeing how calmly he handled the situation, Father Matthew tells Michael he is called to be a priest, whether Michael believes this or not; he later approaches Michael with an invitation to travel to Rome in order to attend a class on exorcism. Michael reluctantly accepts after being told by Father Matthew that he will be levied a 100,000 student loan if he leaves immediately, but that if he still desires to resign from his position after taking the class, then he may be free to leave.During classes, he meets a young woman, Angelina (Alice Braga), who is also taking the course. He soon learns that she is a reporter who has been asked to cover the course for an article in a newspaper.

Answer:","completion":"Answer: (a). negative. The sentiment of the sentence \\"uneven performances\\" would likely be perceived as negative. The term \\"uneven\\" often implies inconsistency, irregularity, or unsteadiness. In the context of performances, it suggests that the quality of the performances varied, with some parts being good and others not so good, which prevents them from being considered entirely successful or satisfying. This inconsistency is typically not regarded as a desirable trait in a performance, as people usually expect and appreciate consistency in quality. The sentiment could be interpreted as a mild critique or a hint of disappointment, as it points out that the performance could have been better or consistently good. In contrast, if the sentiment were to be perceived as positive, the sentence might have used terms like \\"dynamic performances\\" or \\"skilled performances,\\" which would emphasize the strong and captivating aspects of a performance. However, the use of \\"uneven\\" in this instance leans more towards a negative connotation, indicating that the quality of the performances was not uniformly praiseworthy. Overall, the sentiment of the sentence \\"uneven performances\\" would be perceived as negative, as it highlights the inconsistencies and fluctuations in the performances' quality, suggesting a less-than-satisfactory experience for the viewers or listeners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: The disputed South China Sea will soon see increased U.S. military activity from five Philippine bases, following the signing of a deal between Manila and Washington that will allow the Pentagon to deploy conventional forces to the Philippines for the first time in decades. The deal — called an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement — was reached Friday between State Department officials and the government of the Philippines, and will allow the Pentagon to use parts of five military installations: Antonio Bautista Air Base, Basa Air Base, Fort Magsaysay, Lumbia Air Base, and Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base. It comes at a time when the United States and its allies in the region have expressed concern about China increasingly deploying military assets to man-made islands in the South China Sea. China has laid claim to a number of islands in the South China Sea, building airbases on tiny spits of land while installing powerful radar and missile launchers. Here's why. (Jason Aldag,Julie Vitkovskaya/The Washington Post) State Department spokesman John Kirby, a retired two-star Navy admiral, said that the United States has “made absolutely no bones about the fact that we take the rebalance to the Asia Pacific region very seriously.” But he added that there is “nothing offensive or provocative” about any of the Pentagon’s deployment of troops to the region. [China testing Obama as it expands its influence in Southeast Asia] “It’s not about selling it to the Chinese or to anybody,” Kirby said, under questioning during a media briefing. “It’s about meeting our security commitments in a serious alliance with the Philippines. That’s what this is about.” The map above shows where the bases are. Antonio Bautista Air Base, on the island of Palawan, is a few dozen miles east of the disputed Spratly Islands, where China’s military buildup is underway. Basa Air Base is also near the South China Sea, and is in a rural area outside Manila. Bautista Air Base is the closest installation the Philippines has to the Spratlys, according to Philippine air force. Other bases were considered, according to Philippine media reports, but ultimately not included in the agreement. China raised questions about the plan Monday, saying that cooperation between the United States and the Philippines should not harm the sovereignty or security interests of any other country. “The U.S. has talked about militarization in the South China Sea. But can it explain whether its own increased military deployment in the region is equivalent to militarization?” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a media briefing, according to Xinhua, a state-run news agency. The United States had a conventional military presence in the Philippines for nearly a century until 1991, when the country ordered the U.S. military to leave its naval base in Subic Bay after the countries could not reach an agreement on the extension of a lease. A U.S. Special Operations task force was based in the Philippines for 13 years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, but was phased out last year in favor of keeping a small amount of U.S. troops nearby to assist Philippine forces in their fight against Islamist militants.

Context: The Bithynians were a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia. After Alexander's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I, and assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BCE. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle.

Here are some concepts: bed, comforter, side What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"A bed with a plush comforter set out on the side can be an inviting sight, depicting the point of tranquility, relaxation, and rest in a bustling world. In general, these three concepts - bed, comforter and side, play pivotal roles in creating an atmosphere conducive for sleep and relaxation. The bed, acting as the central base unit, consists of a sturdy, comfortable, and spacious platform whereon people lay to rest, sleep, or even perform other relaxation activities like reading, watching TV, or simply lying down after a long day. A good-quality bed is essential for maintaining proper ergonomics and body posture; it's designed to support the back and align the spine while one is lying down to ensure a restful, undisturbed sleep. A comforter, on the other hand, acts as a warming blanket. As its name suggests, it provides comfort to the user by warming them up in cold environments, offering a soft feeling, and adding to the overall aesthetics of the bed. It comes in a variety of materials like down, synthetic fibers, cotton, etc., that decide the level of warmth and ease it will provide. Some people love the weighted feeling of a comforter, valuing the security and snugness it provides. The thickness, texture and size all add to how a comforter enhances the sleep experience. The concept of 'side' in this context can be deciphered in two ways. One interpretation can be related to the side of the bed. Everybody has a preferred side on the bed; it's like an unspoken agreement. Some people prefer the right side while some lean towards the left. This choice can be due to multiple factors like the position of the bed in the room, proximity to a nightstand, charging point, window or even simple personal preference. Another interpretation of 'side' may refer to having a comforter or any other item such as a book, water bottle, phone, etc., by one's side while lying on the bed. This again is a personal preference and depends on one's habits before sleep. Many people have certain routines they follow before sleeping, and these could include reading a book, scrolling through social media, or perhaps sipping some water or late-night tea. In conclusion, the synergy of these three concepts - bed, comforter, and side, form an essential part of our everyday life, contributing towards a comforting and restful sleep experience. It forms the crux of our sleeping arrangements, whereby a cozy bed and a warm comforter, along with personal side preferences, come together to offer us a comforting sanctuary after a hectic day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the work that was criticised as old-fashioned? Sir William Turner Walton, OM (29 March 1902 – 8 March 1983) was an English composer. During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include Façade, the cantata Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems Crown Imperial and Orb and Sceptre. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.

By Tom Leonard PUBLISHED: 17:31 EST, 25 December 2012 | UPDATED: 17:35 EST, 25 December 2012 More than 65,000 Americans have called for Piers Morgan to be deported from the U.S. after he criticized pro-gun campaigners on his chat show. A petition on the White House website accuses the television presenter of undermining the 'rights of Americans.' Any petition posted on the site that attracts more than 25,000 signatures guarantees a response from the U.S. government. Last week Mr Morgan repeatedly attacked pro-gun guests on his nightly CNN shows following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20 children and six staff died. 'A lot of it comes from his being","completion":"a British citizen expressing opinions on American issues, particularly on such a sensitive topic like gun control. The views that Piers Morgan shared on his CNN show did not sit well with the pro-gun supporters in the United States, which led them to initiate the petition to deport him. Piers Morgan's calls for stricter gun control in the U.S. on his show directly challenged the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees the right to bear arms. Many Americans feel very strongly about their right to own firearms, and Morgan's remarks were seen as not only inflammatory but also a direct attack on their constitutional rights. This led to a strong backlash against the television presenter and resulted in the petition. The petition, which was posted on the White House website, grew rapidly in popularity, achieving the necessary 25,000 signatures that guarantee a response from the U.S. government. While the petition may have been successful in catching the administration's attention, it is important to note that the idea of deporting someone over their opinions on political issues is inherently problematic. The U.S. prides itself on the values of free speech and individual liberty, and it is in this context that any response from the government must be made. In response to the petition, the-then White House Press Secretary Jay Carney acknowledged that the petition had reached the signature threshold and would receive a response, but emphasized that it would be consistent with their dedication to the fundamental principles of free speech. Later, the Obama administration reiterated its commitment to the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, and stated that it would not \\"deport someone who engaged in the political debate.\\" Ultimately, the petition to deport Piers Morgan did not succeed in achieving its goal. However, it did serve to create a significant amount of publicity regarding the broader debate over gun control in the United States. It demonstrated the passion and intensity with which many Americans defend their right to bear arms and also exposed the massive divide that exists in the country over the issue of gun control. Piers Morgan continued hosting his show on CNN until 2014 when it was canceled due to low ratings. While Morgan was not deported for his remarks on gun control, the controversy surrounding the debate highlighted the challenges that come with navigating the complex and contentious issues that often arise in a diverse and politically charged society such as the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Why were all electric computers seen as superioir to the z2?\\" Context: \\"Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"All-electric computers were considered superior to the Z2 for several reasons, including speed, reliability, efficiency, and technological advancements. The Z2, designed by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was an early example of an electromechanical relay computer which used electric switches to drive mechanical relays for performing calculations. Despite its innovative design for the time, it was eventually outperformed by all-electric computers that utilized vacuum tubes and later, transistors. 1. Speed: One of the primary reasons why all-electric computers were seen as superior to the Z2 is the difference in operating speeds. Electromechanical relay computers like the Z2 were generally slower because they relied on mechanical components to complete calculations. The movement of mechanical parts took significantly longer than the near-instantaneous flow of electrons in electric circuits. All-electric computers, on the other hand, took advantage of vacuum tubes, which allowed for much faster switching and processing times. This leap in speed made electric computers more suitable for complex calculations and simulations. 2. Reliability: The mechanical parts in the Z2 were prone to wear and tear, which led to reduced reliability over time. All-electric computers, given their lack of moving parts, were less susceptible to mechanical failure and therefore offered a more dependable performance. Moreover, the vacuum tubes in all-electric computers provided a more stable operating environment, reducing the risk of errors and contributing to a more accurate and consistent processing of information. 3. Efficiency: In addition to speed and reliability, all-electric computers were also more energy-efficient than their electromechanical counterparts. Whereas the Z2 required a significant amount of energy to power its electric switches and mechanical relays, all-electric computers were able to perform the same tasks using less power. This was because vacuum tubes and, later, transistors, required less energy to switch on and off compared to the mechanical operations of an electromechanical computer. This improved energy efficiency also led to reduced operational costs, making all-electric computers a more attractive choice for businesses and research institutions. 4. Technological Advancements: The development of electronic components such as vacuum tubes and transistors allowed for even greater advancements in computing technology. These advancements resulted in the miniaturization of electronic devices and the integration of multiple electronic components on a single substrate, leading to the development of integrated circuits and microprocessors. This progress formed the basis of modern computers, which offered increased processing capabilities and versatility in their applications. 5. Expandability and Scalability: Electric computers had the advantage of being more easily expandable and scalable compared to electromechanical systems like the Z2. As new components were developed, they could be added to existing electric computer systems to improve performance or functionality. This ability to increase computing power with additional components made all-electric computers a more appealing choice for researchers and scientists, who required ever-more powerful machines to tackle increasingly complex problems. In summary, all-electric computers were considered superior to the electromechanical Z2 for several reasons, such as increased speed, reliability, efficiency, technological advancements, and expandability. The development of vacuum tubes and, later, transistors, paved the way for modern computer systems, leaving the Z2 and other electromechanical computers as an important, but ultimately less capable, stepping stone in the history of computing technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is something that all human have, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our parents, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Mr. Mendel discovered why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things called \\"genes\\" in our body. In 1953, two scientists, Watson and Crick, found out that those small parts are really messages. They're written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, another two scientists found the first \\"word\\" that they could understand in that language. It shows how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. So far, scientists have found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \\"word\\" means, we can help to save people from several illnesses. So the more we understand, the more doctors will be able to do. Most people hope that this will help to make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when we learn more \\"words\\" and and find out more information, we will use it in the wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people getting jobs. Question: When did Mr. Mendel discover why we look the same as other people in our family? Yes or no, is the answer \\"In 1860\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"In 1860.\\" Mr. Mendel discovered why we look the same as other people in our family during that year. His discovery was based on understanding the role of genes, which are small components in our body that determine our traits and appearances. These genes are part of the larger genetic material called DNA, which serves as a \\"map\\" for the human body and influences the development and functioning of living organisms. Mendel's groundbreaking work laid the foundation for the field of genetics, paving the way for future discoveries that would eventually lead to more detailed knowledge about DNA and how it works. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick identified the structure of DNA as a double helix, revealing that genes are essentially coded messages. Later on, in 1961, scientists discovered the first \\"word\\" in the genetic code, which provided further understanding of how DNA instructs cells to build their components. Although the complete \\"map\\" of the human DNA has been identified, there is still much to learn about the specific functions of all the genes within it. As scientists continue to decipher the language of DNA, they hope to apply this expanding knowledge to the development of more effective medical treatments and therapies. This, in turn, will enable doctors to address a wide range of illnesses and improve the overall quality of healthcare. However, there are also concerns that misuse of this information could lead to unethical practices, such as using genetic information to discriminate against individuals or for purely superficial purposes, like enhancing physical attractiveness. Despite these potential drawbacks, the ongoing exploration of the human genome promises to yield invaluable insights into our biological makeup, ultimately helping us better understand ourselves and the world around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: That is the conclusion of scientists after reviewing all the pictures and other data gathered in the deep impact bowl by Nasa's Curiosity rover. Chemolithoautotrophs do not need light to function; instead, they break down rocks and minerals for energy. On Earth, they exist underground, in caves and at the bottom of the ocean. In Mars' Gale Crater, such organisms would have found just as conducive a setting, and one that the scientists now think could have lasted for many millions of years. \\"For all of us geologists who are very familiar with what the early Earth must have been like, what we see in Gale really doesn't look much different,\\" Curiosity chief scientist Prof John Grotzinger told BBC News. He was speaking here in San Francisco at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, the largest annual gathering of Earth and planetary researchers. His team is providing the conference with a status update on the rover, while simultaneously publishing six scholarly papers online in the journal Science. Some of what is described in these papers, we have heard before. But there is now additional detail that should lend credibility to the earlier claims. Most of the discussion centres on a six-month investigation of a shallow depression in the crater floor close to the robot's August 2012 landing site. Known as Yellowknife bay, this topographic low has been shown through the drilling and chemical analysis of rock samples to contain ancient mudstones. Today, they are cold, dry and dusty, but their sediments were originally laid down in water that flowed in streams and eventually pooled into a lake. It is clear the conditions at the time of deposition would have been more than suitable for a wide range of microbial lifeforms. The scientists can tell that water - the \\"lubricant\\" of life - was significant and persistent in Gale, and that it must have been broadly neutral in pH, and not at all briney. Much of this is evident from the presence of clay minerals, which tend to form only under particular conditions. \\"I think what's very important here is that we've now made the case that these clay minerals were formed in situ,\\" said Prof Grotzinger. \\"They were not detrital; they were not blown in. They are representative of the aqueous environment that is suggested by the [look of the rocks], and that environment would have been a habitable one.\\" Key to this habitability is the availability of essential elements, such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen and phosphorous. Curiosity has found them all to be present, and in a form that microbes could have accessed. The robot also detects minerals and compounds in various states of oxidation, which organisms could have exploited in simple reactions to obtain the energy needed to drive metabolism. The depression where Curiosity found the mudstones is only about 60m across, but the geologists on the science team believe this is just one small exposed area, and that the rock member (it has been dubbed \\"Sheepbed\\") may extend up to 30 square km or more, hidden beneath other sediments. The thickness of the mudstone layer also hints at the length of time the water might have been present. Curiosity scientists estimate this to be perhaps hundreds to thousands of years, just based on the visible Sheepbed layers. When the other rocks lying on top of the mudstones are taken into account - rocks that unmistakably also have been touched by water at some point - it is entirely plausible the wet environments in Gale persisted from millions to tens of millions of years. \\"Even if a surface lake dries up temporarily, there should still be groundwater in the shallow subsurface,\\" said Prof Grotzinger. \\"And because we're advocating chemolithoautotrophy and not photoautotrophy, those chemolithoautotrophs should be just fine down in the groundwater, and when the lake comes back again they just rise up to the surface and carry on.\\" And there are some tighter constraints now on when in Mars' history these benign conditions existed, because Curiosity has been able to date the mudstones by measuring the ratio of radioactive potassium and argon atoms found within them. The result is 4.21 billion years (plus or minus 350 million years). \\"It's been a dream to do radiometric dating on Mars,\\" said Curiosity participating scientist Prof Ken Farley. \\"Prior to these measurements, the only way you could determine time was by counting impact craters, using a model derived from Earth's Moon where rocks have actually been dated. The model is then scaled to Mars, but it is quite uncertain,\\" he told BBC News. Care has to be taken in interpreting the Curiosity result, however. It refers to the age of the source minerals in the sediments washed into the lake and not the actual time of the mudstones' deposition. This would probably have been several hundred million years later. A different technique also reveals when erosion exposed the mudstone surface seen on the planet today. This was about 78 million years ago (give or take 30 million years) - very recent, geologically speaking. The result is significant because it will guide the strategy on where Curiosity should drill in future to find organic (carbon-rich) molecules. Their detection is a goal of the mission, but they are easily degraded in Mars' harsh radiation environment. The dating work, however, tells the science team to look for locations that are very freshly eroded, even more recently than the Sheepbed drilling points. Organics could very well survive in such places just a few centimetres below the surface. Organic molecules are important because they bear down further on the habitability question. All life as we know it trades on complex carbon chemistry.

While the two questions may appear similar at first glance, they actually differ in terms of the desert that the Gobi Desert's average temperatures are being compared to. The first question asks for a comparison of the Gobi Desert's average temperatures with those of the Sahara Desert, while the second question seeks a comparison with the Great Sandy Desert. The Gobi Desert is located in northern China and southern Mongolia and has a wide range of temperatures, sometimes experiencing extreme cold. The Sahara Desert is situated in North Africa and is the largest hot desert in the world, with temperatures that can become extremely hot during the day but can also drop significantly at night. On the other hand, the Great Sandy Desert is located in Australia and consists mostly of sand dunes and sparse vegetation, with a harsh climate that includes high temperatures and low precipitation rates. Thus, comparing the Gobi Desert with the Sahara Desert and the Great Sandy Desert will yield different insights and results.
