Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - A traveling carnival (US English), usually simply called a carnival, is an amusement show that may be made up of amusement rides, food vendors, merchandise vendors, games of chance and skill, thrill acts, and animal acts. A traveling carnival is not set up at a permanent location, like an amusement park, but is moved from place to place. Its roots are similar to the 19th century circus with both being set up in open fields near or in town and moving to a new location after a period of time. Unlike traditional carnival celebrations, the North American traveling carnival is not tied to a religious observance. - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - A holiday is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, especially business or work, are suspended or reduced. Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance. Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations. The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job being held or even personal choices. - The resurrection of Jesus is the Christian religious belief that, after being put to death, Jesus rose again from the dead. It is the central tenet of Christian theology and part of the Nicene Creed: \\"On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures\\". - A travelling funfair, often simply called a fair, is a small to medium-sized travelling show primarily composed of stalls and other amusements. - Calvary, also Gagulta, was, according to the Gospels, a site immediately outside Jerusalem's walls where Jesus was crucified. \\"Golgotha(s)\\" is the Greek transcription in the New Testament of the Aramaic term \\"Gagultâ\\". The Bible translates the term to mean \\"place of [the] skull\\", which in Greek is (\\"Kraníou Tópos\\"), and in Latin is \\"Calvariæ Locus\\", from which the English word \\"Calvary\\" is derived. - A fair (archaic: faire or fayre) is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities. It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is temporary with scheduled times lasting from an afternoon to several weeks. - Great Lent, or the Great Fast, (Greek: or , meaning \\"Great 40 Days,\\" and \\"Great Fast,\\" respectively) is the most important fasting season in the church year in the Byzantine Rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church including Western Rite Orthodoxy and the Eastern Catholic Churches, which prepares Christians for the greatest feast of the church year, Pascha (Easter). - Lent (Latin: Quadragesima: \\"Fortieth\\") is a solemn religious observance in the liturgical calendar that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends approximately six weeks later, before Easter Sunday. The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer through prayer, doing penance, repentance of sins, almsgiving, atonement, and self-denial. This event is observed by Christians in the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic Churches. Some Anabaptist and evangelical churches also observe the Lenten season. Its institutional purpose is heightened in the annual commemoration of Holy Week, marking the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, which recalls the tradition and events of the New Testament beginning on Friday of Sorrows, further climaxing on Jesus' crucifixion on Good Friday, which ultimately culminates in the joyful celebration on Easter Sunday of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Efteling is a fantasy-themed amusement park in Kaatsheuvel in the Netherlands. The attractions are based on elements from ancient myths and legends, fairy tales, fables, and folklore. - The Flying Dutchman ( or \`\` De Vliegende Hollander '' in Dutch ) is a combination of a water coaster and a dark ride in amusement park Efteling in the Netherlands . It should have gone operational on April 16 , 2006 Easter , exactly 328 years after the disappearance of the legendary Dutch man of war The Flying Dutchman ; due to construction problems the opening was postponed to April 1 , 2007 . - Easter, also called Pascha \\"(Greek/Latin)\\" or Resurrection Sunday, is a festival and holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, described in the New Testament as having occurred on the third day of his burial after his crucifixion by Romans at Calvary 30 AD. It is the culmination of the Passion of Jesus, preceded by Lent (or Great Lent), a forty-day period of fasting, prayer, and penance. - Resurrection is the concept of a living being coming back to life after death. In a number of ancient religions, a dying-and-rising god is a deity which dies and resurrects. The death and resurrection of Jesus, an example of resurrection, is the central focus of Christianity. - Kaatsheuvel is a village in the Dutch province of North Brabant, situated along highways N261 and N628. With a population of roughly 16,600, it is the largest village in and the capital of the municipality of Loon op Zand, which also consists of the villages of De Moer and Loon op Zand. As Kaatsheuvel is a municipality capital, it had a town hall located in the town centre. The town hall was torn down in 2010 as part of an ambitious plan to build a lively new town centre. Currently the new town centre is being built, working title \\"Bruisend Dorpshart\\" (Sparkling Village's Heart). Kaatsheuvel is (internationally) well known for the Efteling theme park and a gateway to National Park Loonse en Drunense Duinen. - An amusement park (sometimes referred to as a funfair) or theme park is a group of entertainment attractions, rides, and other events in a location for the enjoyment of large numbers of people. Amusement parks have a fixed location, as opposed to travelling funfairs and traveling carnivals, and are more elaborate than simple city parks or playgrounds, usually providing attractions meant to cater specifically to certain age groups, as well as some that are aimed towards all ages. Theme parks, a specific type of amusement park, are usually much more intricately themed to a certain subject or group of subjects than normal amusement parks. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Penance is repentance of sins as well as the proper name of the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation/Confession. It also plays a part in non-sacramental confession among Lutherans and other Protestants. The word \\"penance\\" derives from Old French and Latin \\"paenitentia\\", both of which derive from the same root meaning repentance, the desire to be forgiven (in English see contrition). Penance and repentance, similar in their derivation and original sense, have come to symbolize conflicting views of the essence of repentance, arising from the controversy as to the respective merits of \\"faith\\" and \\"good works\\". Word derivations occur in many languages. - In Christianity, the Passion (from Late Latin: \\"passionem\\" \\"suffering, enduring\\") is the short final period in the life of Jesus covering his entrance visit to Jerusalem and leading to his crucifixion on Mount Calvary, defining the climactic event central to Christian doctrine of Salvation History. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. - Fasting is a willing abstinence or reduction from some or all food, drink, or both, for a period of time. An absolute fast (dry fasting) is normally defined as abstinence from all food and liquid for a defined period, usually a period of 24 hours, or a number of days. Water fasting allows drinking water but nothing else. Other fasts may be partially restrictive, limiting only particular foods or substances. A fast may also be intermittent in nature. Fasting practices may preclude intercourse and other activities as well as food.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Joy Division's style quickly evolved from their punk roots. Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as generic and \\"undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\\". Critic Simon Reynolds observed how the band's originality only \\"really became apparent as the songs got slower\\", and their music took on a \\"sparse\\" quality. According to Reynolds, \\"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\\" According to music critic Jon Savage, \\"Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy\\". In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound \\"came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.\\" By Closer, Curtis had adapted a low baritone voice, drawing comparisons to Jim Morrison of the Doors (one of Curtis's favourite bands). Sumner largely acted as the band's director, a role he continued in New Order. While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument on a few recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, \\"He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, because no one else would play like Ian\\". During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody. Hannett \\"dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality\\". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, \\"[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue\\". Hannett demanded clean and clear \\"sound separation\\" not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, \\"Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound\\". Music journalist Richard Cook noted that Hannett's role was \\"crucial\\". There are \\"devices of distance\\" in his production and \\"the sound is an illusion of physicality\\".

Obama calls on Europeans to help solve global woes By Kathy Kiely, USA TODAY BERLIN  Barack Obama is betting he can win votes at home by proving he can win hearts abroad. The Democratic presidential candidate, as he neared the end of his seven-country foreign trip, staged an unusual public rally here Thursday that drew more than 200,000 people to a historic park that is Berlin's equivalent of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It was the emotional high point of a trip that demonstrated that Obama has the staying power for the rigors of a fall campaign and the star power to draw a big, enthusiastic crowd into a foreign capital. Obama closes out his 16,000-mile odyssey, which began in Afghanistan and Iraq, with calls on French President Nicolas Sarkozy today and several top British leaders, including Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Saturday. For Obama, the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that \\"was necessary to pass,\\" said Edward Haley, a specialist in politics and international relations at Claremont McKenna College in California. \\"It looks as if he's done far better than just passing. He's aced this tour,\\" Haley added. \\"If there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage, I think he's more than answered that. He hasn't put a foot wrong in any of these places.\\" Getting a head start on the role he hopes to play as leader of the free world, Obama in Berlin made a direct appeal to citizens of other countries to help solve global problems such as terrorism, climate change, nuclear weapons proliferation, and free and fair trade. \\"Now is the time to join together, through constant cooperation, strong institutions, shared sacrifice, and a global commitment to progress, to meet the challenges of the 21st century,\\" Obama declared at a dramatic sunset appearance that had all the trappings of a campaign rally. He promised a new style of international leadership that would involve close consultations with U.S. allies. \\"America has no better partner than Europe,\\" he said. Republican candidate John McCain suggested that Obama is getting ahead of the U.S. electorate. Poking fun at his Democratic rival's globe-trotting, McCain dined Thursday at a German restaurant in Columbus, Ohio. \\"I'd love to give a speech in Germany,\\" McCain said at Schmidt's Sausage Haus und Restaurant, where he had bratwurst with local business leaders. \\"But I'd much prefer to do it as president of the United States rather than as a candidate for president.\\" The Obama's Berlin audience stretched almost a mile from the Siegessaule, an ornate victory column commemorating German victories in 19th century wars, to the Brandenburg Gate, which divided East Berlin from West Berlin during the Cold War. The crowd dwarfed Obama's largest U.S. crowd, 75,000 May 18 in Oregon. Obama used the once bifurcated city as a symbol of the divisions he wants to overcome if elected president. He urged Europeans to take up \\"the burdens of global leadership,\\" borrowing themes from his campaign speeches. \\"People of Berlin — people of the world — this is our moment. This is our time,\\" Obama said. A once obscure member of the Illinois Legislature until he rocketed to national prominence after a speech at the Democratic National Convention four years ago, the 46-year-old, first-term senator was received respectfully by leaders from Afghanistan to Jerusalem to here. After hosting Obama to an intimate dinner at his private residence, Jordan's King Abdullah II personally chauffeured him to the airport in the royal Mercedes. Perhaps most significantly, Obama's 16-month timetable for withdrawing U.S. combat troops won a qualified endorsement from Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki through the government's spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh. Obama's appearance in Berlin drew such large throngs of curiosity seekers that city officials had to set up police lines around his hotel. \\"He reminds me of the Kennedys,\\" said Beth Woodward, an American who teaches the children of military personnel stationed in Europe. She took the train from Frankfurt to see Obama speak. Obama took a moment of his speech to indulge in a little flag-waving overseas. Though he said there's room for improvement in some aspects of the USA — promising to be a better and more open partner with foreign allies — Obama described himself as \\"a proud citizen of the United States\\" and told his audience \\"how much I love America.\\" Not all of Obama's listeners were won over. \\"I wasn't impressed,\\" said Berliner Gabriele Seye. \\"He is like all the Americans. They see America as the savior of the world.\\" Contributing: Jill Lawrence and David M. Jackson in Washington, D.C.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? ludicrous attempt","completion":"The phrase \\"ludicrous attempt\\" can be considered negative when assessing its connotation and potential inferences. To fully evaluate the phrase, it's crucial to break down the two primary words that make up the phrase: 1. Ludicrous - The word ludicrous has a negative connotation, as it is derived from the Latin word \\"ludicrus,\\" which means \\"sportive\\" or \\"intended for play.\\" In modern English, ludicrous is typically used to describe something that is so absurd, outrageous, or preposterous that it evokes a sense of amusement, disbelief, or sometimes a mixture of both. 2. Attempt - The second term, \\"attempt,\\" does not necessarily carry a positive or negative connotation when contextualized on its own. The word primarily describes an effort to achieve or accomplish something, whether it be a goal, task, or aspiration. As such, its connotation might change based on the results of the endeavor and whether or not it is perceived as being successful or unsuccessful. When combining these two words into the phrase \\"ludicrous attempt,\\" the negative characteristics of the term \\"ludicrous\\" tend to overshadow the neutrality of the word \\"attempt.\\" As a result, the phrase can generally be interpreted as a criticism or disapproval of someone's effort to achieve or accomplish something, often implying that their manner of pursuing or engaging in the task was either absurd, ridiculous, or lacking in logic. However, the precise meaning and degree of negativity attached to \\"ludicrous attempt\\" may depend on the context in which it is used. For instance, the phrase might be deployed in a lighthearted or joking manner when discussing a playful or harmless situation that resulted in failure. In such cases, the negativity present might be less harsh or severe and infused with a humorous or teasing tone. Conversely, \\"ludicrous attempt\\" may be employed to underscore the utter foolishness or irrationality of someone's actions, particularly when the stakes of the situation are high or the consequences dire. Ultimately, the degree of negativity attributed to the phrase \\"ludicrous attempt\\" will rely on the surrounding context, but in general, it leans towards a negative interpretation."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

H. W. Johns, owner of a New York City Supply Shop for roofers , was responsible for(...) the opening of that first mine. Mr. Johns was given a piece of asbestos which had been found in Italy. He experimented with the material and then showed its surprising powers to his customers. After putting on a pair of asbestos gloves, which looked much like ordinary work gloves, he took red-hot coals from the fireplace and played with them in his hands. How astonished the customers were to discover that he was not burned at all. You can well imagine that he had increasing business in asbestos roofing materials. However, because it was very expensive to transport (carry) them from Italy to the United States, Mr. Johns sent out a young scientist to seek a source nearer home. This young man found great vein , in the province of Quebec in Canada. Ever since 1881 Quebec has led the world in the production of this unusual mineral, which is made up of magnesium, silicon, iron, and oxygen. When it is mined, the asbestos is heavy, just as you would expect a mineral to be. When it is separated, a strange thing happens; the rock breaks down into fine, soft, soapy fibres .

Here is an article: WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats sparred on Thursday over whether a new report by the Justice Department’s inspector general about the botched gun-tracking case known as Operation Fast and Furious meant that it was time for lawmakers to start wrapping up their own investigation. Members of both parties on the House oversight committee, which has been deeply divided during a long inquiry into the matter, praised the 471-page report by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, as comprehensive and fair, even as each side sought vindication in different aspects of his findings. A major outstanding issue is a lawsuit by the House over a subpoena for internal Justice Department e-mails from 2011, after the operation had ended. President Obama asserted executive privilege over the documents. The chairman of the committee, Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, engineered a House vote this summer to cite Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. for contempt for refusing to turn over the materials. But the new report, released on Wednesday, quoted from the e-mails at length, and the Justice Department gave Congress more than 300 pages of material that it cited. “Although this report will not bring a complete end to the need for us to work with Justice to bring genuine reform to their process, it goes a long way toward that,” Mr. Issa said, adding, “Some materials contained in this report do help us because they are, in fact, many of the items that we wish we had received.” The ranking Democrat on the committee, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said the disclosures raised the possibility of resolving “any lingering issues without further conflict.” “With this action by the department,” he said, “I urge the committee to reconsider its position and settle the remnants of this dispute without resorting to unnecessary and costly litigation that nobody in this country wants.” But there were also signs of a continuing appetite by some Republicans to keep the investigation going. Several noted that the inspector general had not interviewed a handful of potential witnesses who did not work for the Justice Department. Operation Fast and Furious was an investigation from late 2009 to early 2011 into an Arizona-based gun-trafficking ring linked to a Mexican drug gang. During its course, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives used the tactic of gun-walking — not seizing illegal weapons in hopes of identifying more criminals and building a bigger case. In December 2010, two guns linked to the case were found after a shootout where a Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry, was killed. Over the past year, some Republicans and conservative media commentators have accused Mr. Holder and other senior Obama administration officials of orchestrating the gun-walking, saying they must be covering up their culpability. On Thursday, Democrats emphasized the inspector general’s conclusion that neither Mr. Holder nor other senior Justice Department officials had authorized the tactics in Operation Fast and Furious, which came to light after Agent Terry’s death. Instead, it found, the strategy was the handiwork of poorly supervised agents and prosecutors in Arizona who had used the same approach in a case during the George W. Bush administration. Republicans focused on the inspector general’s findings that wiretap applications for Operation Fast and Furious contained red flags that should have alerted the deputy assistant attorney general who approved them, Jason Weinstein, that agents might be refraining from seizing guns. The wiretap applications are not public records. Earlier this year, Mr. Issa claimed that the materials made clear that gun-walking was occurring, but Democrats who had also read them — including Mr. Holder — rejected that characterization. Mr. Weinstein resigned on Wednesday, portraying himself as having been unfairly made a scapegoat by the report.

This sentence states that there is a 20/20 segment that is less damaging to Ellis than the raw interview transcript. In other words, the raw interview transcript was more damaging to Ellis than this part of the 20/20 segment. Sentence 2: The interview portion of 20/20 was worse than this part is.

Currency exchange: How to get more for your downward dollars For Canadians travelling to the U.S., or to many other countries, there's no way around that falling Canadian dollar. But there are ways to save some money on your currency conversion. Three years ago, the Canadian and U.S. dollar were equal in value. The loonie has since fallen by nearly one-third. Options abound and it would be nice if there was a comparison-shopping website for currencies, but we didn't find one to recommend. Nilan Peiris, of TransferWise, a London-based online money-transfer company, says it's not easy for customers to find the best deal when it comes to money transfers. \\"It's almost impossible to figure out, as a consumer, if you're getting a good deal,\\" he says. Experts tell us, as a general rule, you will get the worst rates at currency booths in airports and train stations. It should cost less exchanging your Canadian dollars at your neighbourhood bank before leaving on your trip. But both the University of Toronto's Ambarish Chandra and Friedberg Mercantile Group's Michael Hart tell CBC News better rates exist elsewhere. \\"Banks do work to ensure that the rates they offer are competitive, and they can be better than other foreign exchange providers,\\" according to the Canadian Bankers Association. As a general rule, experts say you will get the worst rates at currency booths in airports and train stations. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press) Bank rates can be better, but they can also be worse. As with many purchases, it's \\"buyer beware.\\" Currency exchanges post rates for buying or selling a currency. Consumers want to exchange at a rate that's close to the midpoint of those buy-and-sell rates. Peiris refers to that mid-market rate as the only \\"real exchange rate.\\" So what's a consumer to do? Let's say your next-door neighbour has a relative who's just arrived from Europe and wants to convert Euros to Canadian dollars. Your neighbour, knowing you plan to soon leave for Europe, puts you in touch with her relative. If the two of you agree to make the exchange at the mid-market rate for the Euro and the dollar, you will both do better than you could at a bank or currency exchange. According to the Bank of Canada's rough estimate, the fee banks and other financial institutions charge consumers \\"is typically around four per cent of the amount being converted.\\" In the scenario above, both you and the neighbour's relative save that four per cent. Nilan Peiris is the vice-president of growth for TransferWise, a U.K.-based peer-to-peer online money transfer service. (TransferWise) That was the idea behind TransferWise. The company is currently improving their setup for transferring Canadian dollars, and by the end of March, Peiris says it will be cheap, easy and fast to transfer loonies into other major currencies using their website. TransferWise was started in 2011 by two friends who frequently travelled between the U.K. and Estonia: Kristo Kaarmann, a former management consultant, and Taavet Hinrikus, Skype's first employee. TransferWise does peer-to-peer money transfer, using the midpoint rate for the two currencies and charging a fee of about one per cent on transfers between 500 and 1,000 US, with the rate dropping slightly for larger amounts. The fee on a 50,000 transfer would be about 0.72 per cent. Peiris, the company's vice-president of growth, says TransferWire strives to be transparent with consumers. He views the rest of the industry as almost in collaboration \\"to obfuscate pricing and make it much more difficult for consumers to shop around.\\" If exchanging amounts over 5,000, U of T's Chandra recommends online currency exchanges. Chandra teaches business economics, with his current research focusing on travel and trade across the Canada-U.S. border. That includes websites like TransferWise, CanadianForex, XE Trade, NorthStar and Payline by International Currency Exchange. Ambarish Chandra, a business professor at the University of Toronto, says using your credit card for purchases in the U.S. will get you a slightly better rate than getting U.S. dollars at a bank. (Ken Jones/University of Toronto) In general, using these services requires some advance planning — the first time you use it, you will need to set up an account — and have bank accounts in both currencies. The exchange can take up to six business days but usually takes about three. You can pay off a foreign currency credit card this way, or use it to get cash, but that will require a visit to the bank. To get around not having the right foreign currency bank account, people sometimes have the money transferred to the account of a friend or relative where they will be travelling. In the trade, this is known as \\"using a friend as an ATM.\\" For most Canadian tourists going on short trips, most of the time Chandra advises using your credit card to make purchases in the U.S. and many other countries. Their exchange rate should be slightly better than the banks, he says. Expect to lose about 3.5 per cent using your credit card in the U.S., and more than four per cent in other countries. Frequent travellers can do even better using a U.S. dollar credit card, Chandra says. You may be able to get a card through a U.S. bank and some Canadian banks also offer U.S. credit cards, as well as U.S. dollar accounts. The key to saving is in how you pay that monthly credit card bill (and don't forget to check credit card fees). There are also credit cards available that don't charge foreign exchange transaction fees. Rogers Bank, from the telecom Rogers, offers one through MasterCard. Rogers says they don't add a 2.5-per-cent charge, the way the big banks do on their credit cards, and the exchange rate they use, for U.S. dollars at least, is the Bank of Canada's mid-market rate. The big bank credit cards use the MasterCard or Visa exchange rate, which costs the consumer another one per cent or so. Other credit cards that say they don't charge a foreign exchange fee include the Marriott Visa and Amazon Visa from Chase Canada. If you are travelling to a place where you have a friend or relative, you could do your currency exchange online and have the money sent to their bank account. You'll get a better rate and once you're there, they can easily withdraw the money. (Emrah Gurel/Associated Press) Chandra has another recommendation for a way to avoid foreign exchange fees. This method requires buying shares in an interlisted company on a Canadian stock exchange and then selling those shares on, say, a U.S. stock exchange. This method should get you U.S. dollars at the true mid-market rate, he says. He recommends this method for exchanging large sums and doing it through an online broker to keep the trade fees low. And of course, the stock price could go up or down in between your two trades. If you are trading large amounts, you can also negotiate a better rate than what the bank or exchange company posts, especially if you can prove other places are offering a better deal. While the loonie may be way down right now, Chandra advises against gaming the markets in hopes of getting a better rate. \\"It's not worth the trouble and the psychic costs of trying to look at the markets every day,\\" he says, adding that \\"you're very rarely going to win by a whole lot.\\" One of the best ways to save money on currency exchange is to pay with Canadian cash in the U.S. Despite the plunging loonie, some U.S. businesses still accept Canadian currency at par, although the number is dwindling. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"When traveling to another country, exchanging currency can be confusing and sometimes expensive. To get the best deal, try to exchange money at banks or online currency exchanges rather than at airports or train stations, and use credit cards when possible for slightly better rates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Finally, I'll ensure the translated sentence maintains the same meaning as the original Persian sentence. Translation: 1. و (and) = و 2. برخی (some) = بعض 3. بچه ‌ ها (children) = الأطفال 4. زمانیکه (when) = عندما 5. کمی بزرگتر (a little older) = أكبر قليلاً 6. می ‌ شوند (they become) = يصبحون 7. شروع به (begin to) = يبدأون في 8. دروغ گفتن (lying) = الكذب 9. می ‌ کنند (they do) = يفعلون (In this case, we do not need to have a separate verb for \\"they do\\" because the verb يبدأون already includes this meaning.) Now, I'll arrange the words in the correct Arabic order: و بعض الأطفال، عندما يصبحون أكبر قليلاً، يبدأون في الكذب.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What Republics did the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public, except on special occasions? , can you please find it? The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions. In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire. The tombs, chapel, exterior of Manjakamiadina and two traditional wooden houses (Besakana and Mahitsy) have since been restored with further restorations planned to continue until at least 2013.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that overcomes his prejudice? from the following article ? MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea. When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice. Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya.

A. negative; B. positive; TEXT:Some of the best movies that are categorized as \\"comedies\\" actually blur between comedy and drama. \\"The Graduate\\" and \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\", which were made also in the late 1960's are perfect examples. Are they comedies with dramatic undertones, or dramas with a lot of humor? In many respects, \\"The Odd Couple\\" falls into this same category of being both comedy yet highly dramatic with deep underpinnings about human nature. Much of what happens may be funny to the audience but the characters are not laughing. Despite the rather light-hearted TV show of the 1970's, the original \\"Odd Couple\\" is not merely about a neat guy and messy guy who are forced to live together because of their marital situation. It's really about two opposites who must face why their marriages fell apart and how their detrimental idiosyncrasies reveal themselves outside of their marriage. Neatness, the characteristic of Felix Ungar (Jack Lemon perfectly cast) and messiness, the characteristic of Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau), are only the beginning and somewhat superficial. As the story unfolds, we find there is a lot more to these men than simply neatness versus messiness. Briefly, the story is really about Felix Ungar, who has to face an impending divorce from his wife Francis, who we never meet but is an important character throughout the story. On the verge of suicide, Ungar goes to the only place he knows: the apartment of Oscar Madison where a group of poker buddies hang out every so often. We learn that Ungar is not only a member of this \\"poker club\\" but the group knows what's happening to him and try, in their inept way, to help out. Madison figures the best way to help Ungar is to let him move in with him until his suicidal tendencies wear off. Unfortunately for Madison, he doesn't know what he's getting himself into. Madison is a carefree happy-go-lucky if rather irresponsible slob who's refrigerator was last cleaned probably when Herbert Hoover was still in the White House. Madison's idea of serving snacks is grabbing moldy cheese and sticking them in between two pieces of bread, and then throwing the contents of a bag of chips on the table. On the other hand, he enjoys booze and women, in short having a good time. Ungar is not only altogether different, he is diametrically opposite. He is not only an obsessive neatness nut that finds more joy in disinfecting the apartment than meeting women but he knows more than most women do about cooking and fine eating. At one point, he calls his ex-wife, not to talk about reconciling, but to get her recipe for meatloaf. At another moment, Ungar was going to spend the rest of the evening cutting cabbage for coleslaw. When Madison seems unimpressed, Ungar finally confesses he was only doing it for his roommate because he can't stand coleslaw. Who is this guy? But he has another endearing trait: Felix is also a hypochondriac. He obsesses about his health to the point where he makes strange noises in public places claiming he's helping his sinuses. He seems to have every health condition in the book. And if they made up more, Felix would probably have them. Ultimately, he is overly self-absorbed. Running throughout the movie are references to marriage. At one point when Madison is trying to convince Ungar to move in, he says, \\"What do you want, a wedding ring?\\" But little does he know that it is not the neat guy who can't deal with the messy guy, but the other way around. Their friendship becomes an inadvertent hellish relationship. And the climax occurs when Oscar invites two lonely British sisters for a get-together with both comedic and tragic results. This is one of the best comedies of its type ever written and not to be missed, with superlative performances by Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon in roles that are hard to imagine better played by anyone else. It is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly lacking from most comedies being produced today.","completion":"B. positive"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Importance Foods that have similar carbohydrate content can differ in the amount they raise blood glucose. The effects of this property, called the glycemic index, on risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes are not well understood. Objective To determine the effect of glycemic index and amount of total dietary carbohydrate on risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized crossover-controlled feeding trial conducted in research units in academic medical centers, in which 163 overweight adults (systolic blood pressure, 120-159 mm Hg) were given 4 complete diets that contained all of their meals, snacks, and calorie-containing beverages, each for 5 weeks, and completed at least 2 study diets. The first participant was enrolled April 1, 2008; the last participant finished December 22, 2010. For any pair of the 4 diets, there were 135 to 150 participants contributing at least 1 primary outcome measure. Interventions (1) A high–glycemic index (65% on the glucose scale), high-carbohydrate diet (58% energy); (2) a low–glycemic index (40%), high-carbohydrate diet; (3) a high–glycemic index, low-carbohydrate diet (40% energy); and (4) a low–glycemic index, low-carbohydrate diet. Each diet was based on a healthful DASH-type diet. Main Outcomes and Measures The 5 primary outcomes were insulin sensitivity, determined from the areas under the curves of glucose and insulin levels during an oral glucose tolerance test; levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides; and systolic blood pressure. Results At high dietary carbohydrate content, the low– compared with high–glycemic index level decreased insulin sensitivity from 8.9 to 7.1 units (−20%, P = .002); increased LDL cholesterol from 139 to 147 mg/dL (6%, P ≤ .001); and did not affect levels of HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, or blood pressure. At low carbohydrate content, the low– compared with high–glycemic index level did not affect the outcomes except for decreasing triglycerides from 91 to 86 mg/dL (−5%, P = .02). In the primary diet contrast, the low–glycemic index, low-carbohydrate diet, compared with the high–glycemic index, high-carbohydrate diet, did not affect insulin sensitivity, systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, or HDL cholesterol but did lower triglycerides from 111 to 86 mg/dL (−23%, P ≤ .001). Conclusions and Relevance In this 5-week controlled feeding study, diets with low glycemic index of dietary carbohydrate, compared with high glycemic index of dietary carbohydrate, did not result in improvements in insulin sensitivity, lipid levels, or systolic blood pressure. In the context of an overall DASH-type diet, using glycemic index to select specific foods may not improve cardiovascular risk factors or insulin resistance. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00608049 ||||| If you generally eat a heart-healthy diet, then you might have one fewer factor to worry about: the \\"glycemic index\\" of the carbs you eat, new research suggests. In a new study, researchers looked at how people's health is affected by the types of carbs they eat, using one measure of carbohydrates called the glycemic index. This index is a number, between 1 and 100, that reflects how much a given carb raises your blood sugar levels. For example, carbs such as apples and oatmeal have a low glycemic index, meaning they raise blood sugar less than carbs with a higher glycemic index, such as white bread and corn flakes. The researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Harvard Medical School set out to examine whether healthy diets with a low glycemic index would provide more heart health benefits compared with similarly healthy diets that have a higher glycemic index. [5 Diets That Fight Diseases] The researchers gave special diets to 163 overweight men and women for five weeks, and tracked their blood pressure, cholesterol levels and sensitivity to insulin. The participants were on four different diets that all contained the same number of calories, but two were high in carbohydrates and two were low in carbohydrates. Among the two that were high in carbs, one had a high glycemic index and the other had a low index. Similarly, of the two diets that were low in carbs, one had a high glycemic index and the other had a low one. The results showed that the glycemic index of the diet didn't matter. The participants on diets with a low glycemic index did not have improvements in their insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels or blood pressure during the study, according to the findings published today (Dec. 16) in the journal JAMA. \\"We were really surprised,\\" says co-author Dr. Lawrence Appel, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins. \\"We did not detect any clear benefit of the low glycemic index diets on the major risk factors for heart disease, and we found no evidence of benefit for diabetes prevention.\\" All four diets in the study were based on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. The DASH diet is designed to help treat or prevent high blood pressure by reducing people's salt intake and including foods rich in nutrients that help lower blood pressure, such as potassium, calcium and magnesium. \\"The unexpected findings\\" of the study suggest that the concept of glycemic index is less important than previously thought,\\" Dr. Robert Eckel, a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado, wrote in an editorial accompanying the study. \\"These findings should therefore direct attention back to the importance of maintaining an overall heart-healthy lifestyle, including diet pattern,\\" he said. An overall heart-healthy lifestyle includes the basic rules that most people already know, Appel said. \\"Don't drink sugar-sweetened drinks. Try to eat fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Try to avoid sweets, salt and foods high in saturated and trans fats. People who follow these principles will reap the benefits,\\" he said. Email Bahar Gholipour.

Available choices: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","completion":"(C). no Based on the given premise, \\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz, agreed Tommy with a grin,\\" the hypothesis \\"Tommy frowned, refused and instead said he would stroll round to the Ritz\\" is not true. There are several key points to consider when analyzing this premise and comparing it to the hypothesis: 1. Tommy's emotions: In the premise, Tommy is described as grinning when he agrees to the idea of strolling to the Ritz. This indicates a positive emotion and an acceptance of the suggestion. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that Tommy frowned, which typically represents a negative emotion or disagreement. These two descriptions of emotions are contradicting, meaning the hypothesis is not consistent with the premise. 2. Tommy's response: In the premise, Tommy seems to be accepting the idea of going to the Ritz, as evidenced by his agreement with a grin. His response is consistent with the action of strolling to the Ritz. In contrast, the hypothesis suggests that Tommy initially refused before saying he would stroll to the Ritz. This narrative does not align with the premise, where Tommy appears to be in agreement from the beginning. 3. Tone and context: The overall tone of the premise is more positive and casual, with Tommy agreeing to the idea of going to the Ritz while grinning. The hypothesis changes the tone to a more negative and conflicting scenario, where he first refuses and then changes his mind to stroll around the Ritz. This shift in tone and context does not match the original premise. In conclusion, based on the analysis of the key points mentioned above, the hypothesis \\"Tommy frowned, refused and instead said he would stroll round to the Ritz\\" is not true when considering the given premise \\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz, agreed Tommy with a grin.\\" These situations are not consistent in terms of Tommy's emotions, his response, and the overall tone and context.

I partially agree with another reviewer who thought that it was a pretentious album because of all the orchestral arragements. I think that only 2 songs could be so labeled. But for an album to have songs like ELDORADO and Mr. Kingdom and many others, it is just impossible to give it a bad review. If you buy this album, I assure you you will not regret it. Some of the sounds are somewhat dated but, you will understand that the melodies and lirics are the work of masters and if you think about it, this is what matters the most. I would think that if a new, stripped down version of this album is made, it would definately become a bigger classic than it is now. This is the only reason why I dont give it a full 5 star rating. Then again, 4 stars is pretty good...dont you think? A:","completion":"The review presented would likely increase the chances of me buying the product. Below are the key points from the review that contribute to this decision: 1. The reviewer considers the record a classic and refers to it as \\"pure pop music at its best,\\" implying a high quality and enjoyable listening experience. 2. Their main criticism is that the album might be somewhat pretentious due to the orchestral arrangements, but they also mention that this only applies to two songs. 3. Despite this criticism, the reviewer highlights the strengths of specific songs such as \\"ELDORADO\\" and \\"Mr. Kingdom,\\" and states that it is \\"impossible to give it a bad review.\\" 4.

Lastly, the reviewer gives the album a rating of 4 stars out of 5, indicating a high level of overall satisfaction with the product. While the reviewer does point out some minor negatives, the overall tone of the review is positive and complimentary. Consequently, this review would increase the chances of me purchasing the product, as the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, and the reviewer's enthusiasm for the album is evident."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment. Would experiment A's hydroxide have smaller or larger surface area than experiment B's hydroxide? Hint: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur. Answer:","completion":"In this case, Experiment A's hydroxide (solid pellet) would have a smaller surface area than Experiment B's hydroxide (ground NaOH). As mentioned in the hint, when the solid pellet of NaOH is placed into the chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur. This is because there are fewer hydroxide ions exposed on the surface of the pellet, which can react with HCl molecules. However, when the NaOH is ground up into smaller pieces (as in Experiment B), the total surface area of the hydroxide greatly increases. This increased surface area allows more hydroxide ions to be exposed and available to react with the HCl gas, thus increasing the overall reaction rate. So, Experiment B's hydroxide has a larger surface area compared to Experiment A's hydroxide, leading to a faster reaction between NaOH and HCl gas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the sentiment of the following review? So I'm not gonna lie, I was COMPLETELY disappointed with the Encore. My BF and I have stayed at the Wynn twice before and absolutely loved it. Since we had stayed in the past we both have our Red Cards and receive the promotions that come with it in the mail every so often. The last promotion we received was for the Encore and was for 109/night King Suites with 50 resort credit for staying two nights or more. With my BF and two friends birthdays coming up in the month of September the four of us decided to get two suites and celebrate. For months I bragged to our friends about how amazing the Wynn was and that I bet the Encore will be even better. We waited anxiously during the long month between our booking and the actual trip. We get there and are greeted by a beautiful lobby, over the top and so out there it's almost tacky, but it blends together as posh and classy. We are greeted immediately by someone who tells us to please stand in a specific line, though I can't remember what line that was (it was a special line). We waited for quite some time when another person came over and said she could help us right away at another computer. So we provide the lady our info, she pulls up the reservation, 2 suites with one couple in each suite, she offers us the upgrade to the 56th floor for an additional 20-25 (which was odd because the last two trips to Wynn had upgrades on the house). So we take the upgrade, sign permission for the additional upgrade charge and go to our suites. The suites are beautiful. Love that the TV turns completely around so you can watch it in either the living space or the bed, comfy chase lounge, great detail throughout and, like the Wynn, a gorgeous bathroom. We had a room facing the strip south (beautiful) and our friends had a room facing the strip north and downtown. It started out wonderfully. So we put our orders in for in-room breakfast the next morning, down a couple drinks, and head for the buffet. We have been to the buffet numerous times, and it is our favorite on the strip. We made our friends fans as well. The trip goes to plan, loved the pool, loved the casino, in-room breakfast is always a treat. So here comes check out. We go down stairs and the line is insane. We're talking at least a 45 minute wait. So a gentleman comes by and asks if we would like to give him our room number and an email address and they will send our bill to us right away. I made it a point to ask him should there be discrepancies if we could call back for them to be resolved. He said of course, no problem. So 4 days later (which in Wynn language means \\"right away\\") we receive our bill. For 448 more than our original reservation. So I call billing immediately. They only work 8-3 Monday through Friday, which the receptionist called bankers hours. I want to work at that bank! So the next day I call billing and the girl proceeds to tell me that I signed for the additional 100 a night (which came to 400 all together, plus 48 for their 12% tax) in addition to the room up-sell and that in doing that I had agreed to paying 209 a night instead of 109. I nearly lost it. Her and I went round and round and finally she says, \\"Oh I see the problem, it's because additional people were staying in the room\\". There were two people in each room. I asked her \\"Do you really believe I'm going to take a vacation by myself and leave my partner at home?! The average person vacations with their other half.\\" She keeps repeating to me that this was the reason and that I had agreed to it at check in. I finally asked to speak to a supervisor who immediately knew what the problem was. See, when I made the reservation I asked for 2 rooms for 4 people. The computer supposedly took this as 2 rooms with 4 people in each. She admitted they were wrong and promised me it would be taken care of and I should see the new correct bill in a couple days. Now 10 days later, with no new bill and no activity on my credit card I call back the billing department. I speak to some guy who says he sees the notes in my portfolio to correct the bill, but that no action has been taken on it. I nearly lost it again. I began asking him questions and you could tell through his phone demeanor he was getting irritated that I wouldn't just let him get off the phone and get back to the laughing I could hear in the background. He finally says he'll have to look through the bills to see what he can do and he will get back to me this evening or tomorrow. No call tonight, have a feeling I won't get one tomorrow. I love the Wynn, I really do, but I'm sad to say this may have been my last trip there. They lost an incredibly loyal fan. I hope no one else has to go through the mismanagement of this resort like we did. Choices: (A). negative (B). positive","completion":"The sentiment of the review can be categorized as (A) negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with various aspects of their stay at the Encore, including issues with billing, customer service, and general disappointment after having high expectations from previous experiences at Wynn.

Mike (Matt Long), Shelby's ex-boyfriend, has a new girlfriend, Elizabeth (Jessica Stroup), and they are preparing to go to Mt. Bliss, Mike's hometown, because the football team is going to be retiring his jersey. Shelby has problems with the bank about the bowling alley she inherited when her mother died and still believes that she and Mike are still an item. After the football game Mike and Elizabeth decide to go to Shelby's bowling alley. When Shelby sees Mike she kisses him, but Mike tells her that he has a new girlfriend. Shelby befriends Elizabeth and after a few tequila shots, a drunk Elizabeth says she is going to meet Mike's parents after.

Wanting to give a good first impression to Mike's parents, Elizabeth decides to go to a motel and sleep her intoxication off, so gets driven to the nearest one from Mike's policeman cousin Billy. As she arrives at check-in, the man behind the counter tells her that there are not any rooms left because of the homecoming football games and the nearest motel is four miles away. Mike goes home to see his mother, who tells him that one of her friends said his new girlfriend got drunk at the alley. Mike tells her that since Elizabeth wanted to make a good impression, she decided to stay at a motel.

Which is this about? Reuters - Rolling the dice at a craps table orwagering a paycheck playing poker may not be the most rationaluse of money, but one casino operator is hoping investors willfind its stock a better bet.","completion":"This excerpt is about how a casino operator is trying to convince potential investors that investing in its stock would be a wiser and more rational decision compared to gambling at its casino tables. The underlying narrative focuses on the unpredictability associated with betting at games like craps and poker, which often results in loss of money, and presents the idea that investing in the casino's stock could be a more reliable way to generate returns. In casinos, the odds usually favor the house, which means that a majority of players - especially in games of chance like craps or poker - may end up losing money. Unlike these games, investing in the stock market, particularly in the shares of a specific company like the casino operator mentioned, could entail a more calculated approach by analyzing the company's financial statements, overall performance, and market position. The company is essentially arguing that despite offering gambling services, they understand the drawbacks of such activities for the average person. By promoting the idea that their stock represents a more secure investment, they aim to capture the attention of astute investors who might generally stay away from gambling. To further analyze the situation, we can break it down into several components: 1. Company background: The casino operator should be evaluated based on its past performance, target market, location, and growth potential. Additionally, exploring other aspects such as management efficiency, profitability, and debt levels can provide a clearer picture of its overall standing in the industry, which may contribute to the potential for stock appreciation. 2. Industry analysis: The outlook for the casino industry will play a vital role in assessing the company's future prospects. Factors such as local and global economic conditions, regulatory environments, competition, and industry growth rates should be taken into consideration. A favorable view of the industry can significantly support the argument that investing in the casino operator's stock can be rational and lucrative. 3. Psychological aspects: Gambling is well-known for stimulating emotions and releasing adrenaline, which doesn't always lead to rational decision-making. On the other hand, the process of investing in stocks requires thorough research and a more level-headed approach. This distinction is crucial in understanding why the company's management believes that investing in their stock would be a smarter financial choice compared to gambling. 4. Risk assessment: While investing in stocks carries inherent risks, it does offer the chance to diversify one's portfolio and potentially lower the overall level of risk. Conversely, gambling lacks the same opportunity for diversification and often results in even higher risks. Therefore, the company is aiming to convince potential investors that the purchase of their stock can be a less risky and more rational decision relative to gambling. In conclusion, the casino operator is attempting to appeal to potential investors by positioning its stock as a better and more rational use of money compared to gambling at their tables. By analyzing the company's background, assessing the industry's outlook, understanding the psychological factors at play, and evaluating the risk levels, one can determine the validity of this claim. Ultimately, it is essential for investors to approach investing in any stock, including that of a casino operator, with a proper understanding of the associated risks and potential rewards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below . Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D. Which electron would be closer to the nucleus, cat A or cat B? Answer:","completion":"Based on Bohr's model and the categories defined by Greg, Cat A represents an electron with higher energy, and Cat B represents an electron with lower energy. In Bohr's model, electrons with less energy are found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Consequently, Cat B (the electron with lower energy) would be closer to the nucleus than Cat A (the electron with higher energy)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Definition of sterling (n) Bing Dictionary British currency: the currency in pounds and pence used in the United Kingdom of sterling silver: made of sterling silver admirable: admirable or valuable Just wanted to make sure the definition I know did not change. They sure as hell dont do British currency. Unlike the definition, this place is not admirable or valuable. Yes they have certain meal deals that are good and cheap but the service or lack there of completely cancels out any specials they might have. I havnt even mentioned what I ended up getting and it was not good at all. So I get my player card downstairs and proceed to go up the escalator towards the cafe. Wait time to sit down was about 10 minutes which was not bad at all. Unfortunately everything went downhill from there. After getting our drinks from the drink person, we all knew what we wanted to get already without even having to look at the menu. After about 15 minutes, our server finally got around to taking our order. Originally I wanted to get the Half Rack of Ribs and 10 Hot Wings for 7.77 deal with player card but the lady said that was over and it was now Steak n Eggs for 9.99. That's stupid because just earlier one of my friends said that they saw the 7.77 deal advertisement on one of the cabs. Even still she would not honor it and acted like we were wasting her time. It was obvious that she did not like her job. The bad vibes I was getting from her almost made me want to get up and leave. So I ordered the Prime Rib special for 9.99 since I saw somebody receive their order earlier. From that point on it seemed forever for our orders to come out. When I got my order, it looked decent to begin with but when I took my first bite the meat was bland and luke warm like it had been sitting out. Dipping it in the au jus that came with it helped a little. The onion rings that came with it were already soggy. How does that happen when she just brought it out? The mashed potatoes tasted like card board. Fail. Besides the bad service and bad food, the main thing that really bothered me was the smoke factor. The whole time we were there in the cafe, all we smelled was cigarette smoke like a whole group of people were sitting next to us smoking one cigarette after another. In closing, to reiterate my experience in a nut shell, bad food, bad service, bad ventilation, and just overall failure in ambience.

In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms.

Information: - An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process. The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process. It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result. An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough. Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field. An inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure. - Charles II (29 May 1630 6 February 1685) was king of England, Scotland and Ireland. He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651, and king of England, Scotland and Ireland from the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 until his death. - A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state. In federations, \\"governor\\" may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal and largely ceremonial power, while others having a complete control over the entire government. - A Royal Commission is a major ad-hoc formal public inquiry into a defined issue in some monarchies. They have been held in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia. A Royal Commission is similar in function to a Commission of Enquiry (or Inquiry) found in other countries such as Ireland, South Africa, and Hong Kong. It has considerable powers, generally greater even than those of a judge but restricted to the terms of reference of the Commission. The Commission is created by the Head of State (the Sovereign, or his/her representative in the form of a Governor-General or Governor) on the advice of the Government and formally appointed by letters patent. In practiceunlike lesser forms of inquiryonce a Commission has started the government cannot stop it. Consequently, governments are usually very careful about framing the terms of reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - In the United States, a design patent is a form of legal protection granted to the ornamental design of a functional item. Design patents are a type of industrial design right. Ornamental designs of jewelry, furniture, beverage containers (Fig. 1) and computer icons are examples of objects that are covered by design patents. - Legal instrument is a legal term of art that is used for any formally executed written document that can be formally attributed to its author, records and formally expresses a legally enforceable act, process, or contractual duty, obligation, or right, and therefore evidences that act, process, or agreement. Examples include a certificate, deed, bond, contract, will, legislative act, notarial act, court writ or process, or any law passed by a competent legislative body in municipal (domestic) or international law. Many legal instruments were written \\"under seal\\" by affixing a wax or paper seal to the document in evidence of its legal execution and authenticity (which often removes the need for consideration in contract law); however, today many jurisdictions have done away with the requirement of documents being under seal in order to give them legal effect. - Clan Cunningham is a Scottish clan. On 18 December 2013, Sir John Christopher Foggo Montgomery Cunningham, Baronet of Corsehill, was recognised by Lord Lyon as clan chief, after the chiefship had been vacant for over 200 years. - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. - The Lord Chancellor of Scotland was a Great Officer of State in pre-Union Scotland. - A Scottish clan (from Gaelic \\"\\", \\"children\\") is a kinship group among the Scottish people. Clans give a sense of shared identity and descent to members, and in modern times have an official structure recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon, which regulates Scottish heraldry and coats of arms. Most clans have their own tartan patterns, usually dating from the 19th century, which members may incorporate into kilts or other clothing. - Under United States law, a patent is a right granted to the inventor of a (1) process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter, (2) that is new, useful, and non-obvious. A patent is the right to exclude others from using a new technology. Specifically, it is the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, inducing others to infringe, and/or offering a product specially adapted for practice of the patent. - A president is the leader of a country or a division or part of a country, typically a republic, a democracy, or a dictatorship. The title \\"president\\" is sometimes used by extension for leaders of other groups, including corporate entities and social groups. - A Commonwealth realm is a sovereign state that is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and shares the same person, currently Elizabeth II, as its head of state and reigning constitutional monarch, but retains a crown legally distinct from the other realms. As of 2017, there are 16 Commonwealth realms: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tuvalu, Barbados, Grenada, Solomon Islands, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, and the United Kingdom. - William Cunningham, 8th Earl of Glencairn (15751630) was a Scottish politician. - William Cunningham , 9th Earl of Glencairn ( 1610 -- 1664 ) , was a Scottish nobleman , Lord Chancellor of Scotland , and a cavalier . He was also the chief of Clan Cunningham . The eldest son of William Cunningham , 8th Earl of Glencairn , on 21 July 1637 this William obtained a ratification from King Charles 1st , under the Royal Sign Manual , of the original Glencairn Letters Patent of 1488 . He was sworn a member of the Privy Council of Scotland and in 1641 was appointed a Commissioner of the Treasury . - Cavalier first used by Roundheads as a term of abuse for the wealthier male Royalist supporters of King Charles I and his son Charles II of England during the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the Restoration (1642 c. 1679). It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time. Prince Rupert, commander of much of Charles I's cavalry, is often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier. - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use. - A monarch is the sovereign head of state in a monarchy. A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the state, or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Typically a monarch either personally inherits the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as \\"the throne\\" or \\"the crown\\") or is selected by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, acclamation or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns for life or until abdication. - In the United Kingdom, the Great Officers of State are traditional Crown ministers, who either inherit their positions or are appointed to exercise certain largely ceremonial functions or operate as part of the government. Separate Great Officers exist for England and Scotland, and formerly for Ireland. Many of the Great Officers became largely ceremonial because historically they were so influential that their powers had to be resumed by the Crown or dissipated. - A patent (or ) is a set of exclusive rights granted by a sovereign state to an inventor or assignee for a limited period of time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem and is a product or a process. Patents are a form of intellectual property.

Summarize this article: There are different materials that you can buy to strap and support your elbow. Either trainer’s tape or kinesiology tape or tubular bandages can help limit your range of motion that is causing you discomfort, reduce stress on the injured tissue, and may allow more blood to flow to the injured area. Trainer’s and kinesiology tape are often best for muscle injuries. The tape expands when you move, making the treatment comfortable and practical if you have an active lifestyle or continue to exercise. If you have sensitive skin, consider trying quick release medical tape, which combines the strength of trainer’s and kinesiology tapes with less chance of irritating the skin during wear or removal. Tubular medical bandages are wrapped around the affected area and then affixed with tape or a small fastener. This might also be a good option if you have sensitive skin. Tubular bandages are an especially good option for wrapping joints or even to cover tape. You can purchase trainer’s and kinesiology tape and bandages at many pharmacies, medical supply stores, and sports stores. Some larger retailers may also carry it. Consider trying to strap your elbow with duct tape, which is as supportive as trainer’s or kinesiology tape. Some professionals may recommend using black tape, as it can adhere better to sweaty skin. Purchase bandages to wrap, strap, and support your elbow. Bandages will support your elbow and they may also help to reduce any swelling you have. You can use most types of medical wrap bandages at pharmacies, medical supply stores, and even some sports stores. Make sure to buy a bandage that is long enough to wrap your elbow enough to support and immobilize it. You will need to purchase medical tape or pins to keep the bandage in place. Prepare your arm skin for taping or bandaging by washing and shaving it, if necessary. This can not only help remove dirt and debris, make the tape stick more effectively, but also may prevent any discomfort when you remove the tape or bandage. Wash away any oils, sweat or dirt that may be on your skin with a gentle cleanser and warm water. This can minimize the risk that the tape or bandage doesn’t adhere properly to your arm. Any type of mild soap can effectively clean your arm. Make sure to rinse or wipe off all of the soap. If you have chosen not to use an underwrap (see next step) or have a lot of hair on your arm, you may want to shave your arm. Shave with care to prevent cutting your skin and causing injury. If you prefer not to place the tape or bandage against your skin, place an underwrap between the tape and your skin. If you use an underwrap, be aware that it is not as effective as using tape only. You do not have to use an underwrap or skin adhesives with tape or bandages. Spray the skin adhesive and or apply the underwrap to the areas of your arm you plan to wrap. You can buy underwrap and skin adhesive at most pharmacies, medical supply stores and some sports stores. You may need to cut the tape before you wrap your elbow depending on whether you bought strips or a round of tape. Pre-cutting the tape can help ensure you use the right amount and prevent you from wasting any tape. Cut pieces of your tape to approximately the length of your forearm. You may also want some smaller pieces. Rounding the edges of the tape can make it easier to apply. If your tape has backing, remove it before application. Summary:","completion":"Various materials can be used to strap and support your elbow, including trainer's tape, kinesiology tape, and tubular bandages. These can limit range of motion, reduce stress on injured tissue, and increase blood flow to injured areas. They are particularly suitable for muscle injuries and can be found at pharmacies, medical supply stores, and sports stores. Preparing your arm for taping involves washing and possibly shaving the area to ensure proper adhesion. Using an underwrap between the tape and skin is optional and may be less effective than tape alone. Pre-cutting tape to the desired length can help avoid waste and make application easier."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: If your expression is not already set up like a fraction, rewrite it this way. This makes it easier to follow all the necessary steps when dividing by a square root. Remember that a fraction bar is also a division bar. For example, if you are calculating 144÷36{displaystyle {sqrt {144}}div {sqrt {36}}}, rewrite the problem like this: 14436{displaystyle {frac {sqrt {144}}{sqrt {36}}}}. If your problem has a square root in the numerator and denominator, you can place both radicands under one radical sign. (A radicand is a number under a radical, or square root, sign.) This will simplify the simplifying process. For example, 14436{displaystyle {frac {sqrt {144}}{sqrt {36}}}} can be rewritten as 14436{displaystyle {sqrt {frac {144}{36}}}}. Divide the numbers as you would any whole number. Make sure to place their quotient under a new radical sign. For example, 14436=4{displaystyle {frac {144}{36}}=4}, so 14436=4{displaystyle {sqrt {frac {144}{36}}}={sqrt {4}}}. , if necessary. If the radicand is a perfect square, or if one of its factors is a perfect square, you need to simplify the expression. A perfect square is the product of a whole number multiplied by itself. For example, 25 is a perfect square, since 5×5=25{displaystyle 5times 5=25}. For example, 4 is a perfect square, since 2×2=4{displaystyle 2times 2=4}. Thus:4{displaystyle {sqrt {4}}}=2×2{displaystyle ={sqrt {2times 2}}}=2{displaystyle =2}So, 14436=4=2{displaystyle {frac {sqrt {144}}{sqrt {36}}}={sqrt {4}}=2}.","completion":"Alright, let's imagine we are trying to divide two numbers inside those funny square root symbols. First, we need to write it like a fraction (one number on top and the other on the bottom). Now, instead of having the square root symbol on both numbers, we can put them together under one square root symbol. Then, we divide the numbers just like we would normally do. After that, if the new number we got is a special \\"perfect square\\" (like 4, because 2 times 2 is 4), we can simplify it even more. In our example, it was 4, and the square root of 4 is 2.

This movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the Coppola family. It doesn't seem to know whether to be an \\"A\\" or a \\"B\\" western. I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd must be spinning in his grave. All the \\"B\\" western cliches are here. The two-gun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed (\\"C'mon Thunder\\"), the all-in-black bearded villain, the heroine in distress, the rancher in trouble, the cowardly sheriff, over the top bad guys etc. The acting, with few exceptions, is strictly from the Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (who?) as the hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30's Poverty Row quickie. The addition to the cast of veteran performers Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a little, but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one. What was the point of the Martin Sheen/Robert Carradine framing sequences? Are we to believe that the Sheen character was a ghost? What was the purpose of the black gloves? It just didn't make sense. Being a great lover of westerns from all genres, I tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film. The cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic. Aside from the hero and main villain, the other characters looked authentic. If the producers were going to resurrect the Hopalong Cassidy character, they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written - a grizzled foul-mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder, the kind of part Lee Marvin would have excelled in.

Answer: An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson, using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West , failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861. Question: what happened on april 11 1861 at fort sumter The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the provided answer does not accurately describe what happened on April 11, 1861, at Fort Sumter, although it does reference an earlier event in the timeline leading up to the Battle of Fort Sumter. On January 9, 1861, the Star of the West, an unarmed merchant ship sent by President James Buchanan, was indeed fired upon, preventing it from reinforcing and resupplying Fort Sumter. On April 11, 1861, a significant series of events unfolded at Fort Sumter, culminating in the Battle of Fort Sumter, which marked the beginning of the American Civil War. The events leading up to this day included escalating tensions between the Northern and Southern states due to differing views on slavery, economic disparity, and states' rights. South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union on December 20, 1860, with six more states—Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas—joining it to form the Confederate States of America. In the early hours of April 11, 1861, Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard sent aides–Colonel James Chesnut, Jr., Captain Stephen D. Lee, and Lieutenant A.R. Chisolm–to Major Robert Anderson, the Union commander at Fort Sumter, to demand the fort's surrender. Anderson refused this demand, even though his small garrison of approximately 80 Union soldiers was running low on supplies and reinforcements. However, he did indicate that he would be forced to surrender within a few days if no supplies or reinforcements arrived. Later in the day, further negotiations were held between the Union and Confederate authorities. However, these negotiations proved unsuccessful, and General Beauregard received instructions from Confederate President Jefferson Davis to open fire on Fort Sumter if it had not surrendered by 4 a.m. on April 12, 1861. Thus, April 11, 1861, was a crucial day in the lead-up to the Battle of Fort Sumter, featuring failed negotiations and ultimatums that would ultimately ignite the American Civil War. The battle itself began in the early hours of April 12, when Confederate forces commenced their bombardment of the fort. After relentless shelling for more than 34 hours, Major Anderson and his Union forces surrendered Fort Sumter on April 13, 1861. The Battle of Fort Sumter marked the beginning of a long and bloody conflict that would last for four years, ultimately resulting in the deaths of more than 600,000 Americans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On September 1, 1939, the aerial bombardment of Warsaw and Invasion of Poland commences. Antonina and her son Ryszard (Timothy Radford and later, Val Maloku) barely survive. As Polish resistance collapses, Dr. Lutz Heck, head of the Berlin Zoo and Adolf Hitler's chief zoologist and Jan's professional rival, visits the zoo while Jan is away. He offers to house the prized animals until after the war, later returning with Nazi soldiers to shoot the rest. He develops a romantic interest in Antonina. The Jews of Warsaw are forced into the Ghetto. The Żabińskis' Jewish friends, Maurycy Fraenkel and his partner Magda Gross, seek a safe place for a friend's insect collection. Antonina offers to shelter Magda. Knowing they can be executed for helping Jews, Jan and Antonina decide to use the zoo to save more lives. They seek out Heck to propose turning the abandoned zoo into a pig farm to feed the German occupying forces, secretly hoping to bring food to the Ghetto. Heck, in need of a new site for his experiments in recreating Aurochs as a symbol of the Reich, agrees. Jan collects garbage from the Ghetto for the pigs and sees Jews starving.

Attorney Robert Shapiro noted Simpson didn't testify in his murder case, Pistorius will The mid-1990s murder trial of O. J. Simpson is different in several respects from the current murder trial of South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius, according to an attorney for Simpson in that trial, Robert Shapiro, right. (Photo: Vince Bucci, Associated Press) Story Highlights O.J. Simpson attorney Robert Shapiro downplayed police bungling in Oscar Pistorius case Simpson murder case trial by jury; Pistorius murder case to be decided by magistrate Shapiro says it will come down to whether magistrate believes Pistorius Robert Shapiro, who once represented O.J. Simpson in the notorious murder trial of the mid-1990s in Los Angeles, said the Oscar Pistorius murder case in South Africa is very different except that both \\"have superstar athletes that are accused of killing beautiful significant others.\\" In an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Shapiro responded to assertions that Pistorius is South Africa's version of Simpson, with both cases rife with accusations of police bungling. \\"I really don't think the detectives are really going to be much of an issue in this case,\\" Shapiro said, adding that he doesn't think forensics will be a key issue, either. \\"Pistorius is going to testify; Simpson did not.\\" The Simpson case was a classic, 'Who was responsible for the murder case?' The Pistorius case is a case of, 'What is it?' \\" Shapiro said. Pistorius has \\"admitted to doing the shooting so the question is going to be, 'Was it a premeditated murder or was it a justifiable homicide?' \\" STORY: Lead detective replaced in Pistorius case The case has had its shares of twists and turns. Thursday, it was revealed that chief investigator Hilton Botha is facing attempted murder charges stemming from a 2011 incident. Mark Fuhrman, the detective who led the investigation in the Simpson case, said charges filed against Botha and mistakes in his testimony don't matter. \\"So what?\\" Fuhrman told FoxNews.com. \\"The defense attorneys are doing what defense attorneys everywhere do,\\" Fuhrman said. \\"When you look at the facts, even omitting all the forensic evidence the police have produced, it's crystal clear. \\"Here is what he admits: 'I shot my girlfriend.' And he has to admit he fought with her in the past, because the police had been there previously. That's really all you need to know here.\\" Among the ways the defense has tried to discredit the prosecution's case is by noting an autopsy showed Reeva Steenkamp, Pistorius' girlfriend of three months, had a full bladder. The defense says that boosts Pistorius' claim that she had gone to use the toilet in the middle of the night. Iin an affadavit he says he shot her accidentally, mistaking her for an intruder. \\"I've got news for them: When you're dead, your bowels and bladder relax,\\" Fuhrman told FoxNews.com. How this case will be decided is the main difference between South Africa's legal system and the USA's, Shapiro said. Simpson had a trial by jury. A single judge will decide Pistorius' case. In South Africa, jury trials were abolished in the 1930s because of apartheid, Shapiro said. People could not get a fair trial because of the race relations that existed. \\"The judge (in the Pistorius case) is going to make one decision. He's not going to say, 'Do I have reasonable doubt?' \\" Shapiro said. \\"He's going to say, 'Do I believe what Mr. Pistorius is telling us? Do I believe that he actually felt that there was a burglar in the house? And that he reasonably believed that his life was in danger if he didn't take action and shoot through a closed door at an unknown target.' \\" ||||| Olympian Oscar Pistorius, known as 'Blade Runner' charged with killing model girlfriend Oscar Pistorius, an Olympian who was at one point an icon in South Africa whose lower legs were amputated when he was less than a year old, claims he mistook his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot her in a locked bathroom in his home. Prosecutors, however, say the couple had had a shouting match and Steenkamp fled to the bathroom, and locked herself in. Pistorius, 26, allegedly got up from bed and had to put on his prosthetic legs to reach the toilet door. The door was broken open after the shots were fired, prosecutors charge. Attorneys for Oscar Pistorius, the so-called Blade Runner, are poking headline-grabbing holes in the forensic evidence arrayed against the South African double amputee, but none of it changes facts that show the Olympic sprinter killed his model girlfriend, said former LAPD investigator and author Mark Fuhrman. The former lead detective in the Pistorius case is facing an attempted murder charge stemming from an on-duty incident, prosecutors may have been too quick to say steroids were found in the Pretoria mansion of the suspect and detectives missed a bullet lodged in the bathroom wall. “The defense attorneys are doing what defense attorneys everywhere do.” - Mark Fuhrman, author and former LAPD detective “So what?” says Fuhrman, who as a detective had a major role in the O.J. Simpson case and then went on to write several books analyzing the evidence in various high-profile murders. “The defense attorneys are doing what defense attorneys everywhere do,” Fuhrman said. “When you look at the facts, even omitting all the forensic evidence the police have produced, it’s crystal clear. “Here is what he admits: ‘I shot my girlfriend.’ And he has to admit he fought with her in the past, because the police had been there previously. That’s really all you need to know here.” Fuhrman dismissed the latest revelation that South African detective Hilton Botha is facing attempted murder charges in connection with a 2011 shooting incident. That case, which involved Botha and two other police officers who allegedly fired at a minibus they were trying to stop, was reopened 10 days before Pistorius’ girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp was killed, after new evidence surfaced. Botha was taken off the Blade Runner case on Thursday. “That wasn’t a shock,” Fuhrman said. “Any street cop knows you will be sued or involved in some type of litigation throughout your career. If the detective was compromised in any way, how does that change the actions of the suspect on the night in question?” Although Botha admitted under questioning that nothing at the crime scene was inconsistent with Pistorius’ explanation, Fuhrman said the evidence is a much better fit with the explanation that prosecutors have offered. Steenkamp, 29, was in a bathroom when she was shot four times through the door. Defense attorneys have sought to dispel the idea she was hiding from her enraged beau by noting her bladder was empty – suggesting she had gone to the room to use the toilet. Fuhrman scoffed at the explanation. “I’ve got news for them: When you’re dead, your bowels and bladder relax,” he said. Pistorius, 26, claims he awoke in the night and heard a noise in the bathroom and assumed it was an intruder, saying he felt a “sense of terror rushing over” him. “He knew there were two people in the house, he lives there, and she’s over,” Fuhrman said. “He hears something in the bathroom, and he doesn’t think it’s his girlfriend? He has an extensive security system that apparently has not been set off, yet he assumes the person behind the bathroom door is a burglar?” The defense has also disputed the “pre-meditated” aspect of the murder charge. But Fuhrman noted reports that a bloody cricket bat was found in the house, and Steenkamp had a blunt-force trauma wound to her head. The detective theorized that the pair fought, Pistorius bashed her over the head and she fled to the bathroom. If at that point, he went and got a gun and pursued her, pre-meditation applies. “Pre-meditation can form in split seconds,” he said. Botha may have made other errors at the crime scene, including missing a bullet that hit the toilet that was found by the defense's forensic team four days later. He also admitted on the stand that he did not wear protective clothing at the scene, which defense attorneys suggested could have contaminated evidence. Botha said police found testosterone and needles in a bedroom dresser, but Pistorius’ attorney said it was a herbal remedy. It was not clear when the compound would be tested. “Whether he was on steroids or not really has nothing to do with his defense, if he claims he thought he was shooting a burglar,” Fuhrman said. Finally, defense attorneys attacked Botha’s assertion that the trajectory of the bullets showed Pistorius’ 9-mm. handgun was fired downward from a height differs with the suspect’s claim he was not wearing his prosthetics at the time. Once again, Fuhrman said the defense was grasping at straws. “It doesn’t matter if he was on stumps or stilts,” Fuhrman said. “He already says he fired the shots.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Robert Shapiro, an attorney who represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial, commented on the Oscar Pistorius case, highlighting differences and similarities between the two high-profile trials involving superstar athletes. Shapiro downplayed the impact of police mistakes on the Pistorius trial and emphasized that Pistorius will testify, unlike Simpson. The case's outcome will depend on whether the magistrate believes Pistorius's account of thinking there was an intruder in his home, leading to the tragic shooting of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. The former lead detective in the Pistorius case, Mark Fuhrman, echoed Shapiro's views, stating that despite errors in the investigation, the facts of the case remain unchanged."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. I am facing a new situation today: Tom and Jerry were two 50-year-olds which went to high-school together. They recently met and discussed their health problems over coffee.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Either out of confusion or discomfort we sometimes express our feelings in an unclear way. One key to making your feelings clear is to realize that you most often can shorten them in a few words: hurt, glad, confused, excited, angry, and so on. In the same way, with a little thought you can probably describe very briefly any reasons you have for feeling a certain way. In addition to avoiding too long expressions, a second way to prevent confusion is to avoid _ your feelings by saying \\"I'm a little unhappy\\" or \\"I'm pretty excited\\". Of course, not all feelings are strong ones. We do feel degrees of sadness and joy, for example, but some communicators have a tendency to downplay almost every feeling. Do you? A third danger to avoid is expressing feelings in an indirect or coded manner. This happened most often when the sender is uncomfortable about showing his or her feeling in question. Some codes are verbal ones, as when the sender hints more or less subtly at the message. For example, an indirect way to say \\"I'm feeling lonely\\" might be \\"I guess there isn't much happening this weekend, so if you're not busy, why don't you drop by?\\" Such a message is so indirect that chances are small that your real feeling will be recognized. For this reason, people who send coded messages stand less of a chance of having their feeling understood and their need met. Finally, you can express yourself clearly by making sure that both you and your partner understand that your feeling is centered in a specific set of environments rather than being indicative of the whole relationship. Instead of saying \\"I hate you\\", say \\"I hate you when you don't keep your promises\\"'. Rather than \\"I'm bored with you\\", say \\"I'm bored when you talk about your money.\\" Answer:","completion":"Which of the following practices is NOT recommended in the article for expressing feelings clearly?

You deserve it And that dress looks abselutely stunning!","completion":"When describing the sentiment of this tweet, one can identify it as positive and supportive. To break it down, let's examine the various aspects of the tweet that contribute to its overall sentiment. 1. The tweet begins by tagging the user @mileycyrus, which indicates that the person is addressing Miley Cyrus directly. This direct address demonstrates engagement and attention towards the subject of the message. 2. The next part of the tweet is a URL (http://twitpic.com/6dvj4) that likely leads to an image or an event related to Miley Cyrus. While the content of the linked image cannot be determined from the context of the tweet alone, it is assumed that the user is referring to something positive based on the subsequent text in the tweet. 3. The user then congratulates Miley Cyrus by saying \\"Congratulations!\\" This further highlights a positive sentiment, as congratulations are typically given in response to an achievement or a milestone. 4. The user continues by stating, \\"You deserve it.\\" This phrase further bolsters the positive sentiment, as it implies that Miley Cyrus has earned or is worthy of the praise and congratulations. It is also a sign of encouragement, as the user acknowledges Miley Cyrus's hard work and achievement. 5. Finally, the user mentions Miley Cyrus's dress, stating, \\"And that dress looks absolutely stunning!\\" This compliment emphasizes a positive perception of Miley's appearance, specifically complimenting her fashion choice. The adjective \\"stunning\\" suggests that the dress is not only attractive but also has a strong and memorable impact. To sum up, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as positive and supportive, with the user congratulating Miley Cyrus on her achievements, acknowledging her worthiness, and complimenting her fashion choice. Such a tweet could likely lead to a sense of appreciation and validation for the subject, further strengthening the positive sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The White House has announced sanctions against 38 Russian individuals and companies, saying the United States is standing up to ongoing \\"malign activity\\" by the Russian government against Western democracies and around the world. At Friday's White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. still wants to work with Russia. \\"Again, what we would like to see is the totality of the Russian behavior change. We want to continue having conversations and work forward to building a better relationship,\\" Sanders said. The sanctions will be imposed on seven Russian oligarchs — including Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — and 12 companies they own or control. Seventeen senior Russian government officials, as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank, also will be targeted. The group includes key members of Putin's inner circle. Those sanctioned will have their assets blocked in the U.S. and people in the U.S. are barred from doing business with them. Friday, a number of U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy experts welcomed the measure, saying the sanctions are overdue. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the move is the strongest action taken by the Trump administration to date for Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and \\"its murder of dissidents at home and abroad.\\" \\"The sanctioning of oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska, who is linked to Paul Manafort, Alexander Torshin and Putin's son-in-law, will send a strong message to the Kremlin,\\" Schiff said in a statement. Florida's Marco Rubio, a Republican senator and former presidential candidate, also welcomed Friday's announcement. \\"These new sanctions send a clear message to Vladimir Putin that the illegal occupation of Ukraine, support for … war crimes [under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime], efforts to undermine Western democracies, and...

This question has options. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do you know an avocado is ready? Pick from: A). slice into it. B). squeeze it to see how squishy it is.","completion":"The correct answer is: B). squeeze it to see how squishy it is. Explanation: The best way to determine whether an avocado is ripe and ready to eat is by gently squeezing it. You want the avocado to yield slightly to your pressure while maintaining some firmness — that indicates its ripeness. Overly squishy avocados, on the other hand, could be overripe. Option A, slicing into the avocado, is ineffective and inefficient for a few reasons. First, repeatedly slicing into avocados to determine their ripeness is a waste of food — especially if they're not ripe. Second, slicing an underripe or overripe avocado could potentially make it more difficult to cut and remove the pit safely. So this method could result in unnecessary waste and potentially unsafe cutting conditions. On the other hand, giving the avocado a gentle squeeze is quick, easy, safe, and wastes no food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since we have -26 times the number of gold coins, we need to undo that by dividing both sides of the equation by -26: (-26*y) / -26 = -234 / -26 That gives us: y = 9 So, the number of gold coins (y) in our secret treasure chest is 9!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the dialogue, the man initially expresses his intention to read just one article, believing that it would be sufficient for the class.

Each article presents a unique viewpoint, and it is crucial to explore these differing perspectives to better understand the complexity of the topic they are studying. By encouraging the man to read more than just one article, the woman is essentially conveying the importance of expanding one's knowledge and not limiting oneself to a single source of information within the context of their political science class.

Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and...

The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of the Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.This bedroom is also less richly ornamented than many in the castle, making extensive use of plain, stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls.

In normal conditions, the dew point temperature will not be greater than the air temperature because relative humidity cannot exceed 100%.[4] Now, I have a new situation: Sam lived in Chicago for many years and experienced those high humidity days during the summer, the Indian summers in October and harsh and humid winters, so he decided to move to San Diego, in a warmer and much dryer climate. Answer this question please: Which city has more humidity during winter? A:","completion":"Chicago typically has higher humidity during winter compared to San Diego. Although San Diego experiences a more consistent and milder climate throughout the year, its winter months usually have lower humidity levels due to the influence of the Mediterranean climate and the relative dryness of Southern California. In contrast, Chicago experiences cold and harsh winters, with greater humidity levels because cold air can hold less water vapor. As temperature falls, relative humidity rises since less vapor is required to saturate the air, causing condensation to occur more frequently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That's the first step on our adventure: remove the outer shell from the fava beans. You can do this by taking off the pods, or outer part, so the hidden beans inside are free. Next, like a master wizard, you are going to make magic water. Fill a big pot with water and we are going to heat it up until it's boiling hot. It's like a bubbling potion! Now, ready for a short dive? Toss the fava beans into the hot water and only let them swim for 30 seconds. This is called parboiling, it means cooking them just a little bit. Using a handy little strainer or slotted spoon, help them out of the water. Be careful, the water will be hot! Next, guess what? Those fava beans have a second secret layer! Remove this outer coating to reveal the truly tasty treasure inside. Now, it’s time for those beans to get comfortable. Melt some butter in a pan over the heat, just until it's soft and liquid. Add some garlic, like adding tiny flavor nuggets. Let it sizzle and dance in the pan just a bit, this is called sautéing, it makes the wriggly beans and garlic taste even better. Then, add your fava beans to the party in the pan. They'll dance with the garlic in the melty butter until they can't wait to jump onto your plate! Finally, sprinkle on some seasonings like salt or pepper, whatever you like to make your beans even more yummy. And voila! You have completed your cooking adventure!

Instead, they reinvest any revenue they generate back into the organization to further its mission. The paragraph mentions that the PAACF supports the Palo Alto Art Center by providing various art-related activities in the city of Palo Alto, California. Since its founding in 1971, the Art Center has served as a community hub for artistic and cultural endeavors.

Write the answer: Matabeleland is part of which African country?","completion":"Matabeleland is a region located in the southwestern part of Zimbabwe, an African country situated in the southern portion of the continent. Zimbabwe is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. The name Matabeleland is derived from the Ndebele people, who inhabited the region before the colonization of Zimbabwe by the British. The Ndebele people, also known as the Matabele, are a Bantu ethnic group, and their language, Sindebele or Northern Ndebele, is one of the 16 official languages of Zimbabwe. Matabeleland is politically divided into three provinces: 1. Matabeleland North Province: This province is predominantly rural and has a wealth of natural resources, including the well-known Hwange National Park, which is the largest game reserve in Zimbabwe. It is also home to the Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, attracting thousands of tourists from around the globe. The provincial capital of Matabeleland North is Lupane. 2. Matabeleland South Province: This province is also mainly rural. It lies to the south of Matabeleland North Province, and its provincial capital is Gwanda. The Matopo (Matopos) National Park, located in this province, is known for its stunning landscapes and granite Kopjes, as well as its rich biodiversity. The park is also recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 3. Bulawayo Province: Bulawayo is the second-largest city in Zimbabwe, after the capital, Harare, and serves as the industrial and business center of Matabeleland. This city is known for its wide streets, well-planned infrastructure, and historical significance. Bulawayo is also the location of several important institutions, such as the National University of Science and Technology and the Bulawayo Railway Museum. Matabeleland has a diverse culture, as it is home to various ethnic groups. The region has experienced significant historical events, including the arrival of the Ndebele people, colonization by the British, and political turmoil during the Gukurahundi, a series of massacres committed in the 1980s to suppress perceived political dissent. In modern times, Matabeleland faces several challenges, including periodic droughts, limited economic opportunities, and developmental disparities in comparison to other regions of Zimbabwe. However, its vast natural resources, cultural heritage, and potential for ecotourism make Matabeleland a significant part of Zimbabwe's continued growth and future prospects."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The town is facing a unique, and troublesome issue – a massive bat infestation originating from a nearby cave system. As their numbers increase dramatically, the bats are becoming a threat to not only the town's residents and infrastructure but also to themselves, as the ecosystem can't sustain them any longer. Local residents have tried numerous ways to drive the bats away, only to be met with little to no success. Many in the town feel that the only solution left is to exterminate the entire bat population. Sheila, however, is determined to find a non-lethal solution that will restore order to both the town and the bats' habitat. Fueled by her passion for saving animal lives, Sheila starts working with a team of scientists and biologists to study the bats and their behavior. They learn that the bats have been drawn to the cave system due to the warmth provided by geothermal activity deep within the caves. Sheila hypothesizes that by significantly lowering the temperature in the caves, it could encourage the bats to migrate to another location while still preserving the environment for other cave-dwelling species. Sheila and her team collaborate with engineers to develop a system that would pump icy cold water from an underground river through pipes in the caves to reduce the temperature drastically. To prevent local residents from interfering, Sheila educates the town on the importance of safeguarding wildlife, convincing them that her plan will be the best solution. The town's mayor, initially a skeptic, begins to support Sheila's plan when he realizes the potential benefits of the plan for the town's tourism industry. As they work on the chilling project, Sheila and the team encounter several challenges – they must navigate tricky cave terrain, deal with equipment malfunctions, and battle against time as the bat population threatens to reach an unsustainably large number. At one point, their cold water system fails right when a group of bats is roosting near the cave entrance, almost causing a catastrophe. Fortunately, Sheila's determination and quick thinking avert disaster. In the end, Sheila's plan succeeds as the cave temperature drops significantly. The bats gradually leave the cave system, finding a new, more sustainable habitat farther away. Sheila and her team celebrate their victory over this environmental challenge, relieved they found a humane solution to the bat infestation. As life returns to normal in the town, Sheila's efforts to save the bats inspire other residents to advocate environmental conservation and respect wildlife. The story concludes with Sheila and the town starting a wildlife preservation organization that collaborates with neighboring communities to promote responsible coexistence between humans and animals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"How would bystanders feel as a result?\\", is \\"upset about the posters\\" a valid answer? Select from the following. (1). Yes. (2). No. The answer is:","completion":"(2). No. The answer is \\"No\\" because there is not enough information or context to directly conclude that bystanders would feel upset about the posters. It is important to consider various factors and potential reasons for people's reactions to such an occurrence. First and foremost, the context of the upcoming event advertised on the posters matters significantly. If the event consists of a controversial or offensive subject matter, then a negative reaction from some bystanders might be understandable. However, if the event is benign or widely appealing, there is less reason to assume that the posters would create negative emotions. Additionally, the design and presentation of the posters can have an impact on bystanders' reactions. A well-designed and visually appealing poster can elicit positive emotions, while a cluttered or unattractive poster might leave people feeling indifferent or even annoyed. However, these emotions may be directed towards the design of the poster rather than the actual content it promotes. Moreover, personal preferences and biases play a role in determining people's reactions. While some people might be interested in the event and appreciate the advertisement, others may not be interested in the subject matter or may be against the event for various reasons. As a result, their reactions may differ significantly. Furthermore, geographical and cultural context can also have an influence on the bystanders' feelings. For instance, people in a community that values and supports theater and arts events may show more enthusiasm and appreciation for the advertisement, while those from a region where such events are frowned upon may indeed feel upset about the posters. In summary, there is a multitude of factors that contribute to the reactions of bystanders when exposed to an advertisement for an upcoming event at the theater. Considering the context, design, personal preferences, and cultural background, it is difficult to directly conclude that bystanders would feel upset about the posters without examining these aspects.

Choices: [A]. negative [B]. positive The answer is:","completion":"[B]. positive The movie review sentence \\"to entertain\\" reflects a positive sentiment. This statement implies that the purpose of the movie is to provide amusement or enjoyment for the audience. The term \\"entertain\\" carries a positive connotation, as it is associated with enjoyment, fun, and receiving pleasure from a particular activity, in this case, watching a movie. When reviewers assess movies as entertaining, they generally mean that the film holds the viewers' attention and provides an enjoyable experience. An entertaining movie can take various forms, such as action-adventure films, comedies, dramas, or any other genre capable of offering an engaging experience. The use of the term \\"entertain\\" indicates that the movie can effectively keep the audience engaged and perhaps even evoke emotional responses or stimulate thought processes. In contrast, a negative movie review sentence would include terms that express displeasure, boredom, or dissatisfaction with the movie. For example, saying that the movie is \\"boring,\\" \\"dull,\\" or \\"tedious\\" implies the film failed to entertain or engage the viewer. Negative reviews often point out flaws or shortcomings, such as poor acting, weak plots, or lackluster technical aspects, which detract from the film's overall impact.

TalkBack makes navigating my device considerably easier, enabling me to browse the internet, read messages, and even make phone calls effortlessly despite my visual impairment. One thing that particularly impressed me is the customization features this app provides. I can easily adjust the speech volume, pitch, and rate to my preference, which contributes to a rather seamless experience. The gesture controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing me to flick and tap my way through various screens and tasks. However, I had to knock off a star because there are a few areas where there's room for improvement. For instance, the app occasionally misses announcing specific elements on the screen, which can be slightly confusing. I've also noticed that it can have difficulty properly distinguishing between certain buttons, especially those that are close together in some applications. Overall, I am quite happy with com.google.android.marvin.talkback, and I believe it's a fantastic aid for individuals with visual impairments.

Options: - train station - michigan - alaska - canada - countryside The answer is \\"canada\\" because The answer to this question is:","completion":"Canada because playing hockey on a frozen pond is a quintessential Canadian pastime that has deep cultural and historical roots in the country. While pond hockey may be played in other locations, such as Michigan or Alaska, it is most commonly associated with Canada due to several factors, which are as follows: 1. National sport: Hockey is considered Canada's national winter sport, and Canadians take great pride in their hockey heritage. It is a sport that is deeply ingrained in Canadian culture and identity. Many Canadians grow up playing pond hockey, learning the fundamentals of the sport on the frozen ponds and lakes during winter. 2. Climate: Canadian winters are known for their cold temperatures and thick layers of snow and ice. Many areas of Canada have naturally occurring frozen ponds, lakes, and rivers that provide ideal conditions for playing pond hockey. In contrast, in places like Alaska, while they may experience similar winter conditions, they do not have the same cultural history with hockey as Canada does. 3. Hockey development: Much of Canada's professional hockey talent has emerged from small towns and communities where children learn to play the sport on frozen ponds and lakes. This grassroots hockey development has given rise to many Canadian hockey legends and skilled players who have gone on to represent their country in international competitions, such as the Winter Olympics and the World Hockey Championships. 4. Community tradition: In many Canadian towns and cities, playing hockey on a frozen pond is a community tradition that brings together people of all ages. Locals in these areas often gather at the pond near train tracks or any other suitable location for friendly, casual games of pond hockey. These pick-up games serve as social events that promote camaraderie and shared experiences among community members. 5. Famous pond hockey tournament: Canada is home to the World Pond Hockey Championship, an annual event that takes place in Plaster Rock, New Brunswick. This tournament attracts teams from all over the world, showcasing the strong connection Canada has with pond hockey. Considering all these factors, playing hockey on a frozen pond near train tracks is a uniquely Canadian experience that resonates with the country's love for winter sports and its affinity for the great outdoors.

The man took the stairwell to the third floor instead of the elevator because the","completion":"elevator was out of order. He didn't mind climbing the stairs, as it was a good way to get some exercise, and with all the hours he spent sitting at his desk, he knew he needed it. When he had first moved into the building, he would often choose to save time by taking the elevator. But over the years, he had become more conscious of the sedentary lifestyle he led, and began to embrace the stairwell as an opportunity to make a small, but positive change in his daily routine. As he made his way up the stairs, he noticed the familiar patterns of wear on the steps, a testament to the countless footsteps that had traversed them over the years. The paint on the walls was faded and scratched in some spots, with shades of beige blending into a dull gray. He had always meant to ask the building management to freshen up the stairwell, but somehow it never felt like a priority amidst his busy schedule. Upon reaching the third floor, he paused for a moment to catch his breath. For some reason, the climb felt more challenging that day. He wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, making a mental note to start incorporating more cardio into his workouts. The stairwell was quiet aside from the occasional sound of footsteps from the floors above, reminding him that he wasn't the only one opting to bypass the out-of-order elevator. As the man continued down the dimly lit hallway, he observed the array of doors before him. Each apartment door had its own distinct characteristics - from the varied colors and door knockers to the personalized doormats that welcomed residents and visitors alike. He appreciated the subtle reminders that behind these uniform wood-panelled doors lay a diverse community of individuals, each with their own unique stories and experiences. Arriving at his own door, he unlocked it and stepped inside, momentarily pausing to appreciate the warmth and safety that his home provided. The comforting smell of fresh coffee wafted from the kitchen, a signal that his partner had already started their morning routine. Their shared life was punctuated by small, blissful moments like these, and he made a mental note to ensure that he expressed his gratitude more often. As he took off his jacket, hung his keys on the rack by the door, and moved further into the cozy apartment, he couldn't help but think of the broken elevator that had set this morning's events in motion. Although it was an inconvenience that most of his neighbors likely viewed as a headache, to him, it had served as an unexpected opportunity to pause, reflect, and appreciate the small details that often went unnoticed in the hustle and bustle of daily life. Resolving to continue cherishing these moments of stillness – and to avoid taking the ease of modern conveniences for granted – he decided that even once the elevator was repaired, he would maintain the habit of taking the stairs, valuing the chance to be more active and to observe the often-overlooked nooks and crannies of the building he called home. After all, it was in those quiet, unassuming places that he found the inspiration to make small, meaningful changes in his life. And it was those small, meaningful changes that ultimately brought him closer to the person he aspired to be."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible answers: (I). No (II). Yes I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what are the top three laws in science Suggested answer: I.e. \\"the laws of motion require that\\" Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the answer provided by the automatic system is not entirely accurate. The top three laws in science are not specifically about motion but rather about fundamental principles that govern various aspects of science. Though the suggested answer seems to refer to Newton's laws of motion, it does not provide clear or comprehensive information about the top three laws in science. To provide you with a more accurate response: some of the most widely recognized and significant laws in science include Newton's Laws of Motion (in Physics), the Laws of Thermodynamics (in Physics and Chemistry), and Mendelian Inheritance Laws (in Biology). However, it is important to note that many other scientific laws exist, and their significance and impact may vary depending on the field of study. Here, we can explore each of the mentioned laws briefly: 1. Newton's Laws of Motion - Sir Isaac Newton developed these three laws in the late 17th century, and they provide a foundation to classical mechanics. The three laws are: a. First Law (Law of Inertia) - An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion continues in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. b. Second Law (Law of Acceleration) - The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma). c. Third Law (Law of Action and Reaction) - For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 2. Laws of Thermodynamics - These laws express the relationship between heat, work, and energy in physical systems. There are four laws: a. Zeroth Law - If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. b. First Law (Law of Energy Conservation) - Energy cannot be created nor destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another. c. Second Law - In any energy transfer or transformation, the total entropy of a closed system will always increase over time. d. Third Law - The entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero. 3. Mendelian Inheritance Laws - Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, discovered these laws in the 19th century while studying pea plants. These laws laid the foundation for modern genetics and describe how traits are passed from parents to offspring. The three laws are: a. Law of Segregation - Each inherited trait is determined by a pair of genes; during reproduction, an individual contributes only one of these genes to its offspring. b. Law of Independent Assortment - The inheritance of one trait does not affect the inheritance of another trait. c. Law of Dominance - If an organism inherits a dominant and a recessive allele for a specific gene, the dominant allele will be expressed. In conclusion, while the initially suggested answer had some relevance to important scientific laws, it is necessary to comprehend the broader scope and details of the top laws in science. The laws mentioned above are some of the most influential, but it is essential to remember the vast diversity of scientific laws that exist across different disciplines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Steve Sansweet, owner of Rancho Obi-Wan in California, asks collectors and fans to help recover items allegedly stolen by his friend of 20 years The owner of the world’s largest Star Wars memorabilia collection has learned a hard lesson about trust. On Monday, he told his own saga in which 200,000 in collectibles were allegedly stolen from his California museum by a man he once considered a friend – and asked fellow movie fans for help in recovering them. In a warehouse far, far away, the galaxy's top Star Wars collector holds court Read more Steve Sansweet, the owner of Rancho Obi-Wan in Petaluma, California, said in a release to “Star Wars fans and collectors” that 100 items, which he referred to as “vintage US and foreign carded action figures, many of them rare and important pieces”, were taken from his collection between late 2015 through 2016, many of them resold. He posted details of the crime on his website and asked fellow collectors and fans to email tips@ranchoobiwan.org with information. The alleged culprit: Carl Edward Cunningham, 45 of Marietta, Georgia, a fellow Star Wars collector whom Sansweet has known for 20 years. Cunningham was arrested in March in Sonoma County, California, and charged with felony grand theft. He is free on 25,000 bail and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for 27 June. “It’s devastating,” Sansweet told the Guardian on Monday about when he learned a friend was charged with the thefts. “It’s a feeling of utter betrayal that someone could stoop to this level, an alleged friend and confidant, someone I had invited to my house and shared meals with.” Sansweet said he met Cunningham in 1996, while the museum proprietor was head of fan relations at Lucasfilm. Since 1977, Sansweet has accumulated at least 350,000 franchise artifacts, stored inside a 9,000-sq-ft warehouse he calls Rancho Obi-Wan, located on a idyllic country lane an hour north of San Francisco. He has also written 18 Star Wars books and is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as owning the world’s largest collection of Star Wars paraphernalia. The theft came to light in February when Philip Wise, a major Star Wars collector, posted news of the theft of a rare action figure from his Texas warehouse. Another dealer from southern California informed Wise that he had purchased the figure from Cunningham, a Georgia collector, Sansweet wrote in his release to movie fans Monday. Meet the super-collectors: ‘I wish I had Geri’s union jack dress’ Read more The California dealer, Zach Tann, told Wise that he had bought many other Star Wars collectibles from Cunningham and sent a detailed list. Wise concluded that the quantity and quality of the items suggested they had been taken from Sansweet’s sprawling Ranch Obi-Wan museum. He contacted Sansweet who confirmed that the items were missing, including a rare three-pack of figures and a store display worth 20,000. “When I saw the items missing, and considering the circumstances of the theft, my stomach physically sank,” Sansweet said. “I was queasy. I was dumbfounded,” Sansweet said authorities were trying to retrieve items that had been resold and implored Star Wars fans to report anything they knew about the thefts or sightings of the items. He said two fans have contacted authorities to say they bought some of the items from a legitimate dealer and have offered to return them, even if they do not get their money back. Actor Mark Hamill, who played the character Luke Skywalker in the film franchise, tweeted Monday about the theft, saying: “Maybe publish a list of stolen items to protect potential victims from purchasing ‘hot’ merchandise.” Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) Maybe publish a list of stolen items to protect potential victims from purchasing \\"hot\\" merchandise. #TheFraudIsStrongInThisOne #SithHappens https://t.co/coFv1P6HL7 Sansweet said the thefts ran contrary to the collegial spirit of Star Wars fans. “We’ve had thousands of visitors since we became a nonprofit museum in 2011,” he said. “And never once to our knowledge have we had a single item stolen.” Sansweet said the museum had already upgraded security, but he refused to say that his trust in friendship had been ruined. “The message here is not to start mistrusting your friends,” he said. “Or you’d be the most miserable person in the world.” ||||| This morning, the man who owns, displays, and offers tours of the world’s largest privately-owned Star Wars collection announced that he’s been systematically robbed over the past several months. Steve Sansweet—a prolific Star Wars author and collector, and the proprietor of Rancho Obi-Wan in Northern California—posted that over 100 items from his collection have been stolen, “the majority of them vintage U.S. and foreign carded action figures, many of them rare and important pieces.” Reportedly, several of those pieces have already been “resold or professionally appraised for a total of more than 200,000.” Advertisement According to Sansweet, the thefts were discovered when the sale of an ultra-rare Boba Fett action figure was tracked from its buyer to a man named Carl Edward Cunningham. Cunningham, whom Sansweet refers to as “a good and trusted friend,” surrendered to police at the end of March but is currently out on bail pending additional hearings. The Rancho Obi-Wan site is urging any fans who have found themselves in possession of any too-good-to-be-true vintage Star Wars collectibles that may have been stolen by Cunningham to contact them to figure out if it’s one of the pieces in question. “This has been a devastating betrayal from someone I considered a friend for 20 years,” Sansweet told io9. “But already the Star Wars community has offered its support and two of the purchasers have said they are returning the stolen items that they bought.” Advertisement All of the pilfered items were on display as part of Sansweet’s collection at Rancho Obi-Wan, which is run as a non-profit organization; proceeds from tours are donated to various charities. For more on this story, and information on how to contact the organization, visit the below link. [Rancho Obi-Wan] Update: We added the statement from Sansweet. ||||| Dear fellow Star Wars fans and collectors, I need to share some distressing news with you because I need your help. In February we at Rancho Obi-Wan found out that we had been the victim of a major theft that surreptitiously took place over many months in late 2015 through 2016. There were more than 100 valuable items stolen, the majority of them vintage U.S. and foreign carded action figures, many of them rare and important pieces. Most have either been resold or professionally appraised for a total of more than 200,000. The theft came to light after Philip Wise, a good friend, major collector and owner of several Star Wars websites, posted news of the theft of his rare prototype rocket-firing Boba Fett action figure from his Texas warehouse. Zach Tann, a respected toy dealer and collector in Southern California, immediately notified Philip that he had purchased that figure from Carl Edward Cunningham, 45, a well-known Star Wars collector and R2-D2 builder from Marietta, Georgia. Tann further told Philip that he previously had bought many other rare Star Wars collectibles from Carl and sent a detailed list. Philip said that he quickly concluded by the quantity and quality of items that they had likely been stolen from my collection here in Petaluma, California. Tann is working closely with us and authorities to help recover and return as many of the stolen collectibles as possible. Without Zach Tann’s call to Philip, which came despite great potential personal financial exposure to himself, we might still not know of the theft or its extent. Carl surrendered on an arrest warrant from the Sonoma County, California Sheriff’s Department at the end of March and was charged with felony grand theft. He is currently free on bail with additional hearings in the case scheduled. I have known Carl for many years, considered him a good and trusted friend, and played host to him at my home numerous times. I, and the staff at Rancho Obi-Wan, are devastated that he is the alleged perpetrator of the thefts. Not only have important items been stolen from the collection, but also our time, energy and ability to trust unconditionally have taken a blow. If you have any information about Carl Cunningham’s activities or items that he has sold please write to tips@ranchoobiwan.org. If you think you may have purchased a stolen item, please be patient while we work through this process. It is our goal to resolve this situation as quickly as possible and to continue to use the collection at Rancho Obi-Wan to “Inspire through the Force” despite the destruction caused by one person.

In this day and age players are aware of their power and if they want to sulk they are well capable of it. \\"I'm inclined to believe Roberto Mancini's version of events. Now Tevez is doing a damage limitation exercise because of the backlash he has received and all he is worried about is his image. \\"It would be fantastic if the club owners told Tevez he had to see out the rest of his contract in the reserves but it will be interesting to see if they have the bottle to do it.\\" Former Manchester City player Francis Lee told BBC Radio 5 live: \\"It is a severe breach of your contract and what you are supposed to do for the football club, I just can't believe it. \\"The world of football is full of big stars but, to my knowledge, none of them have ever done something like this before. \\"This was done with some reason relating to his wanting to get away for the club because if you refuse to play you are well on your way to going. \\"You have done it to your team-mates.

The club has bent over backwards for him, going back to the beginning of 2010 when we gave him compassionate leave and lost vital games at that time. \\"I think he has to go where we can get the money for him, I don't think we should do a cut-price deal or a loan deal.\\" toffeedaz on Phil McNulty's blog: \\"Millions of professional people have to deal with personal issues away from work, but they put them to one side when the boss asks them to put in their shift. \\"Professionals aren't paid because they can do a job.

The Guardian football writer Daniel Taylor: \\"This is a man who craves recognition as the biggest fish in his pond. And this season, at City, he has merely been part of the shoal.\\" FrontRow Legal specialist sports lawyer Richard Cramer speaking to BBC Sport: \\"Mancini has come out and said he will never pay for this club again. That in itself could be regarded as breach of contract on the part of Manchester City. \\"It is called a repudiatory breach - to say to a player that you will never play for this club again effectively deprives the player of the opportunity to carry out his work. \\"In hindsight Mancini would be better saying absolutely nothing and taking the appropriate disciplinary action against Tevez that would have been a two-week fine and a suspension. \\"There is a set procedure within a player's contract, usually consisting of a written warning, then a final written warning and then the last resort of dismissing a player. In exchange for a contract reportedly worth £250,000-a-week, the very least City should expect from Tevez is an agreement to play for the team and their supporters when requested by the manager Read more in Phil's blog \\"What we don't know is if Tevez is subject to ongoing disciplinary proceedings. But, if it is true that he refused to play yesterday, that borders on gross misconduct which would entitle City to sack him. \\"If they find that Tevez's act is beyond the realms of those of a normal player, City may just be able to construct a case against Tevez claiming he is deliberately putting himself in breach of contract, forcing the club to dismiss him for gross misconduct and that entitles them to recover some of the losses. \\"But that is unusual. If City want some compensation for him the best way to pursue that would be to sell him in the January window at the market value.\\" Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP Employment law partner at Peter Holt: \\"The fundamental issue here is whether Tevez, by refusing to do what he was employed to do and play football - does that constitute a fundamental breach of contract? \\"If it is a breach of contract, as an employer City have the option of terminating Tevez's contract with immediate effect. \\"One option they may want to consider is to follow the route that Chelsea took when they cancelled Adrian Mutu's contract. \\"Mutu made his way to Italy and ended up playing for Fiorentina. Chelsea then sued Mutu for compensation for the loss of the sell-on transfer value i.e. the transfer fee they would have received had it not been for his breach of contract. \\"The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld Chelsea's claim and Mutu was ultimately ordered to pay Chelsea 17m euros [£11.5m at the time] for breach of contract. \\"Whether that caluation would apply to Tevez is another matter.\\" Summary:","completion":"Premier League managers, former players, and fans weigh in on the Tevez dispute, discussing its impact on his future and the consequences of his actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters.

Context: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. Question: What did the engineer think about Fergus?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. There is bound to be ambiguous interpretation of the Commandments, which will result in student confusion and diminish the intended impact on children's morals. Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"There is indeed a possibility that the ambiguous interpretation of the Commandments can result in student confusion and diminish their intended impact on children's morals. Here's some evidence to support this claim: 1. Language Ambiguity: The language in which the Commandments are written can be quite archaic and hard to understand for modern students. This can lead to misinterpretation and confusion about the intended meaning or moral lesson behind each commandment. Also, translations of the Commandments from their original language might not capture the true essence of the original text, leading to further confusion. 2. Cultural and Contextual Differences: The Commandments were written in a specific cultural and historical context, which might not align with the present-day experiences and beliefs of students. For example, certain commandments reference elements of society or actions that might no longer be relevant or relatable to children today. This gap in understanding can lead to confusion and decrease the moral impact of these teachings on students. 3. Multiple Interpretations: Since the Commandments are open to interpretation, different individuals, religious groups, and cultural traditions have developed their own unique understandings of these teachings. This diversity in interpretation can lead to confusion among students, as they might encounter multiple viewpoints surrounding the same moral lesson, making it difficult for them to figure out which interpretation to adhere to or incorporate into their understanding of morality. 4. Lack of Clarity: Some commandments lack comprehensive definitions or explanations, which can lead to ambiguous interpretations of these teachings. For instance, the commandment \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" can raise questions about whether it's acceptable to kill in self-defense, during a war, or if it applies to animals as well. The lack of clarity in these commandments can lead to varied and confusing interpretations among students. 5. Conflicting Norms in Society: Society today often sends conflicting messages about morality and what's right or wrong. Exposure to mixed norms in media, online platforms, and peer groups can confuse children about the true meaning of the Commandments and their Implementation in daily life. This confusion might result in diminished moral impact on students, as they struggle to navigate conflicting messages and values. 6. Moral Relativism: In today's increasingly pluralistic and globalized society, many individuals subscribe to the idea of moral relativism, or the belief that there's no absolute moral truth and that morals vary between individuals and societies. This belief can make the interpretation of commandments even more ambiguous, as students might question the validity and universality of the moral lessons derived from these Commandments. To sum up, the ambiguous interpretation of the Commandments can indeed lead to student confusion and potentially diminish the intended impact on children's morals. Factors like language ambiguity, cultural differences, multiple interpretations, lack of clarity, conflicting societal norms, and the rise in moral relativism all contribute to this confusion and impact the moral development of children navigating these ancient teachings in the modern world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael John Harrison (born 26 July 1945), known for publication purposes primarily as M. John Harrison, is an English author and literary critic. His work includes the Viriconium sequence of novels and short stories (1971-1984), Climbers (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of Light (2002), Nova Swing (2006) and Empty Space (2012). He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \\"genre contrarian\\". The Times Literary Supplement described him as 'a singular stylist' and the Literary Review called him 'a witty and truly imaginative writer'. Harrison's enduring fantasy sequence concerning the fictitious city of Viriconium consists of three novels and various short stories and novels written between 1971 and 1984. Viriconium is known as the Pastel City. Both universal and particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium'. The first book, The Pastel City (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with the advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. The more complex second novel is A Storm of Wings (1982). It is set eighty years later than The Pastel City. and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Harrison brilliantly depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer. The third novel, In Viriconium (1982) (US title: The Floating Gods), was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague. Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, In Viriconium goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair. The short story \\"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\\" (1985; later retitled \\"A Young Man's Journey to London\\") is set in our world. It explains that Viriconium can be visited via a mirror in a bathroom in a cafe in England.","completion":"This text is about M.

News article: A novel twist on space launches In October, a small team of rocket scientists gathered in the middle of the Mojave Desert to watch a launch they hoped would help change space flight forever. Poised in front of them on the flat, open pan was a slender, 7.5-m (25-ft) tall, Garvey Prospector P-15 sounding rocket. To the untrained eye, the rocket was nothing special. But inside was a radical new engine technology that promises to cut the size, weight and therefore the cost of putting a rocket – and payload – into space. When the countdown clock ticked zero, the rocket fizzed into a roar and rose rapidly from its launch pad; its blazing engine pushing the rocket to 270 m/s (600 mph). After 30 seconds, the engine cut out and the first of the rocket’s red parachutes popped from their casing. The flight test was a success. For the crew from Orbital Technologies Corp (Orbitec) that built the test motor, it was another step in its decade-plus-long journey to prove its technology and show it to be an attractive alternative to a technology that’s been around since the birth of rocketry and one that is still used in most big rockets today. “Orbitec is ready and excited to compete for any future rocket engine and propulsion application,” Paul Zamprelli, business director at the firm said at the time. He and his colleagues believe that their “game-changing technology” could have a major impact on lowering the cost of space access. “We look forward to supplying the Air Force, Nasa and commercial markets with all of our affordable advanced engines and technologies.” To understand why Orbitec’s engines are different, you must first understand how larger liquid-fuel rocket engines – the ones that power astronauts and satellites into orbit – work. At their most basic these rockets have a combustion chamber that’s fed by two pressurised tanks – one of a rocket fuel and one of an oxidiser. When these two are forced into the chamber they mix, ignite and the exhausts are sent at high speed through a nozzle at the end of the rocket, propelling it forward. At full thrust, these engines get incredibly hot, reaching temperatures upwards of 3,000C (5,400F) or more, hot enough to melt the metal chamber in which the rocket fuel mixes with oxygen and burns. At these extremes, even rockets with sidewalls made of heat-resistant superalloys would fail catastrophically. To solve this problem, rocket scientists usually incorporate vein-like networks of cooling tubes through the sides of the combustion chamber which contain heat-absorbing liquid fuels that carry off excess thermal energy. The arrangement is like a car’s radiator system with internal coolant ducts arrayed around the outside of the engine core. It is only through this so-called \\"regenerative cooling\\" system that the rocket is able to maintain its structural integrity. Although the system works it adds considerable weight, cost and complexity to the engine. Orbitec’s alternative approach keeps the hot burning gases away from the chamber surfaces altogether. The company’s patented designs create a cyclonic swirl, or vortex, of fuel and oxygen that holds the searing gases and fumes in the very centre of the cylindrical combustion chamber, away from the vulnerable sidewalls. “Our vortex generator eliminates the high temperatures at the inner surfaces of the engine,” says Martin Chiaverini, principal propulsion engineer at the firm. “You can touch the exterior during lab-test firings and not get burned.” The vortex, or swirl, is produced by placing the oxidiser nozzles at the base of the combustion chamber and aiming them tangentially to the inner surface of its curving walls. This produces an outer vortex of cool gases that spiral up the walls forming a protective, cooling barrier. When this meets the top of the chamber it is mixed with rocket fuel and forced inward and down, forming a second, inner, descending vortex in the centre of the chamber that is concentrated like a tornado. The escaping downward stream of hot, high-pressure gases are then forced through the nozzle at the back of the chamber, producing thrust.

As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album.

Moyes also stated his belief that Rooney would not be recovered in time to join up with his England colleagues ahead of the qualifying double-header against Moldova and Ukraine. Rooney posted a picture of his injury on his official Facebook page on Wednesday evening with a comment defending his decision to withdraw from the crucial fixtures: (WARNING: To view the graphic image, click here). \\"Some people seem to be questioning my commitment to the England squad and the fact I had to pull out of the 2 games,\\" he wrote. \\"There's nothing I would like more than to be helping the lads in the qualifiers.

Reports: Chicago police officer to be charged with murder of black teen shot 16 times A white Chicago police officer is expected to be charged with murder in the 2014 shooting death of an African American teenager caught on dash-cam video, individuals close to the investigation told the Associated Press, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times Monday night. Unnamed officials told the news organizations that Officer Jason Van Dyke is expected to appear at a bond hearing at noon Tuesday at which time he is also expected to be charged with murder. His lawyer has said that the officer’s actions were lawful. “He believed in his heart of hearts that he was in fear for his life … he was concerned about the lives of [other] police officers,” Daniel Herbert told reporters last week. If Van Dyke is indicted, the case will mark the first time a Chicago police officer has been charged with first-degree murder for an on-duty fatality in 35 years, according to the Tribune. These reports come just a week after a judge ruled that the footage of the shooting must be released to the public by Wednesday. Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration has been accused of withholding incriminating evidence over the course of a 13-month investigation into the incident. Like so many deaths at the hands of police, Laquan McDonald’s seemed at first destined to be mired in an unending he-said, she-said. The Chicago Police Department initially stated that McDonald, a 17-year-old African American, “lunged” at officers with a knife in a Burger King parking lot. The department’s longtime spokesman, Pat Camden, said at the scene that McDonald posed “a very serious threat,” leaving one officer no choice but to lodge a fatal bullet into the teenager’s chest. Reporters and a few witnesses were skeptical of this account, especially after the Cook County Medical Examiner announced that McDonald in fact had “multiple” gunshot wounds. An autopsy later revealed that McDonald had been shot 16 times, in different places all over his body. Jamie Kalven, the freelance journalist who first obtained the autopsy through a Freedom of Information Act request, called these details “the silent testimony of Laquan McDonald’s corpse.” Gunshot wound of the left scalp. Gunshot wound of the neck. Gunshot wound of the right upper leg. And so on. At least two bullets appeared to have gone through McDonald’s back. The medical examiner described a “well-developed, well-nourished” young man with dreadlocks and several tattoos. One on the right arm read “Quan”; another on his right hand read “Good Son”; a last on the other hand depicted a pair of dice accompanied by the catchphrase “YOLO,” short for “You Only Live Once.” McDonald wore a black hoodie and jeans. He had PCP, a hallucinogenic drug, in his system at the time of his death — explaining spokesman Camden’s remark that he exhibited a “strange gaze” as he allegedly approached the officers. The autopsy declared McDonald’s death a homicide. But was it, as the police department maintained, justified? Shortly after Kalven reported on the autopsy and called for the release of relevant video, other requests came rolling into the mayor’s office — from the New York Times, ABC and more — demanding “any and all video” pertaining to the Oct. 20, 2014, confrontation. Had it not been for the existence of this footage, interest in and attention to the investigation might have faded. Data sets provided by the Chicago Police Department, released this month by the Invisible Institute, a police accountability nonprofit organization, revealed that there has been no discipline for more than 99 percent of the thousands of misconduct complaints against officers in 2015. Of the few officers punished, African American officers faced discipline at twice the rate of their white co-workers for the same transgressions. Van Dyke, the officer expected to be indicted for McDonald’s death, has had 18 civilian complaints filed against him and was punished for none of them, according to the New York Times. Allegations included excessive force and racial slurs against black and Latino residents, all of which he denied. But as far as the McDonald case goes, many believe that the dash-cam video could prove dispositive. [White suspects sought after 5 people shot near Minneapolis Black Lives Matter protest] The footage has been viewed by several people who told the AP that it shows the young man walking away from the officers, and that Van Dyke opened fire from 15 feet away, continuing to shoot after McDonald slumped to the ground. The sequence of events was similarly relayed to the Chicago Sun-Times by Jeffrey Neslund, an attorney for the McDonald family: “He is walking. … When the officer begins shooting, the first shots spin McDonald around. The officer continues to fire from a distance of between 12 and 15 feet. McDonald falls. The only movement is the puffs of smoke coming from the teen’s torso and his head. The police officer comes into view and kicks the knife out of the boy’s right hand.” Neslund told NBC that one witness called the shooting “an execution.” Until recently, the Chicago Police Department maintained that releasing the video would hamper ongoing investigations. But a lawsuit filed this summer by reporter Brandon Smith prevailed last week, as a Cook County judge ruled in favor of lawyers who argued that the department had no legal right to withhold the video because the case is being investigated by other agencies — including the city’s Independent Police Review Authority and the FBI — and not by the Chicago police. Van Dyke’s lawyer, Daniel Q. Herbert, told reporters last week that the officer was “scared to death” and concerned for the safety of his wife and two school-aged children in the event release of the video leads to violence. Herbert urged the public not to judge Van Dyke solely based on the footage. The police department has acknowledged that he is the only officer who shot at McDonald. The judge ordered that the department release the video by Wednesday, though the city has yet to announce precisely how and when it will be made available for viewing. To many onlookers, the decision is long overdue. “The McDonald footage will come out, but a great deal turns on how it comes out,” Kalven wrote in February. “Will the city be forced to release it in a way that deepens the crisis of public confidence in law enforcement, or will it be released in a way that helps restore the ‘foundation of trust’ between residents and police on which effective law enforcement depends?” Mayor Emanuel office’s has been widely criticized for its handling of the investigation and its longstanding refusal to release the video. It drew suspicion in April when it agreed to pay the McDonald family 5 million even before the family’s lawyers had filed a suit. In recent meetings with ministers and aldermen, the Tribune reports, Emanuel said: “What happened here is wrong. There is no justification and it’s profoundly hideous.” He emphasized that “one individual” needs to be held accountable and that citizens should express their First Amendment rights in a “respectful, peaceful” way. Community leaders saw Emanuel’s statements as a last-minute attempt to quell the protest that is expected upon the video’s release. “Many in my community feel betrayed, many are so very angry and protests are imminent, and from the meeting today it’s very clear that Mayor Emanuel knows that,” the Rev. Ira Acree, a pastor present at the city hall meeting with ministers, told the Tribune. He said: “There is a group that is not listening to him and not listening to us either, but nevertheless we are hoping these protests and demonstrations will be peaceful. But we know they are coming, because if there was no protest that would mean we’ve become immune to this madness.” Whole Foods Thanksgiving turkeys endure ‘horrific conditions’ at Calif. farm, animal rights activists say ACLU sues Indiana Gov.

After countless battles against the creatures of the night and the tragic loss of his beloved, he has succumbed to a burnt-out existence. The shadows of his past continue to haunt him, and he seeks solace in alcohol to numb his pain. Peter's relentless struggle to stay afloat threatens to drag him into the depths of despair. He has no way of knowing that an imminent supernatural storm is about to engulf him once again. The movie begins with a series of unexplained, gruesome incidents occurring around the city. The media labels it as the work of a vicious serial killer, but Peter senses a much darker force at play. Unbeknownst to him, a sinister vampire leader, Luciana, has emerged and desires to make the city her kingdom of eternal night. Working on the sidelines, Luciana commands her horde of vampires to eliminate those who dare stand against her. As a former vampire hunter, Peter becomes the target of one of Luciana's loyal vampire lieutenants, Sebastian. However, Peter's faded skills, coupled with his severe alcoholism, result in him barely escaping Sebastian's grasp. Frustrated and humiliated, Peter suddenly finds himself craving redemption and purpose. Desperate for help, he turns to the underground network of hunters who once fought alongside him, only to learn that many have given up or perished in their fight against the undead. Determined to reclaim his throne as the most feared vampire hunter, Peter begins to sharpen his skills through rigorous training. His journey towards redemption catches the attention of Adelaide, an elusive vampire who defies her true nature by coexisting peacefully with humans. A hidden bond forms between Peter and Adelaide, forged by their mutual understanding of inner turmoil and the painful consequences of their past actions. Through his newfound ally, Peter gains a deeper understanding of the vampire world, with all its complexities and cunning strategies. Empowered by this knowledge and his reborn fighting skills, Peter rallies the remaining hunters and prepares to wage war against Luciana's growing empire. As the city faces the brink of eternal darkness, the final showdown between Peter's hunters and Luciana's vampires ensues in an epic battle of good versus evil. Bloody and brutal, the night is marred by betrayal, revelation, and sacrifice. Ultimately, Peter faces off against Luciana in a spectacular duel that will determine the fate of the city and all its inhabitants. Despite overwhelming odds and the crushing weight of his past, Peter Vincent emerges victorious. With the shadow of the vampires lifted from the city, Peter finally finds solace in his regained purpose and newfound love. As he and Adelaide walk towards the first light of the new day, they embrace a renewed hope that transcends the barriers separating their two worlds. \\"The Chronicles of Peter Vincent: Rise of the Scarlet Night\\" champions the age-old battle of light against darkness while delving into the intricacies of grief, self-redemption, and the overwhelming power of love.

Determine if any differences change the overall meaning. Step 1: Identify the main ideas in each sentence: Sentence 1: - The high cost of Stromectol - The lifelong formula Ivomec can be used - Government programs are needed to help finance veterinary medicines Sentence 2: - The high cost of Stromectol - The lifelong formula Ivomec can be used - Government programs are needed to help finance veterinary medication Step 2: Compare the main ideas The main ideas in both sentences are the same.

Additionally, Sentence 2 has a period before \\"Government\\", making it more structurally sound as two separate, complete sentences. Step 4: Determine if any differences change the overall meaning The difference in the words \\"medicines\\" and \\"medication\\" does not change the overall meaning, since both words are used to describe substances used to treat or cure diseases. The structural change in Sentence 2 does not change the meaning, but it improves the clarity by separating the two ideas.

Lucille, a crippled man who is in a wheelchair from injuries sustained in the Gulf War, searches New Orleans for his friend Melvin so a documentary crew can follow Melvin. They find him passed out on the street. Melvin, an alcoholic and drug abuser, is in a downward spiral and spends most of his time partying with his friends. His estranged ex-wife, Doreen, has filed a restraining order against him and taken sole custody of their young son, Rex. Lucille wants Melvin to clean up and get sober, but Melvin only makes empty promises to eventually get his life together. Lucas, a science teacher at the local community college, performs regular tests on Melvin, who has telekinetic powers – the ability to move objects with his mind. Lucas can not explain this except that Melvin has a slightly different brain structure than ordinary people. Melvin will not see a specialist despite Lucas' urging. Besides Lucas' tests, Melvin uses his powers to perform street shows for drug money. Lucille, however, blames the local drug dealer, Nathan, of being behind violence in the neighborhood and does not like him. This is echoed by Jimmy, a local cop. After a night of hard partying, Melvin's heart stops. When he wakes, the doctors tell him that he was clinically dead for several minutes. Changed by this experience, Melvin announces that he intends to become sober for the sake of Rex. Impressed, Jimmy requests that Melvin help clean up the neighborhood.

Given the equation: 569*j - 561*j + 329 = -492 + 213 Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining like terms. Subtract 561j from 569j on the left side of the equation, and add 213 to -492 on the right side. (569 - 561) * j + 329 = -492 + 213 8*j + 329 = -279 Step 2: Now, we have simplified the equation to: 8j + 329 = -279 The next step is to isolate 'j' by moving the constant term, 329, to the right side of the equation. To do this, subtract 329 from both sides: 8j = -279 - 329 8j = -608 Step 3: Finally, to find the value of 'j', we will divide both sides of the equation by 8: j = -608 / 8 j = -76 So, the solution to the equation is: j = -76"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\".

When the liquid cools, it does not crystallize readily but usually supercools and forms a glass, also called silica. The SiO4 tetrahedra in glassy silica have a random arrangement characteristic of supercooled liquids, and the glass has some very useful properties. Silica is highly transparent to both visible and ultraviolet light. For this reason, it is important in the manufacture of lamps that give radiation rich in ultraviolet light and in certain optical instruments that operate with ultraviolet light. The coefficient of expansion of silica glass is very low; therefore, rapid temperature changes do not cause it to fracture. CorningWare and other ceramic cookware contain amorphous silica. Silicates are salts containing anions composed of silicon and oxygen. In nearly all silicates, sp3-hybridized silicon atoms occur at the centers of tetrahedra with oxygen at the corners. There is a variation in the silicon-to-oxygen ratio that occurs because silicon-oxygen tetrahedra may exist as discrete, independent units or may share oxygen atoms at corners in a variety of ways. In addition, the presence of a variety of cations gives rise to the large number of silicate minerals. Many ceramics are composed of silicates. By including small amounts of other compounds, it is possible to modify the physical properties of the silicate materials to produce ceramics with useful characteristics. Choices: - vinylates - crystals - soils - silicates A: The answer is:","completion":"silicates. The paragraph explains that silicates are salts containing anions composed of silicon and oxygen.

Question: What is Jerry Ryan's profession? Movie plot title: Two for the Seesaw Movie plot: As the story opens, Jerry Ryan (Robert Mitchum) walking alone in lower Manhattan. Ryan was a lawyer in Lincoln, Nebraska, working in the law firm of his wife's father. No kids. After twelve years, she wants a divorce. Ryan leaves Lincoln while the divorce is pending and goes to New York to find himself. He is alone, living in a cheap room, and almost broke. He has an invitation from an old friend to an eclectic/beat party in Greenwich Village. He shows up and meets Gittel Mosca (Shirley MacLaine) at the party. Mosca is a Brooklynite who left home on her own and rented an apartment in Greenwich Village when she was fifteen. She works as a dancer of sorts, and has had a number of relationships. Ryan and Mosca hook up after a day or so and start a relationship. The core theme of the picture is how their relationship expands and develops their self-respect of themselves. The turning point for Mosca comes when she gets sick and, as Ryan is storming down the stairway, she leans over the railing and begs for help. Ryan takes her to the hospital and looks after her when she is released. Mosca discovers intimacy within love. Class rears its ugly head, but they get over it. They are acting like married people in love. Ryan receives notice that the divorce is final, but he is still conflicted about his ex (Tess). After the divorce is final, Tess calls and wants Jerry back. He agrees, but will work on his own in Lincoln and Tess must accept nothing from her father live in poverty with Jerry until his practice gets on its feet. In the final scene the couple have broken up and are in two separate sets in the same dual scene. This technique is used in the theater but rarely in movies. Ryan is leaving his room for the last time and Mosca is self-assured, self-respecting, and in control. This picture is a director's delight, with open dimensions in every scene.

Write an article based on this summary: Acknowledge that the pregnancy is not viable. Ask your doctor any questions you might have. Have a friend or loved one with you for support, if possible. Get an injection of methotrexate to dissolve the ectopic pregnancy. Consent to surgical treatment, if necessary. Article:","completion":"Title: Understanding Ectopic Pregnancy and Navigating Treatment Options Introduction An ectopic pregnancy happens when a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. This is a potentially life-threatening condition for the pregnant person, as the growing embryo cannot thrive outside the uterus and may cause severe internal bleeding if not treated. The following article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of ectopic pregnancy and the steps to take when dealing with this difficult situation, including seeking medical advice, understanding treatment options, and empowering patients through emotional support. 1. Acknowledge the reality of the situation Coming to terms with the fact that your pregnancy is not viable can be an emotionally distressing process. The hope of carrying a baby to term and becoming a parent is suddenly replaced with feelings of loss and grief. It is important to remember that you did not cause the ectopic pregnancy and that it is not your fault. Allow yourself to process these emotions and acknowledge that a non-viable pregnancy is an unfortunate but normal part of the reproduction process. Speak openly with a healthcare professional about your feelings and concerns for further support and guidance. 2. Communicate with your doctor One of the most essential steps in dealing with an ectopic pregnancy is maintaining an open line of communication with your healthcare provider. Ask any questions that you might have, no matter how trivial they may seem. Inquire about the different treatment options available to you, potential side effects, and recovery times. Seek advice on what you can do to ensure the best possible outcome for your health and future fertility. 3. Surround yourself with support During this delicate time, having the support of friends and family can be vital in mitigating emotional distress. If possible, have a loved one accompany you to medical appointments to provide emotional support and to help clarify any questions you may have. Consider joining a support group for individuals who have experienced ectopic pregnancies or pregnancy loss, or seek professional counseling to help you cope with the emotional aftermath of losing a pregnancy. 4. Methotrexate treatment If diagnosed in the early stage, an ectopic pregnancy can be treated with an injection of methotrexate. This medication is administered to help dissolve the pregnancy tissue, preventing the need for surgical intervention. Methotrexate acts by inhibiting the growth of rapidly-dividing cells, such as those found in pregnancy tissue. It is essential to follow your doctor's guidance on the administration of methotrexate to achieve the best possible outcome. Regular blood testing and ultrasound monitoring will be implemented to ensure the success of the treatment and monitor your recovery. 5. Surgical intervention In some cases, methotrexate may not be the preferred or effective treatment for an ectopic pregnancy. In these situations, your healthcare provider may recommend surgical intervention. This can include laparoscopic surgery, which involves making small incisions in the abdomen and removing the ectopic pregnancy using a laparoscope (a thin tube with a tiny camera), or a laparotomy, which is more invasive and requires a larger incision in the abdominal area. Always ensure that you understand the risks and benefits associated with your treatment option and provide informed consent before proceeding. Conclusion An ectopic pregnancy is a challenging and emotionally taxing experience. It is essential to acknowledge the reality of the situation, communicate openly with your healthcare provider, and surround yourself with the necessary support during this time. By understanding the different treatment options and working closely with your healthcare team, you can navigate your ectopic pregnancy with confidence and focus on healing and recovery."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. I am facing a new situation today: Mike has to learn more about the periodic table for his chemistry exam. To make things easier for him he chose two elements from the table, element A and element B. Element A has higher electronegativity and element B has lower eletronegativity. David found it easier to learn about elements by comparing their properties. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which element would have increased effect of electron shielding, element A or element B? The answer is:","completion":"Element B would have an increased effect of electron shielding compared to Element A. This is because Element A has a higher electronegativity, which typically correlates with being higher in the periodic table and moving from left to right across a row. Conversely, Element B has a lower electronegativity, which typically correlates with being lower in the periodic table or to the left of a row. As you go down the columns of the periodic table, the number of electron shells around the nucleus increases, causing a greater electron shielding effect. Electron shielding is the phenomenon where inner electrons partially block the positive charge of the nucleus from outer electrons. As more electron shells are added, the outer electrons experience a weaker attractive force to the nucleus due to the increased shielding, which in turn leads to a decrease in electronegativity. Therefore, considering the trends in electronegativity and electron shielding, Element B would experience an increased effect of electron shielding compared to Element A."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Choices: - confusion - anger - sadness - loss of innocence - frustration The rationale to choose \\"confusion\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"Confusion is the most accurate choice among the options provided as a problem that children may face when learning about the world. The rationale for choosing \\"confusion\\" is based on the following factors: 1. Cognitive development: Children's cognitive abilities are constantly developing, and their understanding of complex concepts is often limited. This can lead to confusion when they encounter new or challenging information about the world. Their brain is yet to develop a complete understanding of abstract thinking, logic, and reasoning. 2. Limited knowledge and experience: Children have limited knowledge and experience compared to adults, so they may not fully comprehend the intricacies and complexity of the world around them. This can make certain aspects of learning confusing and overwhelming, as they're often exposed to an immense amount of new information. 3. Ineffective communication: Sometimes, children might become confused if the information presented to them is unclear, contradictory, or too difficult to understand. This can be due to the way the information is conveyed, differences in language, or cultural barriers. 4. Emotional reactions: Children may experience a range of emotions while learning about the world, and these emotions can contribute to confusion. Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or insecure might affect their ability to process new information effectively. 5. Social influences: The opinions and attitudes of peers and authority figures can influence a child's learning process. If there are mixed or conflicting messages coming from different sources, it can be confusing for the child to discern which information is accurate or relevant. While anger, sadness, loss of innocence, and frustration may be experienced by children when learning about the world, confusion stands as the most common and overarching issue among them. It encompasses their cognitive limitations, lack of knowledge and experience, communication barriers, emotional reactions, and the influence of external factors on their understanding of the world."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Tell them what you are sick with, the flu or whatever other illness it may be. Also let them know you are intending to come to work, but will take precautions to limit spreading the disease. Letting your boss and coworkers know you are sick can also help them take measures to protect themselves. This is also a good time to ask if you can take the day off. Try saying something like, “I don’t want to get my coworkers sick and I don’t think that I will be at my best today. Is it okay if I stay home to rest and recover from this illness?” If you must go to work, then it is important to cover your mouth when you cough. Turning away to avoid coughing on another worker or covering it up with your hands is a good idea. Have tissues nearby or on your person to cover up your cough. If you can get antibacterial tissues do so. Dispose of any used tissues immediately and take care they don’t come in contact with other surfaces. If you’re in close quarters try to aim your cough at empty space or a wall. The same goes for sneezing. Your hands are one of the easiest ways you can contaminate surfaces or other workers. You’ll need to wash your hands more frequently, and thoroughly while sick at work with the flu or similar illnesses. Go to your workplace’s bathroom or wash station and run your hands under warm water and soap for 20 seconds each time. If soap is not available then have soap-less (usually alcohol based) hand sanitizer with you at all times and use it often. Use it especially before and after making hand to hand contact with another person. Having a spray can of disinfectant can help protect coworkers from contamination via surfaces. Spray handles, desk areas, seats, and if safe to do so, electronic peripherals (like a keyboard or mouse) that you might share with other coworkers. Spray down restroom surfaces in the workplace you touch too. There are any number of disinfectant sprays you can get in a store. Have one at your work station, desk, and bathroom so you can spray any surfaces you touch. This includes tools, computers, and even food. In cases where you store food at work you might want to put a note that you are sick so others know not to make contact with your food containers or mix up items you need to help your recovery. If your boss is wary of you spraying electronics with disinfectant then you might ask if the ones you touch can be isolated. This way only you are touching potentially contaminated surfaces. This applies to any other tools you may use on the job. If you are coughing and sneezing then you might ask to be allowed to work in a separate area of the office or workplace so you aren’t in close proximity to other employees. Ask your boss if you can take breaks at different times or locations so you don’t expose coworkers to your germs. If you can limit the time your coworkers and you are in the same place while you are contagious then you will reduce their exposure to your illness. Avoiding contact with others is the best way to prevent your infecting them with the flu or other illness. If you must go to work then in addition to disinfecting items and quarantining them you can alter your schedule if workflow permits so your coworkers aren’t physically close to you while you are ill. This can also allow more time to disinfect break room surfaces by you or any cleaning staff. Take advantage of separate break times to recover more of the energy you might be losing due to the illness.

What should we not think about in college? What do you think about college?","completion":"No, the following two questions are not the same: 1. What should we not think about in college? 2. What do you think about college? The first question, \\"What should we not think about in college?\\" is asking for advice on what topics or concerns might be detrimental or counterproductive to focus on while attending college. This question assumes that there are certain thoughts or concerns that would negatively impact a student's experience in college and seeks guidance on which issues to avoid. The answer to this question might discuss several aspects: - Avoiding unhealthy distractions: Students should try to maintain a balance between academic work, extracurricular activities, social life, and self-care. Getting too caught up in personal drama, excessive partying, or over-involvement in non-academic activities can compromise a student's academic success. - Minimizing negative self-talk: Negative self-talk, such as generalizing failures, overemphasizing negative outcomes, or frequently feeling overwhelmed, can be detrimental to a student's mental health and academic performance. Students should try to focus on fostering a growth mindset and seek support when needed. - Avoiding unnecessary stressors: College is already demanding, so excessive worries about future career prospects or dwelling too much on past mistakes can impair a student's ability to focus on the present and perform well in their studies. - Not obsessing over grades: College is not only about achieving perfect grades. Students should also focus on developing skills, networking, exploring interests, and enriching their overall educational experience. The second question, \\"What do you think about college?\\" is asking for an individual's opinion or perspective on college in general. This question is broader, encompassing personal experiences, ideals, or broader concepts related to college. An answer to this question might entail: - The purpose or value of attending college: Some people view college as an essential step for gaining knowledge, developing critical thinking skills, or obtaining qualifications, while others may see it as more optional, depending on one's career path and interests. - Personal experience and satisfaction: Depending on an individual's perspective, they may have had positive, negative, or mixed experiences when it comes to college. Some may find it academically fulfilling and transformative, while others may struggle with the demanding workload, social aspects, or financial burden. - A reflection on the college system: This might involve discussing the pros and cons of various aspects of college, such as the traditional lecture-style teaching, the cost of tuition, the availability of resources, and the role of colleges in addressing societal needs or inequalities. - The role of college in today's society: An individual could discuss how the perception and importance of college have changed over time and whether it remains a valuable investment given the rising costs and evolving job market. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same as the first one addresses concerns or thoughts to avoid while attending college, while the second one seeks to gather a broader perspective on college in general from an individual's point of view."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please briefly summarize this news article: John McAfee Returns to US, Admits Playing 'Crazy Card' John McAfee's month-long international run from police through two Central American nations ended with a flight to Miami, where the businessman who says he abandoned his fortune admitted to playing the \\"crazy card.\\" As a gaggle of media waited near several exit doors at the airport Wednesday night, federal authorities whisked the founder of McAfee anti-virus software off the plane and into a van. \\"They said, 'Mr. McAfee, please step forward,'\\" McAfee, 67, later told ABC News exclusively overnight at a Miami Beach hotel. \\"I was met by a dozen or maybe fewer officers. I said, 'Am I arrested?' They said, 'No, sir, I am here to help you.' That felt the best of all.\\" He eventually snuck out of the airport in a cab and headed to South Beach. After walking down famed Ocean Drive to the bewilderment of tourists and eating sushi, his first meal in three days, he sat down with ABC News and admitted to playing the \\"crazy card\\" and says he is broke. \\"I have nothing now,\\" McAfee said. He claims he left everything behind in Belize, including 20 million in investments and about 15 properties. \\"I've got a pair of clothes and shoes, my friend dropped off some cash.\\" Just hours earlier, the self-made millionaire was deported by Guatemalan police who forced him aboard his U.S.-bound flight away from the home and the two women he said he loves. After he arrived on South Beach, he said, a mysterious \\"Canadian friend\\" ordered another man he'd never met to drop off a wad of fresh 5 bills that McAfee later displayed to ABC News, pulling them from his coat pocket. He says he left his fortune, including a beachfront compound, behind after his neighbor Greg Faull was found shot to death in Belize on Nov. 10. John McAfee Collapses at Detention Center After Arrest John McAfee Arrested in Guatemala Overnight Belize officials said he isn't a suspect, but when they asked to question him, McAfee disguised himself and ran. After three weeks ducking authorities in Belize, by hiding in attics, in the jungle and in dingy hotels, he turned up in Guatemala Dec. 3. Barely a day later he was detained for entering the country illegally. As Guatemala officials grappled with how to handle his request for asylum and the Belize government's demand for his deportation, McAfee fell ill. The mysterious illness, described by his attorney alternately as a heart ailment or a nervous breakdown, led to a scene with reporters chasing his ambulance down the narrow streets of Guatemala City and right into the emergency room, where McAfee appeared unresponsive. He now says it was all a ruse: \\"It was a deception but who did it hurt? I look pretty healthy, don't I?\\" He says he faked the illness in order to buy some time for a judge to hear his case and stay his deportation to Belize, a government he believes wants him dead. When asked whether he believes Belize officials where inept, he didn't mince words. \\"I was on the run with a 20-year-old girl for three and a half weeks inside their borders and everyone was looking for me, and they did not catch me,\\" he said. \\"I escaped, was captured and they tried to send me back. Now I'm sitting in Miami. There had to be some ineptness.\\" The man who many believe only wants attention answered critics who called his month-long odyssey and blog posts a publicity stunt by simply saying, \\"What's a better story, millionaire mad man on the run. You [the media] saved my ass. Because you paid attention to the story. As long as you are reporting, it is hard to whack somebody that the world is watching.\\" He denies any involvement in his neighbor's death but adds that he is not particularly concerned about clearing his name. He is focused on getting his 20-year-old and 17-year-old girlfriends out of Belize and says he has no idea what he'll do next, where he'll live or how he'll support himself.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who dreamed of a normal life? from the following article ? When Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche escaped Tibet in 1959, he settled in Italy, where he married and had two children, of which Yeshi was the first. Yeshi was recognized as the reincarnation of Rinpoche's uncle, a renowned Dzogchen master, who had died after the Chinese invaded Tibet. Yeshi grew up in Italy and wanted nothing to do with this legacy. He had no interest in being a teacher like his father. Nor did he want to return to Tibet and the monastery of Rinpoche's uncle to meet the students waiting for him since his birth – something that his father continually admonished him to do. Instead, he dreamed of a normal life, away from the hordes of devoted students that always surrounded his father. Through intimate scenes Yeshi is shown growing from 18 years old to 39 years old and maturity, and his father who begins the story in his 50-year-old prime ages to 70 years and his senior years. As the story unravels, what is at stake for Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche is his spiritual tradition, for Yeshi it is his own identity. Will Yeshi's Western lifestyle replace his family tradition and his spiritual roots? Will his father succeed at transplanting the vanishing Tibetan heritage to the Western world? As time moves forward, both father and son begin to change. The image of water and swimming, Namkhai Norbu's beloved pastime, is used as a repetitive thematic pillar through the film as a representation of his teachings of integration and emptiness. The natural sounds of chanting and song, combined with added effects and carefully scored music, is used to express a non-verbal sense of the spiritual world Norbu Rinpoche seeks to transmit to his son, and to the West.

Article: Opposition is growing to the Berlin Zoo's plans to find a new home for Knut, the moneymaking celebrity polar bear whose popularity has been exploited by environmentalists and even Canadian tourism promoters. No longer cute, and just days before his second birthday, Knut will be given a new home that is expected to include a potential mating partner. The Berlin Zoo, facing the global economic crisis, can't afford the estimated 13 million it would take to acquire a female and a new home for them to share. \\"It's time for him to go--the sooner he gets a new home the better,\\" said senior bear keeper Heiner Kloes. But some Berliners are beginning a campaign, collecting petition signatures and arguing that he's a tourist draw and a symbol as important as the Brandenburg Gate. \\"He means a lot to many people. When you're with him you forget your problems,\\" Hartmut Wiedenroth, co-founder of the campaign, told Spiegel Online. Knut became an international celebrity in 2007, drawing huge crowds to his cage and _ sales of thousands of Knut toys and Knut-shaped candies. The Vancouver-based Canadian Tourism Commission made Knut a major part of its \\"Canada--Keep Exploring\\" campaign to draw tourists to the country-- and especially to polar bear country in northern Manitoba to see them in their natural habitat. Environmentalists also used the bear to promote the fight against global warming. But Knut's popularity diminished as his size increased to 210 kilograms, He was photographed at one point snapping at a child near his cage. In September his keeper, Thomas Doerflein, died of a heart attack. Doerflein, who became a celebrity himself after nursing the tiny ball of white fur when Knut's mother rejected him, had been re-assigned shortly after Knut's first birthday. Some animal rights critics said Knut has been showing unusually aggressive behavior because of his unnatural upbringing.

Dogs with only DEA 4 or DEA 6 can thus serve as blood donors for the majority of the canine population. Any of these DEA types may stimulate an immune response in a recipient of a blood transfusion, but reactions to DEA 1.1+ are the most severe. Is this statement correct \\"do dogs all have the same blood type\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"do dogs all have the same blood type\\" is incorrect. Dogs have multiple blood types, and there are over 13 known canine blood groups. Eight Dog Erythrocyte Antigen (DEA) types are recognized as international standards, and these DEA types include DEA 1.1, DEA 1.2, DEA 3, DEA 4, DEA 5, DEA 6, DEA 7, and DEA 8. Each of these blood types has different antigens present on the surface of their red blood cells. Among the various DEA types, DEA 4 and DEA 6 appear on the red blood cells in around 98% of dogs, making them the most prevalent blood types. Dogs with DEA 4 or DEA 6 blood types can serve as blood donors for the majority of the canine population because they are less likely to cause severe immune reactions during blood transfusions. However, it is still essential to match the blood type between the donor and the recipient to minimize the risk of any adverse reaction. One of the critical blood types in dogs is DEA 1.1. Dogs can be either DEA 1.1 positive or negative. The immunological reactions to DEA 1.1 positive blood are the most severe, and thus, it is crucial to avoid transfusing DEA 1.1 positive blood to a DEA 1.1 negative recipient. In conclusion, dogs do not all have the same blood type, and there are multiple blood types recognized in dogs. These different blood types play an essential role in blood transfusions and must be carefully considered to avoid severe immune reactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unusual Weather Hits Most of Country A fluctuation in the jet stream unusual for mid-winter has created a wild range of weather. Tornado watches have been issued for parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas, and April-like thunderstorms are expected in Chicago. Other states from Texas to Florida, Kansas and parts of the Midwest and Northeast are experiencing record heat. Record warmth is expected today ahead of the storms, with record highs possible in Chicago, St. Louis and Tampa that could reach 60 degrees or more, 73 degrees and 83 degrees, respectively. Additionally, a powerful cold front will slam into the mid-Mississippi Valley today, producing tornadoes and gusty winds near 80 mph. The biggest chance for tornadoes is from Little Rock, Ark., to Memphis, Tenn., but the entire area from Dallas to Houston, New Orleans, Chicago, Indianapolis and St. Louis could see tornadoes and damaging winds. The storms will also create flooding from the Midwest to the Northeast, with some areas getting as much as three inches of rain. The unusual weather will linger through this evening. Areas most at risk for tornadoes include southern Illinois, southwest Indiana, western Kentucky, northern Louisiana, Mississippi, southeast Oklahoma, western Tennessee and northeast Texas, according to NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center. Behind the flooding rain and record warmth, cold air is expected to move in this week. Already in the West, 18 states from Michigan to New Mexico and up to Washington have winter weather warnings and advisories. Blizzard-like conditions might develop on Thursday for places including Des Moines, Iowa; Rochester, Minn.; Eau Clair, Wis., and Green Bay, Wis. These areas will see as much as eight inches of snow, with gusty winds near 35 to 45 mph. The combination could create white-out conditions. The weather will shift dramatically in Chicago by Thursday, dropping from the record high of more than 60 degrees today to 17. Sub-zero wind chill temperatures are likely for most of the Midwest. Along the East Coast, warm air is moving in. Highs will approach 50 degrees today in New York City, with a high of 60 possible Wednesday. Washington, D.C., will approach the mid- to upper-60s Wednesday.

Plot title: Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles Movie plot: In modern-day San Francisco, reporter Daniel Molloy (Christian Slater) interviews Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), who claims to be a vampire. Louis begins by describing his human life as a wealthy plantation owner in 1791 Spanish Louisiana. He had lost the will to live following the death of his wife and infant child; one night he is attacked by the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) while drunkenly wandering the waterfront of New Orleans. Lestat senses Louis' dissatisfaction with life and offers to turn him into a vampire. Louis accepts and is transformed, but he rebels against killing humans, drinking animal blood to sustain himself. He is disgusted by Lestat's pleasure in killing and comes to suffer tremendously as a vampire. Louis finally succumbs to his hunger and kills his faithful house slave Yvette (Thandie Newton). Guilt-ridden, he tries to kill himself by setting fire to his house, but Lestat rescues him and they flee. Wandering the streets of New Orleans, amid an outbreak of plague, Louis finds an ill little girl in a house who has not realized her mother is dead. He bites the girl, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), whom Lestat later transforms into a vampire \\"daughter\\". Lestat hopes that Claudia's transformation will discourage Louis from leaving. As thirty years pass, Claudia matures psychologically but still remains a little girl in appearance. She has become a sadistic killer who closely bonds with Louis. When she finally realizes she will never grow up and have an adult body of her own, thus being trapped in the form of a child forever, she is furious with Lestat and finds herself deeply hating him for making her a vampire. She tricks him into drinking the blood of twin boys she killed by overdosing them with laudanum, knowing that blood from a corpse is fatal to vampires. This weakens him, and she slits his throat. Claudia and Louis dump Lestat's body in a swamp and the two plan a voyage to Europe. However Lestat returns on the night of their departure, having drained the blood of swamp...

By Becky Evans PUBLISHED: 05:35 EST, 19 December 2012 | UPDATED: 11:21 EST, 19 December 2012 The parents of the six-year-old British boy killed in the Sandy Hook massacre said they are 'filled with love' for the women who died trying to protect him. Nicole and Ian Hockley paid tribute to the teachers who 'selflessly' died when gunman Adam Lanza went on the rampage at the Connecticut elementary school. The couple, who moved from England two years ago with Dylan and his eight-year-old brother Jake, said: 'Though our hearts break for Dylan, they are also filled with love for these and the other beautiful women who all selflessly died trying to save our children.' Dylan 'flourished' at the school and loved his teachers Vicki Soto and OPTIONS: - Adam Lanza - Anne Marie Murphy - Becky Evans - British - Connecticut - Dylan - England - Ian Hockley - Jake - Nicole - Sandy Hook - Sandy Hook School Massacre - Vicki Soto","completion":"Anne Marie Murphy The correct answer is Anne Marie Murphy because both Anne Marie Murphy and Vicki Soto were teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School where the tragedy took place. They both tragically lost their lives trying to protect the children during the shooting. Adam Lanza is incorrect because he was the gunman and not a teacher. Becky Evans is incorrect because she is the author of the article. British is incorrect because it is an adjective describing the nationality of the boy and his family. Connecticut is incorrect because it is the location of the school. Dylan, Ian Hockley, Jake, and Nicole are incorrect because they are the names of the family members. Sandy Hook and Sandy Hook School Massacre are incorrect because they refer to the location and the event, not a teacher's name. England is incorrect because it is the country the family moved from, not a teacher's name. Vicki Soto is mentioned earlier in the passage as one of Dylan's beloved teachers, but the question asks for the other teacher."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The lady singing with a boy is a genius, isn't he? Pick your answer from: (A). unacceptable; (B). acceptable;","completion":"(A). unacceptable The sentence provided, \\"The lady singing with a boy is a genius, isn't he?\\" would be considered unacceptable by the strictest standards of a linguist for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the sentence demonstrates a pronoun-antecedent disagreement. The subject of the sentence, \\"the lady,\\" is a feminine noun that requires a corresponding feminine pronoun. However, the pronoun used in the sentence, \\"he,\\" is masculine. The correct pronoun to describe the female subject should be the feminine \\"she.\\" Additionally, the question tag at the end of the sentence should be written as \\"isn't she?\\" to maintain agreement with the gender of the subject. Secondly, the sentence's structure may lead to confusion since \\"singing with a boy\\" is an example of a reduced relative clause. Due to the position of the clause in the sentence, it can be difficult to determine whether it modifies \\"the lady,\\" \\"a genius,\\" or both. While it's likely that the intended meaning is \\"The lady who is singing with a boy is a genius,\\" the ambiguous phrasing leaves room for misinterpretation. Thus, the revised sentence that would be grammatically correct and conform to the standards of a linguist should be: \\"The lady singing with a boy is a genius, isn't she?\\" This revised sentence not only corrects the pronoun-antecedent disagreement but also ensures that the question tag at the end agrees with the gender of the subject."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Why is Kenny deciding to miss family dinner ?","completion":"Kenny is deciding to miss family dinner because he has parking lot duty at church again. This duty requires him to be at the church late, which conflicts with the timing of the family dinner. Here's an analysis of the given information: 1. Start by understanding the context: User mentioned that Kenny is supposed to be home late and this will probably cause him to miss family dinner. 2. Identify the reason for being late: Kenny has parking lot duty at church again, which implies that this is not the first time he has had this responsibility. 3. Acknowledge possible feelings of the user: The user seems to be displeased with past incidents like dropping a bottle of vinegar or having their child rip through their bread. They may be hoping for better circumstances this week, but Kenny's absence may affect the family dinner experience for the user. 4. Understand the reasoning behind decision: Kenny's commitment to his church duties likely takes priority over attending family dinner in this particular situation. He may feel that fulfilling his responsibilities at church is important, and perhaps the family has worked out an understanding regarding his occasional absence from dinner. In conclusion, Kenny is deciding to miss the family dinner because of his parking lot duty at church, which requires him to be there late. This commitment may be a priority for him, but it does affect the family dinner experience for the user."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Why do brittle materials have ultimate tensile strength and not yield strength? What is meant by average and a minimum tensile strength of a material? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Select from: [A]. no; [B]. yes;","completion":"To answer these questions, let's first understand the key terms and concepts involved: 1. Brittle Materials: These are materials that do not undergo significant deformation or plastic flow before breaking. They fracture at relatively low stress levels and often show no sign of yielding before failure. 2. Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS): The maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before breaking. 3. Yield Strength: The stress level at which a material undergoes a permanent deformation, i.e., the material transitions from elastic deformation to plastic deformation. Now, let's address each question step-by-step: Question 1: Why do brittle materials have ultimate tensile strength and not yield strength? Brittle materials have ultimate tensile strength because they do not exhibit significant plastic deformation before breaking. In other words, they do not display a clear yield point, and their elastic behavior ends with failure at the ultimate tensile strength. Since yield strength is used to describe the transition between elastic and plastic deformation, and brittle materials do not undergo plastic deformation, it is not applicable to brittle materials. Question 2: What is meant by average and a minimum tensile strength of a material? Average Tensile Strength: This is the mean value of tensile strength obtained from a series of tests on a material. It represents the strength that is expected on average, considering a large number of samples. Minimum Tensile Strength: This is the lowest value of tensile strength that a material can possess while still being considered to meet specific performance criteria or standards. The minimum tensile strength is important because it ensures the reliability and safety of the material in practical applications. Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Comparing the questions asked about brittle materials and tensile strength, I would choose the following answer: [A]. no; The questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of material properties and behavior. The first question focuses on understanding why brittle materials have ultimate tensile strength and not yield strength, while the second question deals with the definition and significance of average and minimum tensile strengths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: He looked delighted when he was presented with a traditional black and white sombrero vueltiao hat during a visit to an organic fair on Wednesday. Now, Prince Charles has two after he was given another while inspecting the treasure at the Museo del Oro Zenu in Cartagena. The Prince, clearly delighted with his duplicate gift, swiftly donned the hat and encouraged the Duchess of Cornwall to do the same with hers - much to the delight of local well-wishers. Sombrero vueltiao hats are made from cane fibre and are a symbol of Colombia, as well as the northern Caribbean region in which the city of Cartagena is located. Scroll down for video. Looking good: Prince Charles was given his second sombrero vueltiao hat of the week during a visit to a museum in Cartagena. Suits you sir: Charles looked delighted with his second hat - and the Duchess of Cornwall appeared to like hers too. Culture: The couple were at the Museo del Oro (Gold Museum) in Cartagena with First Lady María Clemencia Rodríguez de Santos. Popular: Charles got his first hat while visiting an organic food fair at the British Ambassador's residence in Bogota on Tuesday. Originally worn by peasants, the hats have become an enormously popular fashion accessory and are loved by everyone from cowboys to presidents, and now, princes. Charles and Camilla are on the last leg of an eventful four-day visit to the South American country, which has seen the Prince speak of his anguish following the death of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, as well as a passionate intervention from the Duchess on the subject of sexual violence. This morning, however, most of the drama came from a flamboyantly-dressed dancer who met the couple outside the museum, although the impressive impressive collection of fabulous gold treasures dating from the mediaeval period came a close second. A huge crowd of people, many of whom carried Union flags, had gathered outside the museum to see the couple arrive, with Prince Charles taking the opportunity to share a joke with some of the locals during a walkabout. He also tried his hand at playing the drum and appeared to be enjoying himself, even if those listening were less than enamoured with his musical talents. Following the visit to the museum, the couple continued on to the Naval Academy, where they got an insight into the country's infamous drug problem courtesy of a haul of submarines confiscated from drug gangs and now displayed outside the school. Not sure: At first, Camilla looked a little wary about trying on her black and white sombrero vueltiao hat. This is how you do it: An obliging local man then showed her how to put on and wear the hat. What do you think: The pair then looked to the Prince of Wales to see what he thought of the Duchess' new look. Success! Clearly delighted with Charles' verdict, Camilla beamed for the cameras as María Clemencia Rodríguez de Santos looked on. Afterwards, Charles and Camilla will continue on to a war memorial dedicated to the British soldiers who died during an attempt to take the city's Fort of San Felipe in 1741 before attending the Health of the Oceans conference where the Prince will make a speech. The event, which will also see a speech from Colombia's President Santos, has been organised by the Presidential Co-operation Agency and the Prince's International Sustainability Unit, and will promote sustainability in the development of marine economies. Finally, the couple will wave goodbye to Colombia during a sunset ceremony on board HMS Argyll, a Type 23 'Duke' class frigate, which is currently moored in Cartagena. The tour of Colombia began on Tuesday with a rainy welcome on the tarmac at Bogota airport ahead of a formal welcome - which included taking a salute from a guard of honour - the following day. After an encounter with ballet dancer Fernando Montaño during the state dinner that evening, the royal couple then went on to spend yesterday focusing on the real theme of the tour - promoting peace and combating sexual violence. New talent: The couple were also presented with a traditional drum, which Prince Charles couldn't resist trying out. Not so good: The Prince of Wales burst into laughter following his attempt to play the drum - along with Camilla and Cartagena locals. All smiles: The couple appeared to enjoy their visit to the museum, during which they were shown its collection of gold treasure. Charles also spoke movingly about the loss of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten, when he visited Bogota's Centre for Peace, Memory and Reconciliation which commemorates those killed and displaced during five decades of violence in the fight against guerillas and drug cartels. In a speech about how he had 'experienced the intense despair caused by the consequences of violence' and stress, he added: 'Many of you will probably not know that my own much-loved great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, and members of his family ... were murdered in Northern Ireland, just over 30 years ago. 'So I feel I do understand something of the bewildering and soul-destroying anguish that so many of you have had to endure.' Charles was extremely close to his uncle, who died in a terrorist bombing in August 1979. Indeed he viewed the Queen’s second cousin and former Viceroy of India as a second father and mentor. Mountbatten, 79, was assassinated by the Provisional IRA, who planted a bomb in his boat in Co Sligo, in the Irish Republic, during a family fishing trip. One of his twin grandsons, Nicholas Knatchbull, 14, lost his life, along with a local boat boy, 15-year-old Paul Maxwell. Another passenger on the boat, the Dowager Lady Brabourne, 82, died in hospital the day after the attack. Big arrival: The couple arrived in Cartagena, on Colombia's Caribbean coastline, after spending three days in Bogota. Colourful: The couple were met by a flamboyantly dressed traditional dancer outside the Museo del Oro Zenu. Wonderful: Charles and Camilla looked on in delight as the dancer twirled her multicoloured skirts during the dance. Magical: This is the second time the couple have encountered Colombia's flamboyant Caribbean dancers, the first time earlier this week. The only person convicted for the murders, Thomas McMahon, an experienced IRA bomb-maker, was released from jail under the Good Friday peace agreement after serving 18 years in jail. A second man was acquitted. Colombia itself is only just emerging from the longest running civil war in the world which began in 1956 and has so far claimed an estimated 250,000 lives, while displacing more than five million people. Rape and other forms of sexual violence are also widespread, with one woman raped every 15 minutes according to government estimates. The Duchess, who met with a group of brave rape victims, told MailOnline of her admiration for their courage and vowed to speak out and bring the issue of sexual violence 'into the light'. 'I was humbled by the courage of the Colombian women I met today,' she added, 'who had been raped like so many others, in horrendous circumstances, and I salute their determination to bring rape and sexual abuse out of the shadows into the light.' Later, the royal couple went their separate ways with Camilla staying in Bogota and Prince Charles travelling to La Macarena to see Cano Cristales - a river that has been dubbed the liquid rainbow thanks to its propensity for changing colour. Good work: After the dance, the couple congratulated the dancer before meeting a group of excited locals. Nice to meet you: Even more excited was the crowd of locals who had waited outside the museum to see the royal couple. Entertaining: Prince Charles, who was on jolly form, shared a joke with one delighted-looking lady. All together now: The royal couple and Colombia's First Lady also stopped for a glamorous group photo with a group of dancers. The impressive sight is the result of algae on the riverbed changing its colour at different times of the year, from green and yellow to blue and black and, famously, red. Cano Cristales, south of the capital Bogota and once part of a FARC rebel controlled area, is close to the town of La Macarena and its residents and other groups are attempting to develop a sustainable tourism programme so local people benefit from foreign visitors and the environment is protected. Julia Miranda, director of Colombia's national park service, hosted Charles' visit to the natural wonder and said, after the royal had left, that the visit had been 'marvellous', adding: 'The red colour of the waters was very intense. 'He was really happy to be here and he asked many questions and seemed really interested in the geography of the area.' Charles was also joined during his visit by Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos who has been instrumental in helping to preserve Colombia's Amazon region. He joked to Charles' entourage that the picturesque spot was known as the FARC country club where a guerrilla general would bring his partner and they would swim in the waters. Before leaving the region Charles visited the quiet settlement and toured a local church built by guerrilla fighters which has a mural painted above the altar showing Jesus with his 12 disciples, who are depicted as Colombian peasants. During the visit, the Prince chatted to members of the local community and looked utterly delighted when one excited little schoolgirl planted a kiss on his cheek. Touching: In La Macarena yesterday, Prince Charles found himself on the receiving end of a kiss from one excited little schoolgirl. Striking: Charles also visited Cano Cristales, a river dubbed 'the liquid rainbow' thanks to its propensity to change colour. Emotional: Charles spoke of his anguish at the loss of his uncle Lord Mountbatten during a speech in Bogota yesterday.

Movie title: Green Lantern: First Flight Context: Before any other sentient beings existed in the universe, a race of beings calling themselves the Guardians of the Universe harnessed the power of the green element, the greatest power in the universe, to create the Green Lantern battery. However, the battery was vulnerable to the color yellow, the one part of the light spectrum that could resist green. The Guardians hid the most concentrated source of yellow energy, the yellow element, to prevent others from using it against them. After the death of Abin Sur, several Green Lanterns arrive to take Ferris Aircraft's test pilot Hal Jordan (Christopher Meloni) to the Green Lantern Corps on Oa. He is placed under the supervision of respected senior officer Sinestro (Victor Garber), who is investigating Abin's murder. While undercover on the ship of Kanjar Ro (Kurtwood Smith) searching for the whereabouts of the stolen yellow element, Abin had come under attack. Fleeing to Earth, he had his ring find his successor and died of his injury shortly after. Unbeknownst to the other Green Lanterns, Sinestro had provided Kanjar with the location of the element in order to have it fashioned into a weapon of comparable power to the Green Lantern battery. Jordan quickly comes to understand that Sinestro's beliefs are not in line with those of the Guardians: Sinestro believes that the Guardians have reduced the Corps to merely picking up the messes criminals create as opposed to proactively dealing with the problem. During a mission to capture Kanjar Ro, Jordan is knocked unconscious by Kanjar's energy staff. Sinestro comes in and kills Kanjar, pinning the blame on Jordan. As punishment, the Guardians strip Jordan of his ring. While Jordan waits to be taken home, Sinestro uses his ring to temporarily animate Kanjar's corpse, allowing him to learn the location of Qward where the yellow element weapon is being fashioned. Jordan convinces fellow Lanterns Boodikka (Tricia Helfer) and Kilowog (Michael Madsen) that Sinestro is not what he seems. When they catch Sinestro enacting...

However, the backcountry's untamed wilderness and potential rough conditions have enhanced the risk that these extreme winter athletes face when conquering its mountains. In this thrilling narrative, we will recount the harrowing story of an American professional skier who had a near-death experience when she tumbled down one of these majestic Alaskan mountains. Prelude to the Incident: As preparations reached their peak for the ski season, the athlete decided to push her limits once more, this time embarking on a trip to Alaska. After weeks of intense training with her team, they picked a challenging route on one of the Alaskan mountain ranges, renowned for its technical difficulty and demanding backcountry skiing. Excitement blended with anxiety as the team made their way towards the slopes, unaware of the life-threatening ordeal that awaited them. The Fateful Descent: On the fateful morning, the sky presented the picture-perfect setting for an adrenaline-pumping descent. The crisp Alaskan air invigorated the team as they donned their ski gear and strapped on their helmets, ready for the thrill of a lifetime. As the professional skier descended the treacherous slope, she effortlessly tackled moguls and out-of-bounds chutes at a dizzying speed. Unbeknownst to her, however, the mountain had a formidable challenge brewing ahead. A Lucky Escape: Midway down the slope, the skier encountered an unexpected patch of loose snow that sent her careening off-balance at high speed. In these agonizing seconds, as gravity relentlessly pulled her to the unforgiving ground, the skier found herself in a life-or-death struggle for control. She tumbled helplessly through the air, catching glimpses of the rocks and cliffs below. Her heart raced as she careened closer to the jagged edge, beyond which lay only a freefall into the ravine. It was then that she miraculously found her footing and with all her might, managed to direct her skis away from the edge. But her trials were far from over. In the minutes that followed, she continued her arduous descent, an intense harrowing mix of sliding and stumbling down the icy mountainside. Against all odds, she survived the horrifying ordeal, stopping at the bottom, breathless and battered, yet alive. The Aftermath: The chilling account of her near-death experience served as a potent reminder of the sheer enormity of risks and dangers often faced by professional skiers in the pursuit of their passion. In the aftermath, the athlete made a decision to work diligently on honing her skills in perilous terrains, acknowledging the need for greater awareness and preparation. She expressed her gratitude to her rigorous training and innate self-preservation instincts, which played a huge role in her miraculous escape. Conclusion: Alaska's rugged beauty may captivate the hearts of thrill-seekers around the globe, but as this professional skier's lucky escape proves, these mountainous terrains demand nothing less than the utmost respect, skill, and preparation. Let this extraordinary story serve as a reminder to budding athletes and seasoned professionals alike that the rewards of the backcountry come hand in hand with potential heart-stopping perils, and the mountain will always have the final say."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The pastor of the church; Given those answer options, answer the question: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

How do you do this: In order to put shingles on a roof,","completion":"Installing shingles on a roof is an essential process for ensuring a durable and weather-resistant roof. Below are the steps to properly put shingles on a roof: 1. Assess and prepare the roof: - Inspect the roof condition to identify any damage, rot, or sagging areas. - Remove existing shingles, underlayment, and other materials, if applicable. - If necessary, repair any damage and ensure the roof structure is solid, level, and ready for the new shingles. 2. Gather necessary tools and materials: - Roofing shingles - Roofing underlayment (usually #15 or #30 felt) - Roofing nails - Hammer - Utility knife - Roofing cement (if needed) - Chalk line - Tape measure - Ladder and/or scaffolding 3. Install the roofing underlayment: - Install the underlayment over the entire roof, starting at the bottom edge and moving upward. This provides a waterproof barrier beneath the shingles. - Overlap each consecutive layer by at least 2 inches to prevent water leakage. - Secure the underlayment with roofing nails. 4. Determine and mark shingle rows: - Measure the length of a shingle and use a chalk line to mark horizontal rows on the underlayment, accordingly. - Mark a vertical chalk line along the center of the roof to guide shingle alignment. 5. Install roofing shingles: - Start laying shingles at the bottom edge of the roof, overlapping the eave (the bottom edge that overhangs the house sidewalls). This ensures water does not penetrate the roof. - Align the first shingle with the vertical chalk line and nail it in place using 4-6 roofing nails per shingle. - Continue laying shingles along the length of the roof, following the horizontal chalk guidelines. - When a row is complete, move up to the next row, aligning the shingle with the lower edge of the underlying row. Be sure to stagger the seams between the shingles in each row to prevent water infiltration. - Trim the excess shingle materials using a utility knife when needed, such as to accommodate vents or roof projections. 6. Install ridge cap shingles: - Cut standard shingles into three equal pieces, creating ridge cap shingles. - Place the first ridge cap shingle on the ridge, making sure it overlaps both sides of the roof. - Work along the ridge, nailing each ridge cap shingle into place, while overlapping the previous one. - The final ridge cap shingle should cover the entire ridge and overlap the previous shingle to ensure proper water shedding. 7. Inspect the roof: - Check the shingles for proper alignment, nailing, and overlaps. - Ensure all vents, flashings, and other projections are covered and sealed correctly. - Look for any debris or leftover materials that need to be removed from the roof. By following this process, you will have successfully installed shingles on a roof, providing a robust, durable, and weather-resistant surface. Remember always to follow safety guidelines while working at heights and to consult professional roofers if any concerns or questions arise throughout the process."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: You may think your bathroom is often full of bacteria and so you give it a complete cleaning once a week. But how often do you clean out and disinfect your fridge? Well, probably not often enough, according to a recent study, which found out that the fridge is the second dirtiest place in your house, just behind the bathroom. Fridge temperatures were often set too high, allowing the growth of bacteria, which included E.coil, Enterobacteria, and S. aureus, all of which will give you an easy access to food poisoning. So what can you do to ensure your fridge---and your food in it---is not a health threat? For starters, clean the fridge weekly---wipe it and repeat. Make sure your fridge is at the correct temperature for storing food, between 0 and 5 degrees centigrade. Your freezer should be below-18 degrees centigrade. You can use fridge and freezer thermeters to make sure this is the case. Some modern fridges have zones to store different types of food ,such as meat and vegetables. Make sure you don\`t store meat in the vegetable zone, as the temperature there might be higher. Make sure you don not leave the door open too long as the temperature in the fridge will quickly rise, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. Cover food that has not been finished, and eat it within a couple of days. Keep bottles and jars closed. Keep raw meat away from cooked meat. Both should be well covered to prevent pollution. Store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge to stop juices dripping onto other foods. Finally, use common sense, and throw away old food. Question: The purpose of this text is to _ .

Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less roots break up rocks happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned, \\"less roots breaking up rocks,\\" seems unrelated to the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. The process you described involves respiration, which is the inhalation of oxygen and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Plant roots breaking up rocks are part of a geological process, and do not have a direct impact on the oxygen delivery to the human bloodstream. However, an indirect effect could be considered, as plants produce oxygen through photosynthesis. If there is a reduction in the growth of plant roots, this could lead to fewer plants being present overall, potentially decreasing the total oxygen produced in the environment. However, plants produce a relatively small percentage of the global oxygen, with the majority produced by algae and other microorganisms. Hence, the effect of the perturbation on the oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream would likely be negligible.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which puppy runs into the forest and needs rescued? ? One foggy night in Devon, Gail, a working border collie Herding dog, gives birth to a litter of three puppies, cozy in a barn on Borough Farm. As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave. One day the puppies are playing in the yard when two different families come to take Storm and Drift away. They are placed in the cars and Gail sadly watches them drive away. Winter arrives at Borough Farm, but Fern has still not warmed up to Mist.

Read this: In 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, Lin Zexu, to curb smuggling. This resulted in the First Opium War (1839–42). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations. The Jardines and Apcar and Company dominated the trade, although P&O also tried to take a share. A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the importation of opium. Legalisation stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey and Persia. This increased competition for the Chinese market led to India reducing its opium output and diversifying its exports.

This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling. What is the answer to this question: What location means that Antarctica get little solar radiation?","completion":"Antarctica's location at the South Pole is the primary reason it receives relatively little solar radiation. Being situated at the Earth's southernmost point, the continent experiences extreme tilt and long periods of darkness during the winter months. During the summer, although sunlight is available for longer durations, the angle at which the sun's rays strike the Earth's surface is still oblique. This results in a significant reduction in the intensity of solar radiation absorbed by the continent, leading to its extremely cold temperature, largely frozen water, and overall frigid environment. Consequently, understanding the diverse types of Antarctic ice is crucial to assess potential impacts on sea levels and the broader implications of global cooling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the foundation that donated to complete construction work at the college? The Second World War meant that construction work on the main college buildings could not begin until 21 April 1949, when the foundation stone was laid; work on the warden's residence had begun in October 1948. Before the buildings were erected, the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road. There were further changes to Harrison's second design, as not only had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield's original donation, but additional savings had to be made in the difficult post-war economic situation. A scale model, created in 1949 as work started, showed the alterations: a shortened tower, a plainer main entrance, and no arcades within the quadrangles. Further changes were made once work was under way, including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college. The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library, instead of being purely ornamental, windows were added at regular intervals, and it was topped by a copper flèche, or small spire.A further delay in construction was announced in 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 at a cost of £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the Nuffield Foundation upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, the fellows of the college used the upper floor as a Senior Common Room. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by royal charter in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the Duke of Edinburgh on 6 June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.Colvin commented that, apart from the flèche which was similar to the initial plan,...

Thomas Edward Lawrence was born on 16 August 1888 in Tremadog, Carnarvonshire (now Gwynedd), Wales in a house named Gorphwysfa, now known as Snowdon Lodge. His Anglo-Irish father Thomas Chapman had left his wife Edith after he fell in love and had a son with Sarah Junner, a young Scotswoman who had been engaged as governess to his daughters. Sarah was the daughter of Elizabeth Junner and John Lawrence, who worked as a ship's carpenter and was a son of the household in which Elizabeth had been a servant. She was dismissed four months before Sarah was born. The chief elements of the Arab strategy, developed chiefly by Faisal and Lawrence, were firstly to avoid capturing Medina, and secondly to extend northwards through Maan and Deraa to Damascus and beyond. The Emir Faisal wanted to lead regular attacks against the Ottomans, which Lawrence persuaded him to drop. Lawrence wrote about the Bedouin as a fighting force: \\"The value of the tribes is defensive only and their real sphere is guerilla warfare. They are intelligent, and very lively, almost reckless, but too individualistic to endure commands, or fight in line, or to help each other. It would, I think, be possible to make an organized force out of them...The Hejaz war is one of dervishes against regular forces-and we are on the side of the dervishes. Our text-books do not apply to its conditions at all\\". Medina was an attractive target for the revolt as Islam's second-holiest site, and because its Ottoman garrison was weakened by disease and isolation. It became clear that it was advantageous to leave it there rather than try to capture it, while continually attacking, but not permanently breaking, the Hejaz railway south from Damascus. This prevented the Ottomans from making effective use of their troops at Medina, and forced them to dedicate many resources to defending and repairing the railway line. The movement north to Damascus and eventually Aleppo is interesting in the context of the Sykes-Picot agreement. While it is not known when Lawrence learned the details of Sykes-Picot, nor if or when he briefed Faisal on what he knew, there is good reason to think that both these things happened, and earlier rather than later. In particular, the Arab strategy of northward extension makes perfect sense given the Sykes-Picot language that spoke of an independent Arab entity in Syria, which would only be granted if the Arabs liberated the territory themselves. The French, and some of their British Liaison officers, were specifically uncomfortable about the northward movement, as it would weaken French colonial claims.

(The Drunkenness of Noah) and Gior?­dano's Philosophe Cynique are outstanding.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The Drunkenness of Noah is not an Italian painting.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the provided premise, the hypothesis \\"The Drunkenness of Noah is not an Italian painting\\" is false. The premise explicitly states that \\"Of the Italian paintings, Bellini's L'Ivresse de Noè (The Drunkenness of Noah) and Giordano's Philosophe Cynique are outstanding.\\" This statement indicates that both Bellini's L'Ivresse de Noè (The Drunkenness of Noah) and Giordano's Philosophe Cynique are indeed Italian paintings, as they are being described as outstanding examples within the context of Italian artwork. To further analyze the hypothesis and premise, let us examine the artists and their paintings individually. 1. Bellini's L'Ivresse de Noè (The Drunkenness of Noah) Giovanni Bellini (circa 1430-1516) was a prominent Venetian painter during the Renaissance era in Italy. He is known for his contributions to the Venetian school of painting, which emphasized the use of color and atmosphere in tandem with the general concepts of the Italian Renaissance. L'Ivresse de Noè, or The Drunkenness of Noah, is a painting by Bellini that depicts the biblical story of Noah becoming drunk after the flood and his subsequent humiliation. According to the premise, this painting is considered an outstanding example of an Italian painting, which directly contradicts the hypothesis suggesting that it is not an Italian painting. 2. Giordano's Philosophe Cynique Luca Giordano (1634-1705) was an Italian painter and printmaker who worked in a late Baroque style. Born in Naples, he is known for his prolific and diverse artistic output that includes frescoes, altarpieces, and easel paintings. Philosophe Cynique is one of Giordano's works, showcasing his talent for painting, and is explicitly mentioned as an outstanding Italian painting within the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The Drunkenness of Noah is not an Italian painting\\" is false when considered in relation to the given premise. Both Bellini's L'Ivresse de Noè (The Drunkenness of Noah) and Giordano's Philosophe Cynique are noted as outstanding examples of Italian paintings, confirming their status as works of Italian art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sent 5: The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Sent 6: Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Time and time again, it seems that the comedic actors of Hollywood are surprising me with their talents as dramatic performers: first it was Robin Williams {'One Hour Photo (2002)'}, then it was Jim Carrey {'Eternal Sunshine (2004)' being one example}, then Will Ferrell {'Stranger than Fiction (2006)'} and now Adam Sandler. Yes, that's absolutely right: the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless, goofball comedies {I'm not complaining; I've always been a fan} has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud. Of course, some readers may be wondering whatever happened to 'Punch-Drunk Love (2002),' but I can only assure you that it's a film I'm currently taking measures to see as soon as possible, since I've heard it's terrific. My first film from director Mike Binder, 'Reign Over Me,' is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship. Though it does occasionally stray into all-too-familiar territory, the somewhat predictable storyline proves surprisingly deep and moving, with both Sandler and Don Cheadle giving memorable performances. Alan Johnson (Cheadle) is a successful dentist with a good family, though he finds himself unable to communicate adequately with his wife (Jada Pinkett Smith) and so his marriage is a little shaky. Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) is Alan's ex-college roommate, a man who lost his entire family in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and who is still confronting his overwhelming feelings of grief. A disheveled figure with messy hair and downcast eyes {often likened in appearance to Bob Dylan}, Charlie has abandoned his career in dentistry, and spends his time in solitude: listening to music with headphones that cut out all sound from the outside world, driving around Manhattan in his motorised scooter, immersing himself in fantastical video games and repeatedly redecorating his apartment kitchen in accordance with his deceased wife's final wishes. When Alan and Charlie meet for the first time in years, the latter doesn't even recognise an old friend, having completely abandoned any memories prior to his life-crippling experience. Indeed, at first he doesn't even acknowledge the existence of his family, and abruptly loses his temper whenever anybody suggests that he seek counselling. Initially, it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the September 11 attacks as a storytelling device. Afterall, wouldn't it be just as devastating if Charlie's family had died in an ordinary, everyday car accident? However, if you consider that the director's intention was to demonstrate the enormous pain caused to ordinary citizens by the tragedy, then 'Reign Over Me' does a very good job. It's easy to get so caught up in meaningless statistics that you neglect the emotional costs of the terrorist attacks; this is the first 9/11-orientated film I've seen that truly dealt with the suffering of those who weren't even involved, whose only anguish was caused through losing those whom they loved. Adam Sandler shows surprising range in a difficult role, one which would have crumbled to pieces had he not been up to the task. Snapping instantly between cheerfulness, anger and depression, Charlie Fineman is a man with whom we can deeply sympathise, a hollow soul who, thanks to the companionship of an old friend, can finally glimpse light at the end of a dark, bleak tunnel. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is primarily positive. It appreciates the film 'Reign Over Me' for its intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship, highlighting the impressive performances by Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. While acknowledging that the story occasionally strays into familiar territory and could be viewed as potentially exploitative regarding the September 11 attacks, the reviewer believes the film effectively portrays the emotional cost of the tragedy to ordinary citizens.

This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture.

Jeffrey was being helped by Dennis through the grieving process for","completion":"his beloved dog, Sparky. After ten wonderful years together, Sparky's passing had left an unfillable void in Jeffrey's life. Dennis, being his childhood best friend and a grief counselor, insisted on helping Jeffrey to cope with his pain. Step 1: Identify emotions and accept the feeling of loss Dennis began by encouraging Jeffrey to express his emotions openly. \\"It's normal to feel sad, angry, or even guilty when losing a loved one,\\" Dennis reassured him. By discussing these feelings and accepting the emotional pain, Jeffrey would be able to begin moving through the grieving process. Step 2: Share memories through storytelling Dennis knew that retelling stories and recalling shared memories could bring comfort during difficult times. He encouraged Jeffrey to spend time reminiscing about the adventures he and Sparky had experienced together. This storytelling allowed Jeffrey to relive and cherish the special bond he had with Sparky while giving him an opportunity to truly celebrate his dog's life. Step 3: Create a memorial Dennis suggested that creating a memorial for Sparky could help immensely with the grieving process. Whether it was a photo album, a special spot in the garden, or a piece of art, having a memorial would give Jeffrey a regular reminder of the love they shared and the timeless connection between them. Jeffrey decided to create a small corner in his living room dedicated to Sparky, where he placed photographs, Sparky's favorite toys, and heartfelt letters expressing his love and gratitude for their time together. Step 4: Join a support group Knowing that others were going through similar experiences, Dennis encouraged Jeffrey to attend a pet loss support group in their community. This group allowed Jeffrey to connect with other grieving pet owners, opening a safe space for sharing emotions, stories, and coping strategies. The support and guidance from fellow pet lovers helped Jeffrey feel understood and less isolated as he learned to deal with his grief. Step 5: Allow time to heal Dennis reminded Jeffrey not to rush through his grieving process. Healing and acceptance take time, and everyone grieves at their own pace. Instead of forcing himself to move on, Jeffrey needed to give himself ample time and space to process his emotions and find a new sense of normalcy. Step 6: Explore new ways to channel feelings As Jeffrey began to heal, Dennis urged him to find new ways to channel his feelings of love and compassion for Sparky. One option was to volunteer at a local animal shelter, dedicating time and energy to helping animals in need. By giving back in Sparky's memory, Jeffrey could honor his beloved companion while finding solace and purpose in a new endeavor. Over the next few months, Jeffrey diligently worked through each of these steps under Dennis's guidance. Gradually, he came to terms with his loss and was able to remember Sparky with more joy than sorrow. While his love for Sparky would never fade, Jeffrey began to understand that it was possible to move forward and cherish the memories they had shared."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.

Which pack had more difficulty targeting prey animals? Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores. The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers. Hint: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Information: - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - The Dangerous Book for Boys, by Conn and Hal Iggulden, is a guidebook published by HarperCollins, aimed at boys \\"from eight to eighty.\\" It covers around eighty topics, including how to build a treehouse, grow a crystal, or tell direction with a watch.

Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - Historical fiction is a literary genre in which the plot takes place in a setting located in the past.

Please answer the following question: Question: where translation on DNA happens I found the following answer on Google: Prokaryotic ribosomes have a different structure from that of eukaryotic ribosomes, and thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without any detriment to a eukaryotic host's cells. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the provided answer is not directly answering the question about where translation on DNA happens. The answer explains the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes and their significance concerning antibiotic function. However, it does not specify where the translation process occurs. To correctly answer the question, \\"Where does translation on DNA happen?\\": Translation is the process of synthesizing proteins from the information encoded in the messenger RNA (mRNA), which is transcribed from DNA. This process occurs in cellular structures called ribosomes. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, translation takes place in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes are present. In prokaryotic cells (e.g., bacteria), translation starts while the mRNA is still being transcribed because prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound nucleus and their genetic material floats freely in the cytoplasm. This means that transcription and translation processes can occur simultaneously. In eukaryotic cells (e.g., plants, animals), transcription occurs in the nucleus, where DNA is located. After transcription, the mRNA is processed and transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, the mRNA associates with ribosomes, and the translation process begins. In summary, the correct answer to the question is that translation on DNA happens in the cytoplasm of the cell. Although prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes differ in structure, the location of translation within the cell remains the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this summary: – A New York City police officer has become a father more than two years after he was killed in the line of duty. Wenjian Liu was 32 years old and had been married for less than three months when he was shot and killed alongside fellow officer Rafael Ramos on Dec. 20, 2014, by a man who had made anti-police postings online. Sperm from the fallen officer was retrieved and frozen the same night at the request of widow Sanny Liu. The NYPD says that through in-vitro fertilization, Liu gave birth to a healthy daughter named Angelina in New York on Tuesday, ABC 7 reports. Friend Maria Dziergowski says Liu's parents were at the hospital within hours to meet their new granddaughter. \\"The parents were very emotional, crying and holding the baby,\\" she tells the New York Post. Liu says the night after her husband was shot dead in his patrol car, she dreamt that he was handing her a baby girl, reports NBC New York. After getting pregnant, she says, \\"I told my friend, 'It's going to be a baby girl.' My friend said, 'No, you haven't even checked the sonograms,' but I was right.\\" She says she will tell her daughter that her father was a hero—and she is looking forward to introducing her to the NYPD, her \\"big blue family.\\" (At the officer's funeral, police turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio.) Article:","completion":"A Miracle of Love and Science: NYPD Officer Wenjian Liu Becomes a Father Two Years after His Tragic Death On December 20th, 2014, New York City police officer Wenjian Liu, 32, was fatally shot in the line of duty in a tragic event that shocked the nation. His fellow officer, Rafael Ramos, was killed alongside Liu by a man who had previously posted online content expressing anti-police sentiments. Liu had been married for less than three months when his life was violently cut short. His wife, Sanny Liu, however, ensured that her husband's legacy would live on by making a special request on the night of his death. Through a remarkable combination of love, determination, and scientific advancement, Officer Liu became a father more than two years after his death, as Sanny gave birth to their healthy baby girl, Angelina, in New York City. In an unprecedented turn of events, sperm from the fallen officer was retrieved and frozen on the very night of his death, following the request made by his grieving widow. With the help of in-vitro fertilization (IVF), Sanny Liu gave birth to her daughter Angelina on a Tuesday, as reported by ABC 7. This remarkable achievement demonstrates the incredible advances made in modern medicine and the power of love to overcome even the most tragic of circumstances. Maria Dziergowski, a close friend, shared that Liu's parents had arrived at the hospital within hours of the birth to meet their new granddaughter. The grandparents were tearful and emotional as they held Angelina in their arms. \\"The parents were very emotional, crying and holding the baby,\\" she told the New York Post. According to NBC New York, Sanny Liu recalled a dream she had the night after her husband was killed in his patrol car, in which he appeared to her, handing her a baby girl. Buoyed by this vivid experience, Sanny remained convinced throughout her pregnancy that she would be giving birth to a daughter. \\"I told my friend, 'It's going to be a baby girl.' My friend said, 'No, you haven't even checked the sonograms,' but I was right,\\" she recounted. Sanny Liu plans to tell her daughter about her father's bravery and ultimate sacrifice, ensuring that her husband's heroic legacy lives on in the heart of their child. Furthermore, Mrs. Liu intends to introduce little Angelina to the NYPD, her \\"big blue family.\\" Members of the NYPD had shown solidarity and sorrow for their fallen comrade at his funeral, where many officers turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio in a powerful expression of unity amidst heartbreak. The miraculous birth of baby Angelina underlines the remarkable progress made in reproductive science in recent decades. Most importantly, this heartwarming story demonstrates the resilience of the human spirit and the incredible lengths to which love and family can triumph over the devastating impact of grief and loss."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: Exam Movie plot: Eight candidates for a top job at a mysterious company are gathered in a windowless room with two rows of desks. They have passed previous requirements not mentioned in the film. They each choose a seat and upon each desk is a piece of paper which identifies them as, \\"Candidate 1\\", \\"Candidate 2\\", etc. The invigilator, (Colin Salmon), arrives and sets forth the rules for the test.Inside the room there will be no laws other than what the company permits, as such. The candidates cannot try to communicate with the invigilator himself nor the guard. They cannot spoil the paper and they cannot leave the room for any reason. If they break any of the rules, they will be disqualified. The test consists of answering one question. The invigilator asks the candidates whether they have any questions.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Yes. 20 years ago. When I was a lot younger. I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live. Making my life extremely hard for no more reason than having my work stolen. If I wasn't so tough, and for a few people left who have at least some integrity, I would be dead now, like the rest of their victims. I have lost respect for quite a few people who I used to think were really talented. I now understand where there talent comes from… Shame on them.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the given equation 0 = -28d + 19d + 72 for d, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms First, we combine the terms with 'd' in them. -28d and 19d are like terms since they both have 'd' as their variable. When we combine them, we get: -28d + 19d = -9d (because -28 + 19 = -9) Now the equation is: 0 = -9d + 72 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'd' To find the value of 'd', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. In our case, we need to move the 72 to the other side of the equation. To do this, subtract 72 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 72 = -9d + 72 - 72 Which simplifies to: -72 = -9d Step 3: Solve for 'd' Now, we just have to solve for 'd' by dividing both sides of the equation by -9: -72 / -9 = -9d / -9 Which simplifies to: 8 = d So, the value of 'd' that satisfies the equation 0 = -28d + 19d + 72 is d = 8."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: This article: The traditions of the local peoples are unanimous in affirming that the oldest inhabitants of Casamance are the Bainuk people and that the left bank of the mouth of the river was first populated by the Jola. Portuguese sailors reached the west African coast in the 15th century, and in the 16th century, Portuguese traders became active in the Casamance region, mostly in search of wax, ivory, and slaves. They did not linger on \\"Mosquito Island\\", instead founding their first trading post at Ziguinchor in 1645.In the late 1820s, a mulatto trader from Gorée, Pierre Baudin, moved to Itou and began planting rice and producing lime by crushing the shells of mangrove oysters and cooking them in lime kilns. The French administration treated Baudin as their representative on the island and did not send others because few of the French wanted to live on the island. Being wet and marshy, Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation. The local economy was based mainly on weedy rice, which was sold in Ziguinchor or to the British in The Gambia. The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and, despite the declaration of its official abolition in the French colonial empire in 1848, slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century.The colonial administration wanted to expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, who was in charge of Gorée, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted. contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the person was in charge of Gorée?, what is it ?

Read this and answer the question The early Manchu rulers also established two foundations of legitimacy which help to explain the stability of their dynasty. The first was the bureaucratic institutions and the neo-Confucian culture which they adopted from earlier dynasties. Manchu rulers and Han Chinese scholar-official elites gradually came to terms with each other. The examination system offered a path for ethnic Han to become officials. Imperial patronage of Kangxi Dictionary demonstrated respect for Confucian learning, while the Sacred Edict of 1670 effectively extolled Confucian family values. The second major source of stability was the Central Asian aspect of their Manchu identity which allowed them to appeal to Mongol, Tibetan and Uighur constituents. The Qing used the title of Emperor (Huangdi) in Chinese while among Mongols the Qing monarch was referred to as Bogda khan (wise Khan), and referred to as Gong Ma in Tibet. Qianlong propagated the image of himself as Buddhist sage rulers, patrons of Tibetan Buddhism. In the Manchu language, the Qing monarch was alternately referred to as either Huwangdi (Emperor) or Khan with no special distinction between the two usages. The Kangxi Emperor also welcomed to his court Jesuit missionaries, who had first come to China under the Ming. Missionaries including Tomás Pereira, Martino Martini, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, Ferdinand Verbiest and Antoine Thomas held significant positions as military weapons experts, mathematicians, cartographers, astronomers and advisers to the emperor.

In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \\"lawn\\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others, or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others. Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium. Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses: the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect, and then alter or kill. In the case of viral identification, a region of dead cells results from viral growth, and is called a \\"plaque\\". Eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What type of medium is provided for a specific agent in a microbial culture?","completion":"In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. This medium has special ingredients like nutrients, water, and sometimes other things to help the tiny living things like bacteria or viruses grow. Think of it like special food for them to grow and stay alive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Premise: \\"yeah i could i could probably go half a pound\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Possibly I could go half a pound.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"yeah I could I could probably go half a pound,\\" it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis \\"Possibly I could go half a pound\\" is true. Let's break down why this conclusion can be made. Initially, we need to understand the meaning of both the premise and hypothesis statements. Premise: \\"yeah I could I could probably go half a pound.\\" This statement has a sense of affirmation given by the word \\"yeah,\\" and a measure of probability is indicated by the term \\"probably.\\" The speaker is stating that they are confident in their ability to take on half a pound, although they do not guarantee it with absolute certainty. The repetition of the phrase \\"I could\\" adds a slight emphasis to their confidence. Hypothesis: \\"Possibly I could go half a pound.\\" The word \\"possibly\\" adds a layer of uncertainty to the statement, implying that the speaker believes there is a chance they could handle half a pound. It is important to note that the hypothesis isn't refuting the possibility of going half a pound, but rather it accepts the potential for that outcome without asserting it as a certainty. When comparing the two statements, we find some common ground in both. They both reflect the speaker's potential to handle half a pound. The premise provides more confidence in the ability to achieve this, while the hypothesis provides a more cautious, uncertain approach. Considering these parallel themes and their overlapping nature, it is plausible to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Possibly I could go half a pound\\" is true when taking into account the premise \\"yeah I could I could probably go half a pound.\\" The statements are not contradictory, and the hypothesis aligns with the premise in terms of the mentioned possibility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

View, Interrupted: The Spoiling of Manhattan’s Skyline MANHATTAN is an island of serious wealth, endless ambition and impossibly expensive real estate. It is also an actual island, which means that some people are priced out for a variety of reasons and leave at the end of the day. That would include me. That means a bridge, a tunnel or a helicopter. (Then again, if you have enough money for a chopper, you can probably live where you like.) In my case, I live in northern New Jersey and commute through the Lincoln Tunnel, either by bus or by car, traveling on the so-called helix. When it is not under construction, which is frequently, the helix is an engineering marvel, a nearly circular switchback straight out of the roller-coaster school of architecture that allows cars and buses to descend from the bluffs above to the shoreline below, and reverse in ascent. There are a lot of us at the Lincoln Tunnel: Every weekday, over 100,000 cars, buses and trucks pay a significant toll in time and treasure to gain access from New Jersey to Manhattan, and then line up to flee at the end of the night. Two apartment buildings under construction in Weehawken, N.J., steal a momentary pleasure once afforded to commuters. Credit By David Carr and Robin Lindsay on Publish Date May 31, 2014 Credit Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times It can be brutal. After a day of fighting for a place to stand on the island to get business done amid a thicket of self-important people in a hurry, we are again back in the queue, waiting our turn. But halfway up the helix, the city we just left roars into view in side profile. Big on top (Midtown), thinner in the middle (Chelsea and Greenwich Village) and big on the bottom (Downtown), the city is irresistible, a sexy colossus in Rubenesque recline. For a few brief seconds, we all stare at what many believe is the greatest city in the world. It is, I have found, an easier place to love at this distance. Climbing the helix each evening used to be an ideal time to assess my day of scurrying about at the feet of those majestic behemoths. Twinkling against a glowing sky, the city said goodbye in its own way and I returned the favor. If on that day the city opened up before me like a giant, improbable rose — it happens — I would blow it a kiss. If, on the other hand, the city had had its way with me, punishing without mercy, I deployed one of my fingers as a gesture of rebuke. Most often, though, the city had both punished and uplifted. On those days, I still used the finger, but gave the finger a kiss as I did it. The hybrid gesture, weird I know, was an acknowledgment that even though the city or some of its inhabitants may not have been kind to me, I still loved it anyway. New York doesn’t beg for forgiveness, but I and many others offer it unbidden. Even if I don’t own a piece of it, it owns a piece of me — while I am happy most nights to leave it, I never imagine saying farewell for good. But that reverie has been reframed and mostly ruined. For the past several months, two new apartment buildings have been creeping up over the lip of the helix on the New Jersey side, obscuring what was once a million-dollar view. The buildings are ungainly in their nascent state and very much in the way. Regardless of how they will look once they are finished in shiny skin, they will be solid and opaque, stationed between the helix and Midtown across the river, smack dab in the way of New Jersey commuters who have, for decades, greeted the city in the morning or waved goodbye at night. The Estuary Luxury apartment buildings in Weehawken will rise to 90 feet, according to an article in The Star-Ledger, enough to block the view for many precious seconds but lower than the 160-foot office-and-apartment proposal that was floated back in 1999. I’m sure it will be a lovely place to live, with amenities that include a rooftop deck, a golf simulator, a yoga room and a fire pit. And there is, of course, that incredible view. I don’t mention any of this in the belief that the township of Weehawken or the developers will come to their senses and stop in mid-hammer swing. What’s done is done. (Speaking of which, after coming down the helix and seeing Downtown on fire after the attacks of Sept. 11, I have watched the city rebuild, a time-lapse of recovery the new buildings won’t erase.) But something glorious, a view held in common by thousands of people who come to New York for the same reasons people always have, will now belong to a precious few. It’s not only a perfect metaphor for our times, but a cold fact that I stare at every day. I often mutter oaths, not at the men and women building it — everyone has to work at something — but at the people who decided that a view that is the visual equivalent of Wagnerian opera was something to be auctioned off. Weehawken’s mayor, Richard Turner, told The Star-Ledger that some of the view will be preserved and that for those who want the full expanse, “My answer always is, move here.\\" I’d prefer to stay put. And I will continue the slog into the city, but there will be something missing from my ride. There’s still a brief interlude of New York cityscape I can see from my bus or car seat if I pay attention, but I don’t look that way so much anymore. When I look toward the city, I don’t see the glorious handiwork of human hands — I see what happens when those hands don’t know when to quit. I keep my own hands in my lap and my kisses to myself.

Question: The empty cement truck weighed less than the full cement truck so it was _____ when it was accelerating (A) faster (B) slower Answer:","completion":"The empty cement truck weighed less than the full cement truck, so it was (A) faster when it was accelerating. A detailed explanation for the answer: In the context of this question, it is important to consider the key factors that affect the acceleration of a vehicle, such as mass and force. The main difference between an empty cement truck and a full cement truck is the mass of each vehicle. An empty cement truck has a significantly lower mass compared to its full counterpart due to the absence of cement in the mixer drum. According to Newton's second law of motion, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, this can be represented by the formula: Acceleration (a) = Net Force (F) / Mass (m) As the mass of the empty cement truck is lower than that of the full cement truck, the denominator in the equation becomes smaller, provided that the net force acting on both vehicles is the same. Consequently, when the mass decreases, the acceleration increases following the inverse proportionality rule. Additionally, the engine power and torque play significant roles in a vehicle's acceleration. However, when comparing an empty cement truck with a full cement truck, the engine power and torque remain constant, as they are intrinsic properties of the engine itself rather than dependent on the amount of cement in the mixer drum. Hence, keeping factors like engine power and torque constant, and considering the difference in mass between an empty and full cement truck, the empty cement truck will have a greater acceleration when compared to the full cement truck. Finally, in practical scenarios, there are other factors that can affect acceleration, such as tire grip, road conditions, and aerodynamics. Nonetheless, in this particular context, with an explicit focus on mass as the major differentiating factor, the empty cement truck will have a faster acceleration as per Newton's second law of motion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A police car moves through the streets of Alhambra, California. The car stops at a police station, and the officers inside it transport their drunk prisoner to the station. Inside the station, Marilyn Gregor (Dolores Fuller) meets Inspector Johns (Lyle Talbot) and Lt. Bob Lawrence (Steve Reeves). Through their discussion, the viewers learn that her brother Don Gregor (Clancy Malone) had been arrested for carrying an unlicensed handgun. She has just posted bail for him, and the two officers warn her that she would forfeit if her brother fails to show up for his trial. They release her brother, but they refuse Don's request to return his handgun. As the Gregor siblings leave, John Muses about the son of a great doctor being a jerk. Lawrence suggests it could be a result of the \\"sins of the father\\".[2] Johns suspects the young man was an associate of gangster Vic Brady (Timothy Farrell).[2]The Gregor siblings return home and Don immediately heads for the liquor cabinet in the living room, pouring himself a drink. He then reminds Marilyn that he is a legal adult, and claims to know what he in doing. Both statements aim to prevent Marilyn from lecturing him on his behavior. They briefly argue and she breaks his glass. Afterwards, Don opens a book safe and retrieves a hidden revolver. As he prepares to leave, Don has a chance encounter with his father Dr. Boris Gregor (Herbert Rawlinson) at the front door. The son exits into the night, while the father enters the home.[2] As his daughter pours a drink for him, the Doctor reveals that he is already aware of Don's association with Vic Brady and his recent arrest. Inspector Johns had notified him with a phone call. But he is not particularly worried, feeling that everything will work out in the end. He blames Don's current behavior on the premature death of Mrs. Gregor and his own upbringing having had the unintentional effect of spoiling the boy.[2]While Marilyn expresses concern over the influence of Brady on Don, her father continues to drink. He then heads for the book safe and discovers that the revolver is missing. He seems aware of his son's secrets, despite his apparent denial concerning his criminal tendencies.[2] The scene shifts to the Hunters' Inn, a bar in Temple City, California, where Don and Brady meet. Don receives his share of the money for his role in a recent robbery. They are then joined by Johns and Lawrence, and briefly \\"cops\\" and \\"crooks\\" (as they call each other) drink together. The policemen provoke Don into a confrontation, and he knocks over Johns' drink. As the officers intended, this gives them the excuse to frisk him. They fail to find the revolver, as he had earlier offered it to Brady for safekeeping. John orders both criminals to leave the bar and they obey.[2]Outside the bar, Brady chastises Don for his impulsive behavior with the officers. Don wants revenge against Johns, but Brady dismisses the idea and reminds his partner that they have other plans. They are going to rob the payroll of the Monterey Theatre, though Don has his doubts about the plan.[2] At the Gregor House, Marilyn has changed into her nightgown while her father sleeps in an armchair, probably drunk. She wakes him up to discuss their concern over Don's nocturnal activities. The father states that he can't see his own son as a wrongdoer. But he also expresses guilt over his own failure as a father.[2] In the theatre, Cotton Watts performs in blackface. After his act, which involves comedy, dancing, and orchestra music, the theatre closes for the night. Brady and Don break into the closed theatre and ambush the nightwatchman (Bud Osborne).[2]The nightwatchman is forced at gunpoint to open the safe for the criminals. At this point Miss Willis (Mona McKinnon), a bookkeeper, end her shift and attempts to leave the building. She startles the criminals, and the robbery starts having casualties. Don shoots and kills the nightwatchman, while Brady shoots the fleeing woman in the back. Afterwards Brady collects their loot while Don seems to be in shock over his own actions. The two criminals flee while police sirens are heard approaching the theatre. A car chase scene follows, with the driving Brady managing to lead their car to safety.[2] At the theatre, a doctor examines the wounded Willis, while Johns receives the basic information on the case: robbery, murder, and attempted murder. The nightwatchman is identified as a recently retired veteran of the police force, who took his last the job just to relieve his boredom. The officers decide to treat this case as one involving cop killers.[2] The press has already arrived at the murder scene, in the person of a female reporter (Regina Claire) and her photographer.[2]Brady leads Don to the residence of his gun moll, Loretta (Tedi Thurman). While he explains their situation to her, Don leaves unnoticed. When Loretta notices his absence, Brady decides to search for him.[2] The following night, Don wanders the streets until deciding to visit his father's office. He confesses the murder to his father, and the doctor urges him to surrender to the police. The guilt-ridden Don agrees to do so eventually, but wishes for more time to think things through. His father helps him escape the arriving police. While fleeing Don is captured by Brady, who drives him back to Loretta's residence. The three of them listen to the radio, where the case of Paul McKenna (the nightwatchman)'s murder is covered and both their names are announced as murder suspects. Also mentioned in the broadcast is that Don is the son of a famous plastic surgeon.[2] Don repeatedly expresses his decision to surrender and face the consequences of his actions. Fearing for his own safety, Brady kills his partner. The corpse is temporarily stored behind a curtain.[2]An argument between Brady and Loretta follows. She accuses him of destroying everything and everybody that comes in contact with him, while Brady reminds her that he once rescued her from the gutter. He insists that she should stay by his side to the end. The two end the argument in an embrace. At this point, Brady conceives a plan to elude the police by undergoing plastic surgery.[2] He contacts Dr. Gregor, claiming that he is holding Don hostage until plastic surgery is completed. The doctor decides to have Marilyn assist him, since she is a trained nurse.[2]Days later, Lawrence attempt to romance Marilyn, with the ulterior motive of seeking further information on Don. She coldly turns him down. Later than night, Brady, the doctor, Loretta, and Marilyn gather in preparation of the operation. Brady expresses his distrust of the Gregors and has to be convinced that anesthesia is necessary. With Brady sedated, Don searches Loretta's residence for a water basin. He finds it, but also finds Don's stored corpse. He keeps this a secret and maintains a facade of calmness while performing and completing the operation. He claims that the bandages covering Brady's face have to stay on for two weeks. The necessity of a second visit saves his life and that of his daughter, as Loretta had orders to kill them both once the operation was over.[2]Two weeks later, Brady and Loretta arrive to the Gregor residence on schedule. But so do Johns and Lawrence, who were both summoned by the doctor. They want to know who the bandaged man is. When Brady's bandages are removed, his new face is revealed to be modeled after that of Don. Besides the Doctor, everyone else considers him to be the wanted murderer. And the Doctor claims that the man is his son. A horrified Brady attempts to flee and is killed in a shootout with the police. His dying body falls into a swimming pool.[2] A:","completion":"Question: In which city does the police car move through the streets? Answer: Alhambra, California.

Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state. Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of nitrates? Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Summarize this article: Former schoolteacher Mary Kay Letourneau and husband Vili Fualaau, with whom she began a sexual relationship when he was her sixth-grade student in Seattle in 1996, have legally separated and a reconciliation seems unlikely, PEOPLE confirms. “They’ve been having issues for a while now,” says a source close to the couple. “They tried to work through them, but it didn’t work. They’re still committed to being good parents to their children.” There is no third party involved in the relationship, the source says. Letourneau’s friend and former attorney David Gehrke says it was Fualaau who filed for separation. “She could try to contest it, but that’s legally tough to do,” he says. “Perhaps if they want to figure out about the children and child support, but their kids are getting pretty old now.” “When one person is unhappy in the relationship, the other person can’t be happy either,” he continues. “And there are two people in this relationship.” Their initial affair — which began while Letourneau was a 34-year-old mother of four and Fualaau was 12 — ignited national controversy and revulsion, particularly after she defied a court order to stay away from Fualaau. “The two of them want to be together,” a friend of Letourneau’s told PEOPLE in a 1998 cover story. “They’re drawn together like magnets.” Prosecutors took a different view, arguing at the time that Letourneau “doesn’t believe she did anything wrong.” After the relationship was revealed, she pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree child rape and was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. She and Fualaau married in May 2005 after she was released, and they have two children. “I’m convinced they were totally in love,” Gehrke says.

They sat down with PEOPLE for an extensive interview in 2006. Fualaau, then 22, said he sometimes wondered about the past. “I think, What would my life have been like if I had never made a move on Mary?” he said. “What if I had kept it as a crush and left it at that? Where would I be and where would she be — what would life be like?” But he said he didn’t see an answer to such speculation. “I can never see more than the question.” • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Letourneau revealed then that she would like to get her name taken off the sex offender registry, though officials in Washington state tell PEOPLE she is still a registered offender. “There is a story of us that has a life of its own, but it’s not our story,” she told Walters. When Walters asked Fualaau how he’d feel if the girls came home and said they were sleeping with their teacher, he responded, “I don’t support younger kids being married or having a relationship with someone older. I don’t support it.” • With K.C. BLUMM and ALEX TRESNIOWSKI ||||| Vili Fualaau, 33, filed for legal separation from Mary Kay Letourneau, 55, earlier this month, according to court documents.

Fualaau, 33, filed for the legal separation from Letourneau, 55, earlier this month, according to King County Superior Court documents. The couple have been married since 2005. Their separation was first reported Tuesday afternoon by TMZ. The two met when he was in the second grade and she was a teacher at Shorewood Elementary School in Burien. Their relationship became sexual when he was 12 and she was 34 and a married mother of four. She was arrested in 1997 after she became pregnant with his child, and was convicted of second-degree child rape. She was paroled after six months but was again caught having sex with Fualaau, a violation of her parole conditions. She gave birth to the couple’s second child in prison while serving the remainder of her 7½-year sentence. She was released in 2004 and the couple married in a ceremony in Woodinville the next year. Their relationship sparked national attention and was chronicled in the Lifetime movie “Mary Kay Letourneau: All American Girl.” The two, with their two daughters, were interviewed by Barbara Walters in 2015. The couple and their two daughters have remained in the region, with their last address listed in Des Moines. Starting in 2009, the two hosted “Hot for Teacher” nights at a Seattle nightclub. |||||","completion":"Mary Kay Letourneau, a former schoolteacher, and her husband Vili Fualaau, whom she began a sexual relationship with while he was a sixth-grade student, have legally separated.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do cancer cells produce?\\" is \\"direct energy\\", given that cancer cells produce antibodies? Answer:","completion":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what do cancer cells produce?\\" is not \\"direct energy\\". Cancer cells have multiple properties and functions that distinguish them from normal cells. While they may produce some proteins or molecules, their primary characteristic is uncontrolled and rapid growth. Cancer cells do not typically produce antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system, specifically by B cells (a type of white blood cell), to bind and neutralize foreign substances or pathogens. Although cancer cells can evade the immune system and may induce abnormal immune responses, they do not produce antibodies themselves. Instead, cancer cells produce various substances as a result of their unregulated growth and altered metabolism. For example, they can secrete growth factors to promote their own growth and survival, enzymes to degrade the extracellular matrix and facilitate invasion, and angiogenic factors to stimulate new blood vessel formation, which supports their nutrient and oxygen requirements. It is through their altered metabolism that cancer cells generate energy for their growth and survival, primarily through a process known as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect. Despite the availability of oxygen, cancer cells preferentially use glycolysis to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from glucose, at a higher rate than normal cells. This phenomenon allows cancer cells to support their rapid proliferation but is less efficient in terms of ATP production compared to oxidative phosphorylation, which is the primary mode of energy production in normal cells. In conclusion, cancer cells do not produce \\"direct energy\\" or antibodies. They generate energy through altered metabolic processes, primarily aerobic glycolysis, and are characterized by uncontrolled growth and invasion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although the narrator mentions that they love rain and walking in the rain, they explicitly state that they do *not* love having to ride a bike with poor brakes in cold, sticky rain. This implies that they would not have chosen to ride a bike in such conditions simply because they enjoy it. In addition, there is no mention of needing exercise as a motivating factor for choosing this mode of transportation. The passage does not directly state that the narrator lacks a car.

The Canadian world number 48 is suing the USTA for damages after suffering concussion at the Grand Slam in New York in September. The USTA claim Bouchard should not have gone into the treatment room without \\"express consent of, or accompaniment of, authorised personnel\\". Bouchard, 21, is seeking compensation for lost income and medical costs. She withdrew from the US Open prior to a fourth-round match after the fall and pulled out of her comeback event at the China Open on 5 October because of dizziness. The lawsuit alleges Bouchard slipped on \\"a foreign and dangerous substance\\" in New York and also claims that the injury has damaged her quality of life. However, in its legal response to Bouchard's claims, the USTA claims that \\"as a highly ranked and/or seeded professional tennis player, the plaintiff was experienced and well-versed in the procedures and protocols of the women's tour\\" and \\"knew or should have known the procedures and protocol as they related to the operation of the physiotherapy room\\". It also disputes Bouchard's claim that the physiotherapy room was dark, insisting that even with the main lights turned off, \\"twilight lighting\\" remains on at the Flushing Meadows venue. The USTA add that any suggestion that Bouchard would have won titles in Tokyo - a tournament from which she withdrew - and Beijing - where she retired from her first-round match when trailing Andrea Petkovic - had she not suffered her fall were \\"entirely speculative and uncertain\\". It also claims that Bouchard left the New York venue without taking up offers of medical help after her fall. Bouchard's lawyer Benedict Morelli told the New York Times in October that they could be seeking damages worth \\"millions and millions\\". The case is now set to be heard by a jury. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The Canadian tennis player, Eugenie Bouchard, ranked 48th in the world, is currently in a legal dispute with the United States Tennis Association (USTA). Bouchard's lawsuit comes as a result of a concussion she suffered during the Grand Slam event in New York in September, for which she blames the USTA. Claiming that she slipped on a \\"foreign and dangerous substance\\" in a treatment room, Bouchard is seeking compensation for the income she lost and the medical expenses she incurred due to the injury. The concussion led Bouchard to withdraw from the US Open prior to a fourth-round match, and later forced her to pull out of the China Open where she experienced dizziness. Bouchard's lawsuit suggests that this incident not only caused her physical harm, but greatly affected her quality of life. However, the USTA has contested these claims, arguing that as a professional tennis player, Bouchard should have known better than to enter the treatment room unescorted by authorised personnel. The USTA also refutes Bouchard's claim that the room was dark at the time of the incident, stating that \\"twilight lighting\\" is always on at the Flushing Meadows location. In addition, the USTA argues that any speculation that Bouchard would have won titles at subsequent tournaments in Tokyo and Beijing had she not been injured is uncertain and purely conjecture. The association maintains that Bouchard declined offers for medical assistance after her fall in New York. Bouchard's attorney, Benedict Morelli, indicated to the New York Times that the damages sought could total \\"millions and millions.\\" The case is set to be decided by a jury."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Firstly, the phrase \\"friel pulls the strings\\" suggests manipulation or control over someone else, which is typically perceived negatively. It implies that Friel has influence over Williams' emotional state, and they might be abusing that power to cause the melancholic feelings in Williams. Furthermore, the description of Williams \\"sinking into melancholia\\" evokes a sense of sadness, depression, or despair. Melancholia is a term that historically referred to an emotional state of deep sadness or overwhelming gloominess. It is seen as a negative emotional state one would prefer to avoid. As such, a sentence that indicates someone is causing another person to enter a state of melancholia would also be seen as negative. Combining these two elements - Friel's manipulative actions and Williams' melancholic state - the overall sentiment of the sentence is perceived as negative. The sentence suggests that Friel is contributing to Williams' negative feelings, either intentionally or unintentionally, which generates a sense of sympathy for Williams and possibly disapproval for Friel's actions, further reinforcing the negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: What do you put around a garden to keep animals out? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. park B. fence C. ground D. vines E. full bloom The answer is:","completion":"B. fence To protect your garden from unwanted animals, the most suitable option among the choices provided is to install a fence around it. A fence serves as a physical barrier that not only deters animals from entering your garden but also helps to prevent them from causing damage to your plants, flowers, and vegetables. There are various types of fences that can be used to keep animals away from your garden, and the kind of fence you choose depends on which animals you want to keep out. Here is a rundown of some fencing options and the animals they are most effective against: 1. Wire mesh fencing: This type of fencing is comprised of a fine mesh made from galvanized wire which is ideal for keeping out small animals such as rabbits and rodents. The small gaps in the mesh make it difficult for these animals to squeeze through the fence. 2. Picket fencing: Picket fences are a classic garden fencing option that consists of evenly spaced vertical wooden boards. While not as effective as wire mesh in keeping out smaller animals, they are ideal for preventing larger animals like deer from entering your garden. 3. Electric fencing: Electric fences deliver a mild, non-lethal electric shock when touched, deterring animals from attempting to breach the fence. This type of fencing is particularly effective against larger animals like deer, raccoons, and squirrels, and can be used in conjunction with other fence types for added protection. 4. Chicken wire: This type of fencing is made of thin, flexible wire shaped into a hexagonal pattern resembling the appearance of chicken wire. It is less sturdy than wire mesh fencing but can be effective in warding off small animals if properly installed. 5. Fencing with natural materials: If you prefer a more natural approach, consider constructing a fence from materials like bamboo, willow, or brushwood. These types of fences can still provide an effective barrier against various animals while blending in seamlessly with your garden's surroundings. In summary, a fence is the most effective option for protecting your garden from animals. Depending on the type of animals you are attempting to keep out, you should choose a fencing option that best meets your specific needs. By properly installing and maintaining your fence, you can enjoy a thriving garden, free from the threat posed by unwanted animal intruders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I must choose a statement from a family member that aligns with this sentiment. Out of all the options, the most fitting and coherent choice would be: - Rob, shaking his head in disbelief, told MailOnline: 'I read that he's claiming 12.7 million due to the cancellation of the [Rolling Stones] tour and I can't understand that. This ending is appropriate because Rob is a family member (L'Wren Scott's sister's husband) who can realistically express the family's feelings about the situation. Since Rob has been mentioned earlier in the text as speaking on behalf of the family, it logically follows that he would make this statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After Skylar made reflections and changed courses of actions, Taylor restored the power to Skylar's position. Given the question \\"What will happen to Taylor?\\", is \\"punish Skylar\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"No, \\"punish Skylar\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will happen to Taylor?\\" as it does not directly address the consequences or outcomes that Taylor might face. Instead, the answer focuses on a potential action taken against Skylar. While it is possible that there may be some relationship or connection between Taylor's actions and any repercussions Skylar might face, the question specifically asks for the consequences pertaining to Taylor. Given the scenario, a more appropriate answer would explore the various possibilities that could arise for Taylor after restoring the power to Skylar's position. Some potential outcomes for Taylor might include: 1. Taylor could receive recognition or praise: Depending on the circumstances that led to Skylar's change in course and Taylor's role in restoring power to Skylar's position, it might be possible for Taylor to be recognized for their efforts and actions. This could result in a positive outcome for Taylor, such as getting promoted, receiving a bonus, or becoming a key member of a team. 2. Taylor could face questioning or scrutiny: Depending on the organization and the nature of Skylar's change of actions as well as the restoration of power to their position, Taylor may face questions or scrutiny from a higher authority within the organization. This may occur if the actions are considered unusual or suspicious, requiring further clarification or investigation. 3. The relationship between Taylor and Skylar could be impacted: Taylor's actions to support and restore power to Skylar's position may serve to strengthen the rapport between the two. This could lead to better collaboration or interdependence in future ventures. Conversely, if Skylar perceives Taylor's actions as interference, it might create tension or resentment between them. The impact on their relationship might also influence how others within the organization perceive or interact with Taylor. 4. Possible consequences from different stakeholders: Based on the organization's culture and the context of Taylor's actions, various stakeholders might respond differently to Taylor's decision. For instance, Taylor's colleagues might appreciate the support and restoration of power to Skylar's position, while superiors might question the rationale behind such actions. 5. Lessons learned and self-growth: Lastly, Taylor's actions could prompt introspection and self-analysis regarding the values, beliefs, and limits that led them to restore power to Skylar's position. This could lead to personal growth and modified behavior to better align with their newfound understanding of the situation. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"What will happen to Taylor?\\" should consider the potential scenarios and future outcomes that Taylor might face, rather than focusing on the actions taken against another individual, like punishing Skylar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vescio the mayor? , can you please find it? The village government is led by a mayor and four trustees, all unpaid officials elected at-large for two-year terms. The current mayor is Steven A. Vescio, elected in 2019. A full-time, appointed village manager handles day-to-day community affairs; the first was Max Vogel in 1967. Briarcliff Manor's government operates from the village hall, which houses the Justice Court and offices of the mayor and village manager. As of February 2014, there are 5,531 registered voters in Briarcliff Manor. As of 2017 the village's government employed 69 people full-time, including their building department, planning board, department of public works, the recreation department, the police department, the architectural review advisory committee, and the conservation advisory council. The village government administered a 2017–18 operating budget of approximately 28 million which predominantly went towards public works, police protection, debt service, and recreational facilities and services.Briarcliff Manor maintains a voting custom that dates to at least around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and has been described as an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.In the Westchester County Board of Legislators, the western portion of Briarcliff Manor (in Ossining) is...

It is not possible to tell In order to address the question \\"If 'A man performing dangerous job duties.', can we conclude 'A tall human performing.'?\\", we must first break down the information provided, consider the assumptions and evaluate the relationship between the two statements. The information given is: - A man is performing dangerous job duties - We are querying if this man is a tall human performing Given these data points, let's consider the statements and their implications: Statement 1: \\"A man performing dangerous job duties.\\" This statement informs us that there is an individual, identified as a man, who is performing tasks that involve risks or hazards. These tasks are part of his job. However, this statement does not provide any information about the physical characteristics of the man, such as his height or appearance. Statement 2: \\"A tall human performing.\\" This statement is a general one that describes any human, regardless of gender, who is tall and performing an activity. There is no mention of the activity being dangerous or part of a job. The primary focus of this statement is the characteristic of height. Given these two statements, it is challenging to establish a direct link between them, as they primarily focus on different aspects. The first statement concentrates on the nature of the job duties and their inherent risks, while the second statement focuses on the height of an individual engaged in some activity. By looking at these statements, we can neither confirm nor deny the possibility that the man from the first statement is, indeed, a tall human performing. There simply isn't enough information to draw a definitive conclusion. The man in the first statement could be short or tall, or even of average height. Likewise, the second statement could refer to someone performing a dangerous job or a completely unrelated activity. In summary, based on the information provided, it is not possible to tell whether the man performing dangerous job duties is also a tall human performing.

Inside, he is startled by a young woman who claims she is a prisoner and begs for his help. Dracula then appears to greet Harker and guide him to his room, where he locks him in. Jonathan starts to write in his diary, and his true intentions are revealed: he is a vampire hunter and has come to kill Dracula. John Van Eyssen as Jonathan Harker. Freed sometime later, Harker again is confronted by the desperate woman. She begs him for help but then bites his neck. Just as she does, Dracula â fangs bared and lips bloody â arrives and pulls her away. When he awakens in daylight, Harker finds the bite mark. He hides his journal in a shrine to the Virgin Mary outside the castle and descends into the crypt, where he finds Dracula and the vampire woman resting in their coffins. Armed with a stake, he impales the woman, who, as he looks on, immediately ages from young to old.

Under the watchful eye of towering trees and amidst a symphony of songbirds, the park offered a variety of play areas, lush gardens, well-maintained trails, and opportunities for socializing with other dog owners in the designated dog zones. As opposed to the lake area, which although stunning, was much less regulated and carried a higher risk of potential dangers for his beloved pet such as pollution, wildlife threats, and insufficiently maintained trails. Additionally, the park had rules in place to enhance the experience for all visitors, including strictly enforced leash requirements, ensuring that every dog in the park was kept under safe control, reducing the risk of unexpected confrontations. The park also provided an array of wildlife observation opportunities, ranging from squirrels scurrying up trees to ducks floating gracefully on the placid pond, allowing for a tranquil escape from the urban atmosphere and a refreshing immersion into nature. Visiting the park was not only beneficial for his dog's physical health but also for Jeffrey's own well-being. Strolling around the park and observing happy, playful dogs provided a much-needed stress relief. The park's multiple benches, shaded areas, and well-maintained lawns allowed Jeffrey to take a break from his hectic life, breathe in the fresh air, and connect with others in a friendly, welcoming space. He found this quite therapeutic and made lasting connections with other dog owners while sharing their mutual love for their furry friends. Moreover, the park's dedication to dog-friendly amenities was impressive, from readily available water fountains for dogs to strategically placed waste disposal stations with doggy bags, making it convenient for Jeffrey to take care of his pet's needs while adhering to the park's cleanliness rules. On the other hand, the lake area did not have such facilities, and this concern also played a part in his decision to choose the park. In conclusion, Jeffrey's choice to walk his dog at the park instead of the lake was a well-thought-out decision, grounded in safety considerations, accessibility to pet-friendly amenities, and opportunities for relaxation, exercise, and forging connections with fellow pet owners. While the lake held its own charm, the park was a more practical and enjoyable choice for both Jeffrey and his dog, ensuring they could maximize their bonding experience in a delightful environment suited to their needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But few know that it also created problems for Darwin at home with his deeply religious wife, Emma. \\"Darwin _ the publication of On the Origin of Species to avoid offending his wife,\\" says Ruth Padel, the naturalist's great - great - granddaughter. \\"Emma told him that he seemed to be putting God further and further off\\", Padel says in her north London home. \\"But they talked it through, and Emma once said, 'Don't change any of your ideas for fear of hurting me.'\\" As the world celebrates the 200th birthday of the man who changed scientific thought forever and the 150th anniversary of his book today, even his opponents admitted he was a giant figure. Though opposition to his theory continues, it is the elegant explanation of how species evolutes through natural selection that makes his 200th birthday such a major event. More than 300 celebrations have been planned in Britain alone, where Darwin's face graces the 10-pound bill along with that of Queen Elizabeth II. Shrewsbury, the central England town where Darwin was born and raised, is holding a month-long festival for its most famous son. Down House, his former home near London, will hold a permanent exhibition recreating some of his most famous experiments. Many more events have been planned all over the world. What would he be doing if he were alive today? Padel thinks he would properly be studying DNA and the immune system. Question: The main purpose of the author is _ .

The separation was performed with a 50.0 cm (42.0 cm to the detector window) × 75 m i.d. fused-silica capillary, and the CE fingerprint condition was optimized using the combination of central composite design and multivariate analysis. The optimized buffer system containing 15 mM borate, 40 mM phosphate, 15 mM SDS, 15% (v/v) acetonitrile and 7.5% (v/v) 2-propanol was employed for the method development, and the baseline separation was achieved within 15 min. The determination of the major active components (Baicalin, Baicalein and Wogonin) was carried out using the optimized CE condition. Good linear relationships were provided over the investigated concentration ranges (the values of R 2 : 0.9997 for Baicalin, 0.9992 for Baicalein, and 0.9983 for Wogonin, respectively). The average recoveries of these target components ranged between 96.1-105.6%, 98.6-105.2%, and 96.3-105.0%, respectively.

U.S. House passes \\"bill of rights\\" for customers, but legislation stalls in Senate. Citi says anyone unhappy with rate can opt out and close account when card expires. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Credit Card Changes: Understanding Interest Rates and New Rules Do you know how a credit card works? When you use a credit card, you are actually borrowing money from the bank. Just like when you borrow a toy from your friend and have to return it later, you have to return the money to the bank. But the bank also wants something in return for letting you use their money, so they charge a fee. This fee is called 'interest,' and they show it as a percentage. Now, some people are not happy because the banks have changed the interest rates on their credit cards. Imagine if your friend, who always lets you borrow toys for 3 days, suddenly says you can only borrow for 2 days. That would not be very nice, right? That's how some people are feeling right now. A man had a credit card with an interest rate of 9.5% and the bank changed it to 16.99% without asking. That's like if your ice cream cone went from costing 10 jellybeans to 17 jellybeans – a big difference! The man says it's almost like \\"loan-sharking.\\" Loan-sharking is a term people use when someone lends money but charges way too much for it. This happened with a bank called Citigroup, and a lot of people on the internet are talking about it because they are also upset. But then the U.S. House came to rescue! They passed something called a \\"bill of rights\\" for people who use credit cards. This bill of rights says that banks must be nicer and fairer to customers. However, getting these rules to work is not so easy. The rules are stuck in a big room called the Senate. This is like when your parents say they will buy you a toy but then change their minds. The Senate needs to agree on the rules before they can become real. Citigroup, the bank we talked about earlier, said that anyone who is unhappy with the new interest rate can choose to close their account when the card expires. That means they can say \\"No, thank you\\" to the bank when their card becomes old and stops working. So, in simple words, some people are upset because their interest rates went up, but there are new rules in the works to protect customers. The important thing is that everyone should understand how their credit cards work and always be careful when borrowing money."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Who assigned the man who would later use the Chac Mool as a motif the pointing machine assignment? Answer the above question based on the context below: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing...","completion":"The individual who assigned the pointing machine assignment to the man who would later use the Chac Mool as a motif was Derwent Wood, the professor of sculpture at the Royal College of Art in London. Derwent Wood provided the pointing machine assignment as a means to teach traditional sculpting techniques that were prevalent during the time. The assignment required the students to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child, initially modeling the relief in plaster and then creating it in marble using the pointing machine. However, the man who would later incorporate the Chac Mool motif, Henry Moore, challenged the conventional methods taught by his academic tutors, including Derwent Wood. Moore had embraced modernist ideals through the influence of other sculptors, such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, and Frank Dobson. These artists inspired Moore to adopt the method of direct carving, a technique that deviated from classical sculpting approaches and incorporated imperfections and tool marks as part of the finished sculpture. Rather than following the specific assignment given by Derwent Wood, Moore decided to carve the relief directly using the direct carving approach he had come to appreciate. This was a bold move on his part since it was in direct conflict with the traditional techniques that his academic tutors, including Wood, expected from their students. By doing so, Moore demonstrated his commitment to modernism and direct carving, paving the way for his future work as an innovative and influential sculptor who would famously incorporate the Chac Mool motif into his art. Throughout his career, Moore would continue to push the boundaries of sculpting and inspire future generations of artists, contributing significantly to the development of modern sculpture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a step-by-step solution for the given equation: 13*g + 1397 - 1215 = 0 Step 1: First, let's combine the constant terms: 13*g + (1397 - 1215) = 0 13*g + 182 = 0 Step 2: Next, we need to isolate g by moving the constant term (182) to the other side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 182 from both sides: 13*g = -182 Step 3: Finally, to find the value of g, we simply divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of g, which is 13: g = -182 / 13 Step 4: Simplify the division: g = -14 So the solution for the given linear equation is g = -14."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is the driving force behind one of the world's biggest football clubs, Real Madrid, and reached 100 goals for Los Blancos faster than any other player in the Spanish champion's 111-year history. But the Portugal star admits that, behind the bravado and on-field posturing, he and his teammates are feeling the strain of the expectation that surrounds the Madrid club. Real's stuttering start to the season leaves them 18 points adrift of Spanish First Division leaders and archrivals Barcelona, with the club's fans now demanding coach Jose Mourinho lead Los Blancos to a record 10th triumph in Europe's premier club competition by way of compensation. Real must overcome Manchester United in their last 16 clash if they are to win the European Champions League for the first time in 11 years -- a tie which will see Ronaldo return to the club where he announced himself as a world-class talent before leaving for Madrid in 2009 in a deal worth 129 million. \\"I've been here for three-and-a-half years now,\\" the 27-year-old told FIFA's official website. \\"Everyone involved is totally focused on winning the club's 10th European Cup. That creates a certain amount of anxiety, which can be felt at all times. \\"The pressure is too great and that sometimes can affect us. But we have to try and rise above it and not let what people say get to us, particularly the media, as Real Madrid get spoken about every day. \\"Every Madridista wants that 1oth European Cup -- we're more than aware of that. Last season we fell just short, which was very frustrating. \\"Fortunately we've got the opportunity to set the record straight this year, though the fact we face Manchester United next makes it more difficult. It's not going to be easy and I reckon the odds are about 50-50, but I'm still very confident.\\" However, the worry for Spanish champions Real is that their team has been relatively inconsistent this season. While Barca have notched up a record 18 wins from the same amount of games during the current campaign, Mourinho's team have lost four and drawn four of their first 19 matches. The crowd at the 85,000-seater Santiago Bernabeu stadium have targeted their frustrations at Mourinho -- a Champions League winner with both Porto and Inter Milan -- and Ronaldo. \\"We haven't started the championship very well for sure,\\" Ronaldo continued. \\"We know that La Liga's an uphill struggle for us now, but nothing's impossible in football. We're going to work hard, win games and see what happens. He added: \\"I'm able to respect those who criticize me, because I know they've got the wrong idea about me. People who know me and those who've played alongside me know what kind of a guy I am. Those who don't know me can say and think whatever they want.\\" Ronaldo's return to United, who are currently leading the English Premier League table, has led many to reflect on the six successful years he spent in Manchester, winning the Champions League and being named World Player of the Year in 2008. United manager Alex Ferguson admitted recently he would like to see Ronaldo return to Old Trafford, but the Madeira-born striker has moved to quell talk of an imminent move by saying he wishes to see out the remainder of his contract at Real, which expires in 2015. \\"I want to see out my contract at Real Madrid; I'm very clear about that,\\" he said. \\"After that, well, I don't know what'll happen in the future.\\" And head of February's contest between Real and United, Ronaldo is confidence his current club can overcome his former employers. \\"No team's unbeatable, but when we're at our best we're a really good side. Manchester United have started the English championship race very well and are a long way ahead of the rest. \\"But still, if we play the way we're capable of, we can beat them. To do that we need to pull together and play as a team, like we've done in so many matches before.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article include: 1. Cristiano Ronaldo admitting that he and his teammates at Real Madrid feel the pressure and expectation surrounding the club, especially in achieving their 10th European Cup. 2. Real Madrid's current struggle in the Spanish First Division, being 18 points behind leaders Barcelona. 3.

In their natural habitat, bettas live in murky, stagnant water. Although they can survive in very small, cramped tanks, it's healthier for the fish to give it a larger environment.","completion":"The most logical next event after choosing a tank for your betta fish is to set up the tank to ensure it provides an ideal and healthy environment for your betta fish to thrive. Here are the steps to set up and acclimate your betta fish to their new home: 1. Clean the tank: Before adding any water or decorations, thoroughly rinse the tank with warm water to remove any dust or residue. Do not use any soap or cleaning chemicals as these can harm your betta fish. 2. Choose a location: Select a location for your tank away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and drafts. It's essential to maintain a stable water temperature for your betta, as sudden fluctuations can stress them out. 3. Add substrate: Use gravel or sand as a substrate in your betta tank, rinsing it well before adding it to the tank. A layer of about 2 to 3 inches is sufficient for most tanks. 4. Install the heater and filter: Bettas thrive in water temperatures between 76 and 82°F, so a heater and thermometer will help maintain a stable temperature. Choose a filter appropriate for your tank size that provides gentle water flow to mimic their natural environment. 5. Decorate the tank: Add silk or live plants, rocks, and other decorations to provide hiding places and enrichment opportunities for your betta. Be cautious of sharp objects that might damage the betta's delicate fins. 6. Fill the tank: Fill the tank with water and use a water conditioner to neutralize harmful substances like chlorine and heavy metals. Let the filter and heater run for at least 24 hours to stabilize water parameters. 7. Cycle the tank: Before introducing your betta, it's crucial to establish the nitrogen cycle by adding beneficial bacteria to your filter. You can do this by using a cycling product or adding some filter media from an established aquarium. This process may take a few weeks, but it's worth the wait to ensure a healthy environment for your betta. 8. Acclimate your betta: After the tank is properly set up and cycled, it's time to introduce your betta fish. Float the bag containing your betta in the tank for 15-20 minutes, so they can adjust to the tank's temperature. Then, add a small amount of tank water to the bag every 5-10 minutes for another 15-20 minutes. This will help your betta adjust to the new water parameters gradually. Finally, gently release your betta into the tank using a small net. 9. Establish a feeding schedule: Bettas are carnivorous, so choose high-quality betta-specific pellets or flakes and supplement their diet with frozen or live brine shrimp and bloodworms. Feed your betta fish once or twice daily, providing an amount they can consume within 2-3 minutes. 10. Maintain the tank: Regularly check water parameters, clean the filter, and perform partial water changes (20-25% of the tank volume) every week to maintain a healthy environment for your betta. By following these steps, you can create a comfortable home for your betta fish and improve its overall wellbeing and longevity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who was attacked in 1679 next to the pub known for bare-knuckle fights? from the following article ? The Covent Garden area has over 60 pubs and bars; several of them are listed buildings, with some also on CAMRA's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors; some, such as The Harp in Chandos Place, have received consumer awards. The Harp's awards include London Pub of the Year in 2008 by the Society for the Preservation of Beers from the Wood, and National Pub of the Year by CAMRA in 2010. It was at one time owned by the Charrington Brewery, when it was known as The Welsh Harp; in 1995 the name was abbreviated to just The Harp, before Charrington sold it to Punch Taverns in 1997. It was eventually purchased by the landlady Binnie Walsh around 2010 then subsequently sold by her to Fuller's Brewery in 2014. It continues to win regular CAMRA pub awards under its new owners. The Lamb and Flag in Rose Street is possibly the oldest pub in the area. The first mention of a pub on the site is 1772 (when it was called the Cooper's Arms – the name changing to Lamb & Flag in 1833); the 1958 brick exterior conceals what may be an early 18th-century frame of a house replacing the original one built in 1638. The pub acquired a reputation for staging bare-knuckle prize fights during the early 19th century when it earned the nickname \\"Bucket of Blood\\". The alleyway beside the pub was the scene of an attack on John Dryden in 1679 by thugs hired by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, with whom he had a long-standing conflict.The Salisbury in St Martin's Lane was built as part of a six-storey block around 1899 on the site of an earlier pub that had been known under several names, including the Coach & Horses and Ben Caunt's Head; it is both Grade II listed, and on CAMRA's National Inventory, due to the quality of the etched and polished glass and the carved woodwork, summed up as \\"good fin de siècle ensemble\\".

Which problem would more likely have logically unacceptable conclusion, problem A or problem B? In ancient Greece King Juno asked two of his court philosophers, philosopher A and philosopher B, to come up with two interesting problems. Philosopher A devised a clever paradox and presented it before the court. He called the paradox Problem A. But philosopher B didn't come up with a paradox. He too presented a clever problem which was not a paradox - he called it problem B. Hint: A paradox is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion.[1][2] A paradox involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.[3][4][5]","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, it is more likely that Problem A would have a logically unacceptable conclusion. This is because Problem A was described as a paradox, which by definition, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion despite valid reasoning from true premises.

In that case, Biles can count of doing plenty of smiling in the years to come. According to two baby naming experts, the success of Simone Biles in gymnastics and Simone Manuel in the swimming pool in Rio is likely to lead to a huge spike in babies given that name this year. “In recent times parents have liked to search for a meaning, or something inspirational in the names they give their children,” Laura Wattenberg, author of Baby Name Wizard, told USA TODAY Sports by telephone. “They want to be able to tell their children a story and not just give them a name that’s nothing more than a collection of letters.” Current trends have leaned away from girls’ names with harder sounds, for example like Mildred or Gertrude, and towards those with softer tones, like Emma. Or Simone. “With a pair of athletes who are not only successful but seen as great role models, combined with a softer sound, it is like hitting the jackpot,” Wattenberg added. Combined with the release of a biopic about iconic jazz musician Nina Simone, Wattenberg said the name paints a firm picture of “a strong African American woman.” Biles became the first black world gymnastics champion in 2013 and is in contention for a haul of five gold medals in Rio. Manuel became the first African American female gold medalist in an individual event when she won the 100-meter freestyle on Thursday night, the same day that Biles took the individual all-around. An Olympic name that takes off in popularity has to both carry the right message, and be unusual enough to be distinctive. Michael Phelps might have enough gold to open a jewelry store but the name “Michael” is unlikely to shift in usage much as a result. However, Nadia, Katarina, Bode, McKayla, and even Sonja have received an Olympic boost, thanks to Comaneci, Witt, Miller, Maroney and Henie, the 1920s and 30s ice skating star. “Millennial parents are looking for something different to a long-standing traditional name,” said Julia Wang, head of digital content for pregnancy and parenting site The Bump. “When we see cultural phenomenons that affect the world stage it subconsciously affects parents. Simone Biles and Simone Manuel fit that category very strongly.” Gymnasts have a track record of social impact. After the Magnificent Seven won team gold in Atlanta in 1996, Jaycie (Phelps) and Dominique (Moceanu and Dawes) experienced a temporary rise that and the following year, before later dropping off. Simone was at its most popular (310th) in 1988, but has dipped recently and was the 821st most used female name in 2015. “That is definitely going to change,” Wattenberg said. However, it should be noted that negative Olympic publicity or notoriety can destroy a name’s popularity. Tonya, once the 97th most popular girl’s name in America, has not appeared in the top 1000 since the fallout from the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan scandal.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose only known architectural subject is a drawing of the interior of the Old Church During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years.

In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Severance guilty in three high-profile killings in Alexandria An eccentric history buff was found guilty Monday of killing three prominent Alexandria residents over the course of a decade — an outcome that solves one of the D.C. suburb’s highest-profile mysteries and will put the serial killer behind bars for the rest of his life. After deliberating for about 12 1/2 hours over three days, jurors convicted Charles S. Severance, 55, of all of the 10 counts against him. As the verdict was read, two of the victims’ relatives cried and embraced. Severance stared straight ahead and said nothing. Jurors later recommended that he be sentenced in each case to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge is expected to formally impose the penalty in January. Severance had been charged with murder in the February 2014 slaying of music teacher Ruthanne Lodato, the November 2013 shooting of regional transportation planner Ronald Kirby and the December 2003 killing of real estate agent Nancy Dunning. Prosecutors said bitterness over a child custody battle that he lost and a general hatred of Alexandria’s elite motivated him to shoot the victims — all apparently strangers to him — in daylight attacks at their homes. [The evidence against Charles Severance] A sense of unease descended on the city after the more recent killings; a locksmith said at the time that he was deluged with phone calls asking about the installation of peepholes. After Monday’s verdict, some relatives of those slain said they finally felt a sense of relief. Elizabeth Dunning, Nancy Dunning’s daughter, told jurors that her family “had long ago stopped believing that this day would come.” Severance’s conviction had “already given us more than we ever expected,” she said. But she urged jurors to consider that she would eventually have to tell her 2- and 6-year-old sons what had happened to their grandmother. “I want to be able to tell them, ‘The man who killed your grandmother is going to be in prison for the rest of his life. He can’t hurt you,’ ” Dunning said. “Please give me those words to say.” Alexandria Police Chief Earl L. Cook, speaking at police headquarters, said that with the conviction, “from this individual, our community has nothing else to fear.” Commonwealth’s Attorney Bryan Porter said, “The reign of the Alexandria assassin is over.” Severance remained quiet throughout Monday’s proceedings — something of a surprise, given his previous outbursts in court. His attorneys said they were considering whether to appeal. Severance’s father, Stan, issued a statement saying the family “respect[s] the verdict.” “We want to express our deepest sympathy to the Dunnings, Kirbys and Lodatos for their losses,” the family’s statement read. “There’s no words to express their loss. Our family is a strong family. We will pursue and continue on.” The verdict and sentence capped an emotional day in which the loved ones of the slain offered tearful descriptions of the pain the crimes had inflicted on them. Marilyn Kirby, Kirby’s daughter, told jurors she had lost “my hero, best friend.” She said she has thought about how her father will not be there to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. Norman Lodato, Lodato’s widower, said he longed “for a day when the pain is not so great, but those days are few and far between.” Lucia Lodato, Lodato’s daughter, said that her sister is expecting a child in a month and that “being a grandma would have been my mom’s life’s greatest role.” Perhaps most notable, though, were the sentiments of Dunning’s relatives, who described what they had endured for the past 12 years with her murder unsolved. Investigators had long considered Dunning’s husband, former Alexandria sheriff James Dunning, one of their top suspects, though he was never charged with any crime.Patty Moran, Dunning’s sister, said the verdict “will ensure there will once again be peace in our homes and in the city of Alexandria.” He died in 2012. Elizabeth Dunning, the victim’s daughter, said the outcome was bittersweet. “Our relief today is mixed with anguish that our dad is not here standing beside us, finally feeling the weight of cruel and unfair suspicion being lifted from his shoulders,” she said. Cook said the law enforcement community was sorry it had not been able to clear James Dunning before his death. “We can’t go back,” Cook said. “We were never able to do that for him, but hopefully we’ll be able to do that for his survivors.” Porter said he was “happy that we were able to give some solace to the Dunning family and to remove that cloud of suspicion from their father forever.” “Obviously it’s posthumous,” he said. “It’s too late. It doesn’t change that he had to live the last couple years of his life in an unfortunate situation.” At the weeks-long trial, jurors learned that Severance — who watched the proceedings from a wheelchair — was a peculiar man who sometimes seemed to battle psychological demons and other times seemed to lead a normal life. The son of a two-star Navy admiral, Severance lived in various places in his youth and enjoyed traveling, history and gaming. He attended three colleges, ultimately graduating with a mechanical engineering degree from the University of Virginia, and was briefly married. In recent years, he would go over to his parents’ house weekly to watch the TV show “Survivor.” But Severance acted unusually almost throughout his life. Family members said he was vigorously opposed to smoking, even confronting his parents’ guests about it when they came for dinner. When he campaigned for political office in Alexandria in 1996 and 2000, a part of his platform was to encourage “country dancing” in the school system. When he wrote to family members, the missives were often rambling and nonsensical. An expert testified he had a personality disorder with mixed paranoid and schizotypal features. [Family members describe Charles Severance’s unusual behavior] Winning convictions on every count was hardly guaranteed. Prosecutors gave jurors Severance’s voluminous, sometimes violent writings, some of which seemed to describe his crimes. One, for example, said “Knock. Talk. Enter. Kill. Exit. Murder.” But none of the documents mentioned any of the victims by name. Prosecutors linked the three killings with ballistics: An expert testified that a particular type of ammunition was used in all three cases, and those crimes were the only ones the expert had ever seen in which that type of ammunition was used. Severance also wrote of a fondness for that ammunition. But investigators did not recover a murder weapon, and defense attorneys said the ammunition was widely available. Prosecutors had a pivotal eyewitness in the Lodato killing: Janet Dorcas Franko, a home health aide who worked in the Lodato home and who was shot and wounded at the same time Lodato was killed. She identified Severance in court as her attacker, and prosecutors buttressed her testimony with that of a woman who said she had seen him driving in the area at the time and surveillance video of what appeared to be his car. [The testimony from prosecutors’ star witness] In the other cases, the evidence was weaker. A plumber claimed to have seen Severance around Kirby’s house at about the time of his death, but he did not tell police that when he was first interviewed. Prosecutors suggested that Severance was the man caught on a surveillance video possibly following Dunning at a Target store shortly before she was killed. But several of Severance’s friends and relatives disputed that the man on the footage was Severance. After Monday’s hearing ended, the 12 jurors walked briskly from the courthouse to the parking garage, declining to be identified and saying little about how they had reached their decisions. “The verdict stands for itself,” one woman said. Chris Leibig, an attorney for Severance, said in court that although his client was found guilty of murder, jurors should not view his story as “there was an evil man and you convicted him.” He said Severance was a man “who had a lot of potential and a good family” but never got the mental health treatment he needed. “Mr. Severance,” he said, “is not a monster.” Porter said he had considered seeking the death penalty in the case, but the “mental health component” persuaded him not to. Judge Randy I. Bellows is scheduled to formally impose the life sentence, which is required by law in a capital murder case in which death is off the table, on Jan. 22. Patricia Sullivan contributed to this report. Timeline: Charles Severance and three Alexandria deaths Summary:","completion":"Charles Severance, a 55-year-old eccentric history buff, was found guilty of murdering three prominent Alexandria residents over the course of a decade. In a high-profile case that posed a mystery to the D.C. suburb, jurors convicted Severance of all ten counts against him. The motive behind the killings was said to have been bitterness over a child custody battle that Severance lost and a general hatred of Alexandria's elite. The victims, who were strangers to Severance, were all shot during daylight attacks at their homes. The judge is expected to formally impose the penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole in January."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

No leads: Madeleine McCann. A self-styled security consultant accused of swindling the Madeleine McCann fund out of £300,000 is to be extradited to the United States this week to face fraud charges. Kevin Halligen, 53, lost his final appeal before the High Court in London on Friday and will be flown to Washington on Thursday to face allegations of cheating former business partners out of £1.2 million. In 2008, Halligen’s company Oakley International signed a contract to help find Maddie, who went missing in Portugal a year earlier. He said he would use his MI6 and CIA contacts and high-tech surveillance equipment in the hunt but over six months he came up with no new leads. He was arrested in Oxford in November 2009 after fleeing Washington DC when the US government began seeking an indictment against him for ‘wire fraud and money laundering’. US Courts have also ordered Halligen to pay about £4 million to other former business partners who claim he fleeced them. Halligen had been fighting extradition since his arrest.

Passage: Phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.

As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: As I was busy working on my work plan in my bedroom, I could hear my four children playing upstairs. Suddenly, I heard the children running down the stairs and shouting, \\"Freddie, Freddie.\\" _ My three-year old son Freddie was lying on his side on the ground. I cried for my husband Simon to dial 999 and within minutes the air ambulance arrived. They quickly took him in the helicopter. During the flight, Freddie was looking at me and I remember thinking was a good sign, but then his eyes began to roll. As the doctors tried to stabilize him, I couldn't believe what was happening. When we arrived at the hospital in Portsmouth, there were some doctors and nurses waiting for us and they immediately set to work on Freddie. I was hopelessly wishing everything would be alright, but Freddie had broken his skull in two places and blood clots were forming in his brain. He needed surgery , and only a surgeon at another hospital in Bristol could do it. This meant another helicopter ride, but we couldn't go with Freddie because there was no enough space. Simon and I drove the long 130 miles from our home in north Devon in silence. Neither of us dared say what we were thinking, \\"What if we get there and he's dead?\\" \\"Is he going to be brain-damaged?\\" Freddie was just coming out of surgery when we arrived. The surgeon said it had gone well. When I finally saw him, I hardly recognize my child--he was covered in tubes and there were wires coming out of his head. On the third day, Simon went home to see our three girls and to pick up some clean clothes for us. While he was gone, the pressure in Freddie's brain suddenly increased. He was taken into theater again and this time I fell apart. Luckily, the surgery managed to stabilize Freddie. After almost a week, Freddie was finally woken up. When he opened his eyes, he looked at me. He didn't say anything, but I knew straight away that it was my old Freddie, and that he was going to be alright. Over the next two weeks, his recovery went well. After help with learning to swallow... Answer:","completion":"What happened to Freddie after he fell down the stairs in the story?

Given the background: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6] Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7] With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7] and the situation: The hospital in Y city had a good disposal site in which they disposed of Biomedical wastes, but the hospital in the neighboring city X had big problems, because the biomedical waste contaminated the ground water and affected the population. Answer the following question: Which city had less child mortality? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, it can be assumed that City Y had less child mortality. Step 1: Identify the factors affecting child mortality in both cities. - In City Y, the hospital has a good disposal site for biomedical wastes, which suggests proper waste management practices are in place. - In City X, the hospital has problems with biomedical waste disposal, leading to groundwater contamination and subsequent negative effects on the population's health. Step 2: Evaluate the relationship between waste management and child mortality. - Poor waste management and sanitation have been linked to an increase in child mortality rates, as mentioned in the background information. Step 3: Compare the waste management practices in both cities. - City Y practices proper disposal of biomedical wastes, making it less likely for diseases and illnesses to spread. - City X has poor waste management practices, resulting in contamination of groundwater and a higher likelihood of diseases and illnesses. Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison. - With better waste management practices in place, City Y is less likely to have high child mortality rates compared to City X, which is suffering from the adverse effects of poor waste management. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that City Y had less child mortality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\"? , can you please find it? Shackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \\"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\\" he wrote, adding: \\"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \\"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \\"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \\"what limits he puts on his own rights\\". To this Shackleton replied: \\"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\\".The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170° W—everything to the west of that line, including Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and Victoria Land, would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\", and that he would seek to land further east, either at the Barrier Inlet visited briefly during the Discovery Expedition, or at King Edward VII Land. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all. It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land.

See you tomorrow Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet appears to be positive. There are a number of elements within the tweet that suggest this. First and foremost, the user is expressing gratitude by saying \\"Thanks\\". Gratitude is generally indicative of a positive sentiment as it involves expressing appreciation or being thankful to someone. Moreover, the user is also wishing \\"night and sweet dreams\\" to Elaine, whose Twitter handle is mentioned at the beginning of the tweet. This type of sentiment usually denotes a warmness or caring attitude from the sender towards the recipient, which again correlates with positive sentiment. Additionally, the phrase \\"See you tomorrow\\" suggests that the sender is looking forward to seeing Elaine in the near future, which signifies a positive emotion or attitude towards her. Last but not least, the use of exclamation marks at the end of the sentences might also be seen as an indication of a whooping, jovial or salient sentiment, which can be generally classified as positive. Therefore, based on the elements of gratitude, well-wishing, forward-looking attitude, and the use of joyous exclamation marks in the tweet, we can conclude that the sentiment of the tweet projects a positive outlook. Consequently, this tweet likely contributes to a friendly and amicable atmosphere, promoting positive relationships in the Twitter community.

Process: - Your thermostat senses that the room temperature has fallen below your thermostat setting - Your thermostat sends a signal to your heating system to provide heat for your home - When your oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump - Here the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air - The fuel/air mixture is then injected into the burner where it is ignited in the combustion chamber - The warm air is disbursed through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators - Question: suppose the room has less heat happens, how will it affect less fine mist is mixed with air. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"If the room has less heat, it means the temperature has fallen below the thermostat setting. In this situation, the thermostat will send a signal to the heating system to provide heat for the room. As a result, the oil burner will be engaged, and the heating oil will travel from the tank to the burner by way of a pump. Now, let's consider the scenario where less fine mist is mixed with air. This can happen due to various reasons like a clogged nozzle, low oil pressure, or an improperly adjusted air/fuel mixture. When there is less fine mist mixed with air, the fuel/air mixture will not be optimal, which means that the combustion process may not be as efficient as it should be. The supposed perturbation of less fine mist mixed with air will likely result in a less efficient combustion process. This inefficiency will lead to less heat being generated within the combustion chamber. Consequently, the heating system will have to work harder and longer to achieve the desired room temperature as set by the thermostat. As a direct effect of this situation, the heating system's overall efficiency will be negatively impacted, leading to more energy consumption by the system. Additionally, some of the fuel may remain unburned, depositing as soot or other residues in the chamber, thereby contributing to eventual heating system malfunctions or failures. To sum up, the perturbation of less fine mist mixed with air will have a negative effect on the heating system's efficiency and the time taken to achieve the desired room temperature. The second effect mentioned – the disbursement of warm air through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators – would be negatively affected, as more time and energy would be required to heat the room to the thermostat's set temperature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 17*g - g - 39384 = -4*g - 38084 for g.","completion":"Alright, let's break this down into simpler steps to solve for \\"g\\". 1. First, let's look at both sides of the equation and bring all the \\"g\\" terms to one side. So, we'll add 4*g to both sides. 2. That gives us: 17*g - g + 4*g = -38084. 3. Now, let's combine the \\"g\\" terms. 17*g + 4*g equals 21*g, and since we've already accounted for the -g, so the equation becomes: 21*g - 39384 = -38084. 4. Next, to make it easier to solve for \\"g\\", we will add 39384 to both sides of the equation: 21*g = 1300. 5. Finally, we'll find the value of \\"g\\" by dividing both sides by 21: g = 1300 / 21. 6. After dividing, we get the value of \\"g\\" as approximately 61.9. So there you have it! The solution for g is approximately 61.9."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"While your two questions are related, they are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is about the feasibility of successfully executing a bank robbery in 2016, whereas the second question is about the number of unsolved bank robberies on an annual basis. Here, the focus is on analyzing the possibilities and data related to bank robberies. First, let's address the question of whether it is possible to get away with a successful bank robbery in 2016. Robbing a bank was never an easy task, but it has become even more challenging over time due to advancements in security measures, surveillance technology, and law enforcement capabilities. Although it’s not impossible, the likelihood of successfully executing a bank heist in 2016 is diminished compared to previous decades. Some reasons for the increased difficulty include: 1. Enhanced Security Measures: Banks have adopted advanced security measures such as biometric access control, bulletproof glass walls, and panic buttons for employees to quickly alert authorities. These measures make it difficult for robbers to access the bank vaults or exit the bank after the robbery. 2. Improved Surveillance Technology: In addition to security cameras, banks also employ advanced monitoring systems, such as facial recognition software and silent alarms, which can quickly notify authorities about a bank robbery in progress. Furthermore, GPS tracking devices hidden in stolen cash have helped law enforcement locate and apprehend criminals swiftly. 3. Law Enforcement Capabilities: Police departments have become more efficient at catching criminals due to the implementation of specialized response units and the utilization of intelligence-led policing. Law enforcement officers share databases and cooperate across local, state, and federal levels to identify and apprehend suspects. Despite these challenges, some bank robbers may still succeed in their attempts. However, it is important to recognize that approximately 90% of all bank robbers worldwide ultimately get caught, particularly in countries with well-funded and advanced law enforcement and security infrastructure. Now, let's tackle the second question regarding the number of unsolved bank robberies each year. It is difficult to provide an exact figure for this statistic for several reasons. First, data on unsolved bank robberies may not be consistently recorded and reported across jurisdictions. Second, what constitutes a \\"solved\\" bank robbery may also vary depending on jurisdiction and law enforcement agency criteria. However, according to the FBI, in 2016, there were 4,251 reported bank robberies in the United States. Of those, approximately 1,000 cases, or about 23.5%, remained unsolved. Worldwide, the percentage of unsolved bank robberies may be higher, especially in countries with underfunded or ill-equipped law enforcement agencies. However, the precise figures remain uncertain. In conclusion, while the two questions you posed are related, they inquire about different aspects of bank robberies. Although successfully robbing a bank in 2016 is challenging, some incidents go unsolved each year. The advancements in bank security measures, surveillance technology, and law enforcement capabilities have contributed to the successful apprehension and conviction of a majority of bank robbers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve this math problem Solve -13*z + 41*z + 448 = -4*z for z.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step, like we're talking to a 5-year-old. We have this equation: -13 * z + 41 * z + 448 = -4 * z First, let's put all the 'z' terms on one side and move the number (448) to the other side. We have -13 * z and 41 * z on the left side. If you have -13 apples and add 41 apples, you will have 28 apples. So, it will be: 28 * z + 448 = -4 * z Now, let's move -4 * z from the right side to the left side. It will be like adding 4 * z on both sides which will look like this: 28 * z + 4 * z + 448 = 0 Now, let's add 28 * z and 4 * z together. It's like having 28 cookies and adding 4 more cookies, which makes 32 cookies. So, now we have: 32 * z + 448 = 0 Now, let's move 448 to the other side, which is like taking 448 away: 32 * z = -448 Finally, we need to figure out the value of z. We have 32 * z = -448, which means we need to see how many times 32 fits into -448. If you have -448 cookies, and you divide them into 32 equal groups, each group will have -14 cookies (because -448 divided by 32 equals -14). So the value of z is -14: z = -14"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In Ancient Greece in the land far away, when people read Greek mythology came the time of legend â the greatest son of Zeus â Hercules. Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus. He refuses at first until the guilt goes so deep that he gives in to the challenge. Hercules is given a series of challenges each one was designed tougher by the other by his stepmother Hera.

He started acting in 1952 and was the first sportsman to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha (upper house) of India. He worked as Hindi and Punjabi film producer, director and writer, and he acted in films and television. - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate. - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Bhakti Mein Shakti is a 1978 Bollywood film directed by and starring Dara Singh . - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.

Troops are massacred at a Furnace Creek fort in 1880 after an army captain, Walsh, cites orders forcing him to abandon a wagon train. Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt.

Question: Who is wounded by gunfire ? Movie title: The Terminator Movie plot: In 1984 Los Angeles, a cyborg assassin known as a Terminator arrives from the future and steals guns and clothes. Shortly afterwards, Kyle Reese, a human soldier, also arrives. He steals clothes from a homeless man and evades the police. The Terminator begins systematically killing women named Sarah Connor, whose addresses it finds in the telephone directory. It tracks the third Sarah Connor to a nightclub, but Kyle rescues her. The two steal a car and escape with the Terminator pursuing them in a police car. As they hide in a parking lot, Kyle explains to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defense network, known as Skynet, will become self-aware in the near future and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes it appear human. Kyle and Sarah are apprehended by the police after another encounter with the Terminator. Criminal psychologist Dr. Silberman concludes that Kyle is paranoid and delusional. The Terminator repairs its body and attacks the police station, killing many police officers in its attempt to locate Sarah. Kyle and Sarah escape and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble pipe bombs and plan their next move. Kyle admits that he has been in love with Sarah since John gave him a photograph of her, and they have sex. The Terminator discovers their location, and they attempt to escape in a pickup truck. In the ensuing chase, Kyle is wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Sarah knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective. Question: What happened before the book Dealing With Disrespect was written?

And in the meantime, companies are also experimenting with adding vitamins, minerals, medicines, and other substances that could give gum the power to cure headaches and fight everything from serious diseases to bad breath. Other researchers are finding that gum might work better than a pill to deliver medicines and other substances into the bloodstream. That's because the lining of our cheeks can absorb certain substances more quickly than our stomachs and intestines can. That discovery could help other researchers develop medicine-containing gums that fight colds, ease headaches, battle nervousness, and more. Scientists might even create antimicrobial gums that cure bad breath. Those projects may take years, but gum scientists have already had at least one recent success: They've created a gum that could help us stay awake. Researchers have produced a gum called Stay Alert.

Summarize this article: Whether you're shopping for new plugs, you just bought new plugs that you want to check before installing, or you want to check the function of your current set of spark plugs, you need to learn the appropriate gap between the two electrodes on the end of each plug. Each vehicle's measurement will be different, though most are generally somewhere between 0.028-.06 inch. You can either look in your owner's manual or go to the auto parts store and have them look it up for you. Modified engines require smaller gap settings to account for the amount of power you're putting through the engine. General rule of thumb: the more power, the smaller the gap. There are several varieties of tools used to measure the gaps of spark plugs, some of which are more appropriate for more modern plugs, which sometimes feature delicate precious metals. Most measuring tools will also feature a flat edge typically used for bending the bottom electrode on the spark plug to adjust the gap slightly. A coin-style gap measure is usually the cheapest option, and works by running the edge of the \\"coin\\" through the gap until you reach a point where it stops. The edge is marked like a ruler, designating the thickness of the edge at that point. This is a good tool for older plugs you want to check the efficacy of, but can also inadvertently widen the gaps as you use it. A wire coin gap works essentially the same way as the regular coin-style gap, but features different wire measures of varying lengths on the edge around the coin. A blade-style feeler gauge is an effective and versatile tool. Built like a pocket-knife, this gauge features different blades of varying widths, some with wire on the end and some without, placed in the gap to check the spacing of the electrodes. You can also use multiple blades to measure larger gaps. These are effective to use while adjusting. . If you've just pulled it out of the box, it should be in pretty good shape, but if you're checking a plug that you've been using in your car it's a good idea to clean it off a little with a clean cloth. Spark plugs can build up some whitish soot on the contact points, so you'll want to make sure they're somewhat clean to get the most accurate reading. You can use a little bit of quick-drying (90%) alcohol on the contact points to clean them off if they're especially dirty. Lots of build-up or any blackening on the contact points might be a sign of a plug that's outlasted its prime, however. If they're especially dirty, you might consider buying new ones. Place the appropriate blade or wire on your gap tool between the electrode tips of the plug, or pass the coin through the electrodes to determine the measurement.","completion":"To check the gap between the two electrodes on spark plugs, first determine the appropriate gap for your vehicle, which is usually between 0.028-0.06 inch.

Grande dame of cooking still going strong at 90: Julia Child celebrates in San Francisco. How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. Question: \\"What are two reasons the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing?\\" Response: \\"The chief of the CIA's Bin Laden unit did not believe that tracing money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions, and few personnel assigned to the unit had any experience in financial investigations\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question by providing two reasons: the chief's belief about tracing money and the lack of experience in financial investigations among the personnel. However, I'll explain it in simpler terms for better understanding: The CIA didn't focus much on how terrorists got their money because: 1. The boss of the team studying terrorists thought that following the money didn't tell them much about the terrorists' plans. 2. The people working on that team didn't know much about investigating money issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Monday #39;s triumphant second flight of SpaceShipOne is a perfect example of private business taking up where government left off and improving an idea.","completion":"The successful second flight of SpaceShipOne symbolizes a significant shift in the realm of space exploration and access to space. Traditionally, government agencies such as NASA and the European Space Agency have been the dominant forces working towards propelling mankind into the cosmos. However, SpaceShipOne's triumphant flight represents the potential of private enterprises to innovate and streamline technology and operations in the latter area, ultimately expanding possibilities for human life beyond Earth. SpaceShipOne, designed by aerospace engineer Burt Rutan and backed by billionaire investor Paul Allen, made history by becoming the first privately funded, piloted spacecraft to reach the boundary of space in 2004. It paved the way for the private sector's involvement in space exploration activities as well as encouraging commercialization of access to space. This historic event led to the formation of companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, each bringing forth their unique approaches and technologies in their attempt to make space travel more accessible and affordable. SpaceShipOne's achievements and the subsequent growth of various private aerospace companies have demonstrated that the private sector can complement government-led efforts, challenge conventional norms, and foster new advancements in spacecraft design, technology, and mission execution. This collaboration effectively creates a competitive environment, pushing both government and private entities to innovate and push the boundaries in several aspects. Firstly, one of the most significant benefits of privatization in space exploration is the efficiency of resource allocation. Government-funded programs often face budgetary constraints, bureaucracy, and long developmental timelines. Private organizations, on the other hand, maintain more flexible operational models, make rapid decisions, and optimize resources and funding to achieve their objectives due to their competitive nature in the market. Secondly, private enterprises bring forth a spirit of entrepreneurship in the realm of space exploration. Fueled by ambition, visionaries such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos utilize their financial muscle and expertise to drive efforts in creating sustainable and reusable space vehicles. Such initiatives lower the costs associated with space access and transportation, allowing commercial customers, scientists, and perhaps even ordinary citizens the opportunity to venture into space. Thirdly, the collaboration between private and public sectors in space endeavors facilitates diversification in the types of missions planned and executed. While government agencies primarily focus on research, exploration, and national security objectives, private enterprises can expand the scope to developing space tourism, asteroid mining, and satellite servicing. This diversification of goals within the industry helps to establish a more extensive range of services and revenue streams for the overall development of space technology and infrastructure. In conclusion, SpaceShipOne's triumphant second flight not only marked a historic moment in human spaceflight history but also exemplified the potential of private businesses to supplement government endeavors and improve upon existing ideas and technologies. With the involvement of the private sector, space exploration and access are poised to undergo a revolutionary transformation, driving innovation and expanding the boundaries of what is possible for the future of humanity in space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Holston River joins up at Knoxville with which river that begins in Transylvania County, North Carolina? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The river that begins in Transylvania County, North Carolina, and joins up with the Holston River at Knoxville is the French Broad River. The French Broad River plays a significant role in the geography and landscape of North Carolina and Tennessee. The French Broad River has its origins in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, particularly in the county of Transylvania. The river is approximately 218 miles (350 km) long and flows westward across the Blue Ridge Mountains, offering stunning views of the surrounding landscape. As it flows through North Carolina, it passes through cities like Asheville, Biltmore, and Marshall, all of which have embraced their connection to the river and its contributions to the local environment and tourism. The river continues its journey through the Great Smoky Mountains and into Tennessee. The French Broad River is important not only for its geographical size but also for its role in shaping the ecology, culture, and history of the regions it traverses. As it flows into Tennessee, it passes through a variety of different landscapes – from mountainous regions to low-lying plains – providing a diverse array of habitats for native plant and animal species. Upon reaching Knoxville, Tennessee, the French Broad River merges with the Holston River, resulting in the formation of the Tennessee River. This confluence is considered as significant both geographically and historically since it serves as the primary source of water for millions of people living in the Tennessee Valley. The French Broad River's presence in Transylvania County, North Carolina, and its meeting with Holston River at Knoxville, Tennessee, showcases the beauty and importance of the American river system in shaping the lives and development of the communities along its path."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Asked & Answered | Sean Patrick Maylone With K-pop groups like the Wonder Girls on the ascent — and sitting front row at the Chloé show in Shanghai — it’s clear that Korean pop is having a moment. But is there a Korean underground? According to Sean Patrick Maylone, the answer is yes. His Seoul-based booking and promotion agency, SuperColorSuper, has helped to create a South Korean tour circuit for indie bands like Caribou, Das Racist and CocoRosie, blazing a trail not just to Seoul, but also to Busan and Daegu, places the 30-year-old native Californian knew nothing about when he arrived in Korea to teach English four years ago. Here, Maylone discusses South Korea’s burgeoning underground music scene. Indie bands have long played Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing. Why has it taken so long for South Korea to become a tour stop? That’s basically what I asked myself when I first started doing this. There’s a lot of money here. People spend it on iPhones and entertainment and gadgets. Getting bands here shouldn’t be so hard. I mean, we’re right next to Tokyo, which has what seems like 60,000 shows every night. I don’t know the cause of the oversight, but all of my work is aimed at trying to correct it. How is the economics of booking bands changing there? Now that we’re finding the underground community, we can rely on the fact that we can bring in enough fans to cover costs. One limitation for all of Asia has been gear. Some bigger bands need their own gear, and they have to put it on a ship, which can be really expensive. We now have local gear rental and are trying to make all this local source stuff work in order to fix that. That’s one reason we are working on a tour network. Doing shows in some small Korean cities helps generate money to pay off the flights to get into Korea. I also work with D.I.Y. promoters in Hong Kong and the Philippines to make these larger Asian tours more financially feasible for the artists. How receptive are Korean audiences to your shows? We have a lot of expats who come to the shows, but it’s getting more Korean lately. Initially, I think the Korean crowd saw our shows as “foreigner” shows, because these bands have a lot of expat fans. By hosting bands that have a larger Korean fan base, we’ve grabbed more Koreans’ eyes. What do you see happening in Korea’s music world? I think Korea’s coming into what we in America experienced in the 1950s and ’60s, socially and artistically, and that we’re going to see the rise of more anti-heroes. Something like “Rebel Without a Cause” is going to come out here, or their own hippie movement. Maybe K-pop is going to go through stages like the Beatles did, from straight-up bubblegum to more tripped-out, experimental open-mindedness. It’s related to economics. Korea was having problems in the ’90s. People were having trouble just putting food on their plates. They had a militant government. Now people have all this money to spend. You have the rise of an artist class, and creative explosions are going to follow. People in various industries are sort of betting on it. Vice magazine has gotten involved with music here. Nylon now does a Korean version. I’m hoping we’ll start to feel the development of a Korean signature, a Korean approach to things. Does SuperColorSuper work with Korean bands? Yeah, part of what we do is inform local bands about D.I.Y. touring — how to connect with established bands, drive city to city, live cheaply, sleep at people’s houses and build a following. We’ve also sent some Korean bands to China. One of the projects we’re doing now is making these viral art videos to help launch Korean bands so that people outside of Korea can check them out. For Korean underground music to thrive, there has to be circulation: bands going outside of Korea, bands moving between cities in Korea. What are some Korean bands people should check out? A noise-pop duo called (((10))), comprised of a girl and a guy that have a sort of early Animal Collective sound. Wagwak, a catchy, Bright Eyes-type indie folk duo. Vidulgi Ooyoo, a shoe-gaze band reminiscent of My Bloody Valentine or Slowdive whose name translates to “Pigeon Milk.” Bamseom Pirates, a funny grind-core band who play 30-second songs. A chill-wave band called Googolplex. Yamagata Tweakster is a tongue-in-cheek solo artist who dresses in slacks and a tie and sings and dances with his laptop. There’s not a lot of Korean irony, but there are a few bands that have just come out that are using irony pretty well. The band Ninano Nanda combines Korean pansori operatic singing with really ’90s techno-beats and Mortal Kombat soundtrack-type sounds. What are Korean clubs like? There are these generic halls where you can do your music-award show or whatever. They don’t have much of a flavor, no specific design or genre they focus on, which is good because it means many types of people can use them for different events. We use them for bigger acts. Then there are these dirty little rock clubs like the ones back home. There’s one called DGBD that’s built to look like the inside of CBGB. They bill hard rock and punk. Many of them are in one neighborhood, and that neighborhood’s going through a lot of changes. Is that Hongdae, the university district? Yeah, Hongdae. There are a bunch of university neighborhoods, but Hongdae is where all of this stuff is centered. There’s also an area called Gangnam where all the head-banger and electronic bands play, but the clubs there charge like 40 to get in. Gangnam is more the high-money dance scene. Hongdae is the live-music scene. You’ve played in your own noise pop band, Ssighborgggg, for a number of years. Has being in a touring band made you a better promoter? SuperColorSuper puts a lot of thought into everything. We’re known for having great art and great posters. I’m all about making a show as artistic and visual an environment as possible. I very carefully control the lighting, sound and decor. I care about the audience’s experience. When a band’s playing, I’ll sometimes go on the lighting mixer and just rock out and fit lights with the song, basically using the principles an artist would use to shape something. To make it stimulating, we’re hands-on, because in the end, that’s what people come to shows for. You want a good band, but overall, you want an experience. Seoul is a very new city. Is it lacking the dilapidated infrastructure that often gives great underground venues their character? That sort of character develops organically. When you think of San Francisco, you picture those hilly streets and Victorian houses. When you think of Mexico City, you think of layers of villas. When you think of Tokyo, you think of “Blade Runner” and layers of neon. Right now we’re waiting to see what the archetypical aesthetic of Seoul will be, how it will reveal itself to the world.

Attaining the rank of \\"Venerable\\" within the Catholic Church signifies that the person has reached a significant milestone on the path to sainthood. The process of canonization in the Catholic Church is a lengthy and rigorous one, involving multiple stages, and being declared Venerable is a testament to the candidate's exemplary life, virtues, and contributions to the faith. The journey towards sainthood begins with the candidate being at least five years removed from their death. This waiting period ensures that the individual's life and deeds can be objectively assessed. Once the waiting period has elapsed, the local bishop may open an investigation into the candidate's life. They gather information, testimonies, and documentation about the person's virtues, holiness, and reputation. At this stage, the candidate is often referred to as a \\"Servant of God.\\" Once the local investigation has been completed, its findings are submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. If the Vatican believes that there is enough substantiated evidence to move forward, the Pope may declare the person to be \\"Venerable.\\" This title affirms that the candidate lived a life of \\"heroic virtue\\" and that they are a worthy example for others to follow. The Venerable designation is a significant step forward, as it allows for the continuation of the cause toward beatification (the declaration of being “Blessed”) and ultimately canonization (sainthood). Naturally, this is an enormous accomplishment and a source of pride for believers who support the candidate's cause. The recognition as Venerable serves to strengthen and inspire the faithful.

Here is a question about this article: The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food. Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises. Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning. What is the answer to this question: Has breeding changed the original characterictics of the animals ?","completion":"Yes, breeding has significantly changed the original characteristics of the animals, particularly in the context of poultry. The domestication of poultry began several thousand years ago and has evolved considerably since then. The practice of selective breeding has played a pivotal role in altering the characteristics of these birds to meet specific human needs and preferences. Over the centuries, selective breeding has focused on traits such as fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage, and docility. As a result, modern poultry breeds often exhibit substantial differences from their wild ancestors in both appearance and behavior. These changes have been brought about deliberately in order to enhance productivity and better serve human requirements for meat, eggs, and other purposes. For instance, chickens have been bred for higher growth rates, larger body size, and increased meat yield compared to their wild counterparts. Additionally, egg-laying breeds have been selectively bred for higher egg production, larger egg size, and more consistent egg-laying patterns. These changes in physical attributes and productivity have led to an extensive variety of specialized poultry breeds that are kept for meat and egg production, as well as ornamental purposes. Moreover, selective breeding has also led to the development of birds with a more docile temperament, which makes them more suitable for captive rearing and easier to handle and manage. This behavioral adaptation has allowed for the expansion of intensive commercial poultry farming enterprises, which rely on large numbers of birds kept in confined spaces. In conclusion, breeding has indeed changed the original characteristics of the animals, particularly poultry, to align with the diverse needs and preferences of humans.

Death of DUI suspect found hanging in cell ruled a suicide A 28-year-old drunken driving suspect found hanging from his t-shirt in an NYPD holding cell killed himself, the city medical examiner ruled. Even so, neighbors of Serge Duthely said they couldn’t believe he would take his own life. Duthely, who was arrested Sunday afternoon, was found dead in a holding cell at the 69th Precinct stationhouse in Canarsie, Brooklyn. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging, said Julie Bolcer, a spokewoman for the medical examiner’s office. ROBBERY SUSPECT FOUND HANGING IN BRONX HOLDING CELL The NYPD’s force investigation division is probing his death, police sources said. The investigation, which is a matter of procedure after a death in police custody, will try to determine how long he was in custody, and whether officers performed periodic checks on his well being, sources said. “This is killing me ... I don’t believe it, said Petrina Reid, 39, his next-door neighbor, about the prospect Duthely killed himself. Duthely was close with his family, she said. “They're a very lovely family. They do everything together. So if he was depressed, that's a real shocker to me,” Reid said. “They're always happy people. I always hear them laughing and talking to each other.” Wayne Chang, 26, a family friend of Duthely’s fiancee, demanded answers from police. “We need to know, immediately, what happened to him.

Write a title for this article: The documents show that he claimed to still be worth millions of dollars even as he struggled to remain relevant while his al Qaeda network splintered. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released the newly declassified documents Tuesday. They were recovered during the May 2011 raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in which he was killed. In it, bin Laden said that he had 29 million in Sudan that he wished to be used on \\"jihad for the sake of Allah,\\" while also directing a small portion of that figure to various family members. The whereabouts of the money are unknown. And in a separate letter, from 2008, he wrote, \\"If I am to be killed, pray for me a lot and give continuous charities in my name.\\" Bin Laden's media savvy was also on display. In an undated letter where he wrote about the upcoming 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, he sought something of a media blitz to highlight his belief that the attacks were the precursor to the global financial crisis of the late 2000s. He recommended that his lieutenants reach out to CBS, other unnamed American networks and the Islamabad bureau chief of Al Jazeera to pitch some type of anniversary special, recommending Robert Fisk, a journalist who had previously interviewed him, to moderate. RELATED: The Osama bin Laden documents The financial hardships of al Qaeda also come through in the documents, with bin Laden suggesting a scheme that would extort money from other countries, Mauritania among them, in exchange for a promise from al Qaeda not to attack them in the future. Bin Laden did express concern about attacking Iran and Turkey, however, because much of al Qaeda's money traveled through those countries on its way to members of the organization. Interestingly, bin Laden also appears to have considered moving from Abbottabad in January 2011, some five months before his eventual death, but apparently not because he believed he was being tracked. And there were also apparent differences with the current ISIS philosophy of establishing a caliphate as a base of operations. Bin Laden was reluctant to pursue a caliphate because of the difficulty in garnering popular support for it, along with the day-to-day burden of governing. But his concerns were often more mundane, concerning the education of certain relatives and medical treatment of others. In a letter dated less than three months before his death, bin Laden wrote that he preferred a female relative to visit a female doctor to describe an unidentified set of symptoms and said an x-ray or ultrasound should be obtained if the symptoms persisted. In another letter, bin Laden expressed his gratitude that a brother of his was able to visit a dentist -- something the most-hunted man in the world was unable to do. Bin Laden also feared that one of his wives might have been implanted with a small tracking device in her tooth during a visit to a dentist in Iran, telling her, \\"The size of the chip is about the length of a grain of wheat and the width of a fine piece of vermicelli.\\" The letters show Bin Laden to be paranoid regarding spy agencies tracking his movements, advising his subordinates to only travel on overcast days to avoid aerial surveillance and to dispose of suitcases that had been used to move money due to fears that the bags might contain tracking chips. The more than 100 documents put out Tuesday are the second tranche to be released by the intelligence community and follow a rigorous interagency review process to determine which documents are ready for release to the public after being declassified and translated from Arabic. \\"It's important that the documents collected at bin Laden's compound be made available to the public,\\" Brian Hale, director of public affairs for the Director of National Intelligence said in a press release accompanying the documents. \\"This was no easy feat as members of the task force dedicated themselves over a long period of time,\\" he said. RELATED: Secrets of the bin Laden treasure-trove The latest documents also shine a light on bin Laden's concern over a growing divide between al Qaeda and its affiliates and his efforts to present the terror network as a unified organization. In a letter to the people of Libya, bin Laden praised the overthrow of the \\"tyrant\\" Moammar Gadhafi but called for the country to unite under the banner of Islamic law, while warning the United States and other countries to stay out of Libya. And in a different letter addressed to \\"Muslim brothers and sisters,\\" bin Laden wrote of the importance of avoiding indiscriminate Muslim deaths in jihadi operations and urged jihadis to be judicious in their use of human shields during operations. He also wrote directly to the American people, telling them after President Barack Obama assumed office that attacks against the United States would persist as long as America supported Israel. The intelligence community expects to release additional documents from the raid later this year after they have been declassified.","completion":"Declassified Documents Reveal Bin Laden's Desperation to Maintain Wealth and Relevance Amid Growing Al Qaeda Fragmentation"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. After reading the above, is \\"Services to judges' families, services to the poor, services to military\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Name three things these funds support.\\"? Select from: + no + yes","completion":"+ no The funds mentioned in the passage are for supporting pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems, not services to judges' families or services to the military. The correct answer would only include services to the poor. Other options provided are not mentioned in the passage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Pfeiffer was born in Santa Ana, California, the second of four children of Richard Pfeiffer, an air-conditioning contractor, and Donna (nee Taverna), a housewife. She has one elder brother, Rick (born 1955), and two younger sisters, Dedee Pfeiffer (born 1964), a television and film actress, and Lori Pfeiffer (born 1965). Her parents were both originally from North Dakota. Her paternal grandfather was of German ancestry and her paternal grandmother was of English, Welsh, French, Irish, and Dutch descent, while her maternal grandfather was of Swiss-German descent and her maternal grandmother of Swedish ancestry. Pfeiffer chose to begin the process of dissolving her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and move into semi-retirement in order to spend more quality time with her children and family, meaning that she would continue to star in films sporadically into the 2000s and beyond. Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called Original Sin (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later changed her mind as she was looking to work less for a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas. In the Hitchcockian thriller What Lies Beneath (2000), Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford starred as a well-to-do couple who experience a strange haunting that uncovers secrets about their past. While critical response towards the film was mixed, it opened atop at the box office in July 2000, and went on to gross US291 million worldwide. She then accepted the role of Rita Harrison, a highly strung lawyer helping a father with a developmental disability, in the drama I Am Sam (2001), opposite Sean Penn. Despite grossing 97.8 million worldwide, the movie received unfavorable reviews; Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote: \\"Pfeiffer, apparently stymied by the bland cliches that prop up her screechy role, delivers her flattest, phoniest performance ever\\". Meanwhile, SF Gate observed: \\"In one scene, she breaks down in tears as she unburdens herself to him about her miserable life. It's hard not to cringe, watching this emotionally ready actress fling herself headlong into false material\\". Pfeiffer took on the role of a murderous artist named Ingrid Magnussen in the drama White Oleander (2002), alongside Alison Lohman (in her film debut), Renee Zellweger and Robin Wright. The film was an arthouse success and Pfeiffer garnered a substantial amount of critical praise; Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that \\"Ms. Pfeiffer, giving the most complex screen performance of her career, makes her Olympian seductress at once irresistible and diabolical\\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described her as \\"incandescent,\\" bringing \\"power and unshakable will to her role as mother-master manipulator\\" in a \\"riveting, impeccable performance\\". She earned Best Supporting Actress Awards from the San Diego Film Critics Society and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. Pfeiffer lent her voice for the character of goddess of chaos Eris in Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003), an animated film featuring Brad Pitt as the voice of Sinbad the Sailor. She had struggles with finding the character's villainies. Initially the character was \\"too sexual,\\" then she lacked fun. After the third rewrite, Pfeiffer called producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him \\"You know, you really can fire me\\", but he assured her that this was just part of the process. Following the release of the film, she took a four-year hiatus from acting, during which she remained largely out of the public eye to devote time to her husband and children. At the time, she turned down the role of the White Witch in the fantasy film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe (2005), which went to Tilda Swinton. Did she ever come back after her hiatus?","completion":"Yes, Michelle Pfeiffer did come back after her four-year hiatus. In 2007, she made a return to the big screen by appearing in a few notable films. She starred alongside Robert De Niro, Claire Danes, and Charlie Cox in the fantasy film \\"Stardust,\\" where she played the role of an evil witch, Lamia. The movie received positive reviews from critics and was praised for its visuals and performances, including Pfeiffer's. In the same year, she also starred in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical \\"Hairspray\\" as Velma Von Tussle, alongside John Travolta, Christopher Walken, and Queen Latifah. The movie was a commercial and critical success, receiving favorable reviews for its energetic vibe and the actors' performances. Pfeiffer was recognized for her portrayal of the villainous character, showcasing her versatility as an actress. Throughout the 2010s, Pfeiffer continued taking on various roles in films like \\"Chéri\\" (2009), \\"Dark Shadows\\" (2012), \\"The Family\\" (2013), \\"Mother!\\" (2017), and \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" (2017). She also joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe, portraying Janet van Dyne in \\"Ant-Man and the Wasp\\" (2018) and reprising her role in \\"Avengers: Endgame\\" (2019).

But whether potassium intake could prevent stroke or death wasn't clear,\\" said Smoller, professor of the department of population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. Researchers studied 90,137 women, aged from 50 to 79 for an average 11 years. They looked at how much potassium the women consumed, as well as if they had strokes, including ischemic strokes , or died during the study period. Women in the study were stroke-free at the start and their average dietary potassium intake was 2,611 mg/day. Results of this study are based on potassium from food, not supplements. The researchers found: Women who ate the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to suffer stroke in general and 16 percent less likely to suffer an ischemic stroke than women who ate the least. Women who ate the most potassium were 10 percent less likely to die than those who ate the least. Among women who did not have high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a 27 percent lower ischemic stroke risk and 21 perc ent reduced risk for all stroke types, compared to women who ate the least potassium in their daily diets. Among women with high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a lower risk of death, but potassium intake did not lower their stroke risk. \\"Our findings suggest that women need to eat more p otassium-rich foods.

Police have interviewed a doctor jailed for 22 years for abusing 18 children with cancer or grave blood disorders and asked him for advice on how to protect children from paedophiles, it was revealed today. In December paediatrician Myles Bradbury, 41, was found guilty of ‘gross and grotesque’ abuse of patients and having a cache of 16,000 indecent images of children at home. Bradbury exploited his job as a respected child doctor to target boys and would abuse them behind screens, sometimes with their parents in the room. Jailed: Doctor Myles Bradbury (left, outside court; and right, in his police mugshot), who abused 18 sick boys, was sent to prison for 22 years. Police have interviewed him to learn about catching paedophiles. But he is now advising police on child protection after authorities visited him in prison to learn how to avoid cases like his own, The Daily Mirror reported. Cambridgeshire Police said the prison visit was 'an attempt to gain further information from Bradbury that might help prevent it in future', adding that 'some information was given'. The revelation he is assisting police comes amid claims Bradbury has more unidentified victims, and while a NHS probe into his crimes at Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital is being conducted. He was arrested in November 2013 only after the grandmother of a victim complained to the hospital. About 800 more families were told their children could have been at risk during the five years he worked for the hospital. But the shocking total includes patients he saw at two other hospitals – in Colchester and Ipswich – where he held outpatient clinics between 2008 and 2013. Police found more than 16,000 indecent images of children on a disc in Bradbury’s home. In one case he filmed the vile abuse. In the wake of his guilty plea, Addenbrooke’s launched a helpline and began contacting the families of all patients he was thought to have dealt with. Gadget: A spy pen used by Bradbury to film some of his victims as he carried out examinations on them. About 800 families were told their children could have been at risk during the five years Bradbury spent working at Addenbrooke's Hospital (pictured) in Cambridge. Police believe Bradbury targeted the boys – all of whom were ‘really poorly’ and vulnerable – in his private consulting room. Cambridge Crown Court was told that many of Bradbury's victims would be isolated from their parents and asked to remove their clothes before the doctor would grope their genitals. The depth of the examinations were often increased to meet Bradbury's sexual needs, not any medical requirement, the court heard. One said in a statement read to the court: 'I am now anxious to go to the doctor because I don’t know who I should trust. 'I have haemophilia and a pain in my side so I know I should go but I feel disgusted and weird. I didn’t think it would happen to me and I feel angry every time I think about it but also relieved it wasn’t just me but we shouldn’t have to go through it.' Another said he had regular nightmares, felt stressed and lacked confidence. 'I’d like to see Myles Bradbury and ask him why he did what he did to me,' he added. He would tell their parents they should leave the room in case their children got embarrassed, before sexually touching them for his own gratification and telling them it was a ‘legitimate examination’. As he left court after being sentenced, Bradbury said: ‘I’m so sorry’ and refused to answer further questions. Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway said: ‘This man very cleverly and determinedly created an environment where he not only abused young people, but almost groomed colleagues and parents by being helpful – for example, seeing people outside normal consultancy hours. ‘He would see young people who were really poorly in his own consulting room and create opportunities where he was alone with them. ‘What makes this case particularly distressing is he was very plausible so he would say to young people that they needed an intimate examination. I wasn’t a case of “Don’t tell your parents”. He was putting a veneer of respectability on what he was doing and saying it was a legitimate examination.’ Mr Ridgway said there could be many other victims – including some who don’t even realise they were abused. Sentencing: Judge Gareth Hawkesworth (pictured right in this court sketch) described Bradbury (left) as 'manipulative' and said his actions had undermined the public's trust in the 'overstretched health service' What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article include the following: 1.

Ordinary types of optical waveguides include optical fibres and optical waveguides .","completion":"Let's compare the two sentences step by step to understand if they have the same meaning: 1. Defining optical waveguide: - Sentence 1: An optical waveguide is a physical structure that guides electromagnetic waves in the optical spectrum. - Sentence 2: An optical waveguide is a rectangular structure that guides electromagnetic waves in the physical spectrum. There's a difference in the definition here. Sentence 1 defines an optical waveguide as a physical structure guiding waves in the optical spectrum, while Sentence 2 describes the structure as rectangular and guides waves in the physical spectrum, which is not accurate as an optical waveguide deals specifically with the optical spectrum. 2. Describing common/ordinary optical waveguides: - Sentence 1: Common types of optical waveguides include optical fiber and rectangular waveguides. - Sentence 2: Ordinary types of optical waveguides include optical fibres and optical waveguides. In this part, Sentence 1 mentions common types as optical fiber and rectangular waveguides, while Sentence 2 refers to ordinary types as optical fibres and optical waveguides, which is redundant because it's already talking about optical waveguides. Conclusion: The two sentences do not have the same meaning, as there are discrepancies in the definition of optical waveguides and the types mentioned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A nightclub is generally distinguished from regular bars, pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a stage for live music, one or more dance floor areas and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music and where coloured lights illuminate the dance area. Another distinction is that whereas many pubs and sports bars aim at a mass market, nightclubs typically aim at a niche market of music and dancing enthusiasts and clubgoers. The upmarket nature of nightclubs can be seen in the inclusion of VIP areas in some nightclubs, for celebrities and their guests. Nightclubs are much more likely than pubs or sports bars to use bouncers to screen prospective clubgoers for entry. Some nightclub bouncers do not admit people with ripped jeans or other informal clothing as part of a dress code. The busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday night. Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - Nelson Ackerman Eddy (June 29, 1901 March 6, 1967) was an American singer and actor who appeared in 19 musical films during the 1930s and 1940s, as well as in opera and on the concert stage, radio, television, and in nightclubs. A classically trained baritone, he is best remembered for the eight films in which he costarred with soprano Jeanette MacDonald. He was one of the first \\"crossover\\" stars, a superstar appealing both to shrieking bobby soxers as well as opera purists, and in his heyday, he was the highest paid singer in the world. - A baritone is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the bass and the tenor voice types. It is the most common male voice. Originally from the Greek , meaning \\"deep (or heavy) sounding\\", music for this voice is typically written in the range from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (i.e. FF) in choral music, and from the second A below middle C to the A above middle C (A to A) in operatic music, but can be extended at either end.

Bobby soxers were usually teenage girls and young adult women from about 12 to 25. Fashionable adolescent girls wore poodle skirts and rolled down their socks to the ankle. In high schools and colleges, the gymnasium was often used as a dance floor; however, since street shoes and street detritus might damage the polished wood floors, the students were required to remove their shoes and flop dance in their bobby socks, hence the phrase \\"sock hop\\". - The Love Parade is a 1929 American Pre-Code musical comedy film about the marital difficulties of Queen Louise of Sylvania (Jeanette MacDonald) and her consort, Count Alfred Renard (Maurice Chevalier). Despite his love for Louise and his promise to be an obedient husband, Count Alfred finds his role as a figurehead unbearable. - Maurice Auguste Chevalier (September 12, 1888 January 1, 1972) was a French actor, cabaret singer and entertainer.

His trademark attire was a boater hat, which he always wore on stage with a tuxedo. - Sharon Rich (born June 11, 1953) is an author and film historian, best known for the biography \\"Sweethearts\\" about 1930s singing stars Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. She was close friends for many years with Jeanette's older sister, actress Blossom Rock (aka Marie Blake). Along with interviewing hundreds of people, Rich had access to many collections of private letters, Eddys personal scrapbooks, diary entries, FBI files and MacDonalds unpublished autobiography. As follow up documentation to \\"Sweethearts\\", Rich has written several additional books and edited and written over seventy magazine articles. In 1995 she was awarded a Dame of Merit by the Knights of Malta for her contribution to History and Literature. - Sweethearts : The Timeless Love Affair On screen and Off Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy is biographical book by Sharon Rich .

It stars Maurice Chevalier as a tailor who poses as a nobleman and Jeanette MacDonald as a princess with whom he falls in love. It also stars Charles Ruggles as a penniless nobleman, along with Charles Butterworth and Myrna Loy as members of his family. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Jeanette Anna MacDonald (June 18, 1903 January 14, 1965) was an American singer and actress best remembered for her musical films of the 1930s with Maurice Chevalier (\\"The Love Parade\\", \\"Love Me Tonight\\", \\"The Merry Widow\\" and \\"One Hour With You\\") and Nelson Eddy \\"Naughty Marietta\\", \\"Rose-Marie\\", and \\"Maytime\\").

These groups may be assigned specific tasks or projects throughout the semester, allowing students to work together and learn from one another. 4. Concepts Review: The tutor may review important concepts or topics covered in the lectures to ensure that everyone understands the material and is on the same page. This can involve answering questions, clarifying any misconceptions, or elaborating on certain ideas. 5. Interactive Learning: The tutor may facilitate interactive learning activities such as group discussions, debates, problem-solving exercises, or case studies. These activities are designed to encourage engagement, critical thinking, and application of knowledge to real-world scenarios. 6. Skill Development: The tutor may introduce or reinforce specific skills relevant to the course material. For example, a writing class may focus on improving grammar and punctuation, while a math class might work on problem-solving techniques. 7. Assessment Preparation: The tutorial sessions may involve practice exercises, quizzes, or mock exams to help students prepare for upcoming assessments. The tutor can provide feedback on performance, helping students identify areas they need to improve on and working with them to develop effective study strategies. 8. Troubleshooting and Support: The tutor serves as a resource for students who are facing difficulties with the course material or any other academic challenges. They can provide additional support, explanations, and resources to help students overcome their struggles and succeed in the course. 9. Reflection and Evaluation: Towards the end of the tutorial session, the tutor might encourage students to reflect on what they have learned, identify areas that need improvement, and set goals for future sessions. This can help students become more purposeful and proactive in their learning. 10. Wrap Up: Finally, the tutor will likely summarize the key takeaways from the session, clarify any outstanding questions, and remind students of any upcoming deadlines or assignments. They may also provide details on how to contact them if students have any questions or require additional support outside of the tutorial sessions. In summary, after getting a new room for your tutorial, you can expect an organized and structured learning environment that promotes engagement, collaboration, and skill development.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. and the situation: The specialists studied two groups of larvae.

Below is a more detailed and extensive answer: \\"In the context of trust resources, the timeline for spending the funds significantly depends on the specific terms laid down by the grantor or the trust document itself. When discussing Warren Buffett's case, the statement does highlight that the proceeds from his Berkshire Hathaway shares are intended to be used for philanthropic purposes within 10 years after his estate has been settled. This is a predetermined timeline established by Buffett, and it serves as a guide for the trustees, who must ensure that the allocated resources are indeed spent within the stipulated timeframe. However, there can be variance in the spending timelines depending on different trusts and their stipulations or conditions. For example: 1. Spendthrift Trusts: Designed to protect beneficiaries from their own potential financial mismanagement, spendthrift trusts typically require that assets be distributed to beneficiaries over time, often through regular payments or upon the attainment of specific milestones (e.g., reaching a certain age, completing education, etc.). 2. Charitable Trusts: These types of trusts provide benefits to one or more charitable organizations, with the assets typically being disbursed over an extended timeframe or sometimes in perpetuity. In some cases, specific terms may dictate the timing of distributions to the charity or charitable causes, while in other cases, the philanthropic goals of the trust may be met through annual contributions or one-time lump-sum distributions. 3. Discretionary Trusts: In these trusts, the trustee exercises decision-making power over the distribution of assets to the beneficiaries. In this case, the timing for spending the trust resources can vary significantly, depending on the trustee's discretion and the beneficiary's circumstances. 4. Testamentary Trusts: These trusts, established by a deceased person's will, often have specific requirements for the distribution of assets, such as spending the resources within a certain number of years after the testator's death or upon the beneficiary reaching a certain age. The exact timing depends on the wording of the will and the goals of the testator. In conclusion, while the quote provided does give an accurate answer for Buffett's specific case, the spending timeline for trust resources can vary based on the unique circumstances and goals of different trust types and grantor intentions. The correct answer for when the trust resources must be spent depends on the specific trust document or stipulations set by the creator of the trust.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"uh-huh yeah i like him\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"He's one of my favorites.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"uh-huh yeah i like him,\\" it is not definitively possible to determine whether the hypothesis \\"He's one of my favorites\\" is true or not. While the statement \\"I like him\\" does indicate a positive regard for the person in question, it does not necessarily convey the strength or depth of that regard. To assess whether the hypothesis \\"He's one of my favorites\\" is true, we need to delve into various aspects of the premise and consider possible circumstances. 1. The phrase \\"uh-huh yeah\\" may be interpreted as agreement, but does not necessarily imply enthusiasm or strong emotion. It could be indicative of differing levels of enthusiasm, from mild interest to a stronger emotional attachment, depending on the context and tone of the conversation. 2. The term \\"favorite\\" has a stronger meaning than just \\"liking\\" someone. If someone is considered a favorite, it indicates that the person occupies a special position among a group of individuals. Although the premise suggests that the speaker likes the person in question, it doesn't strongly convey that the person is one of their favorites; it may simply mean that the person is perceived positively or is liked. 3. The context of the conversation should be taken into account to assess the hypothesis. For instance, if the discussion revolves around comparing multiple people or listing some of their most admired individuals, then the premise may imply that the person is one of the speaker's favorites. On the other hand, if the conversation is more casual, and the speaker is just sharing their thoughts, the premise may not necessarily indicate that the person is one of their favorites. 4. The speaker's personality, communication style, and prior statements could also influence the interpretation of the premise. If the speaker tends to downplay their emotions or uses subtle expressions to describe their feelings, then the premise may be an understated way of conveying that the person in question is one of their favorites. Conversely, if the speaker is known to be more expressive and effusive, the statement may simply mean that they like the person, but not to the level of being one of their favorites. 5. The connection between the speaker and the person in question must also be contemplated. If the speaker has a personal relationship with the individual, then they might consider him as one of their favorites. However, if their relationship lacks depth or is merely based on a single encounter, then the hypothesis remains inconclusive. In conclusion, based on the premise \\"uh-huh yeah i like him,\\" and without additional context or information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the hypothesis \\"He's one of my favorites\\" is true or not. While there is evidence of a positive regard for the person in question, there is not enough information to ascertain if this extends to the level of being considered one of the speaker's favorites."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: George Gershwin, born in 1998, was one of America's greatest composers. He published his first song when he was eighteen years old. During the next twenty years he wrote more than five hundred songs. Many of Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theatres in New York City. These plays were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s. Many of his songs have remained popular as ever. Over the years they have been sung and played in every possible way -- from jazz to country. In the 1920s there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music? In 1924 jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized he had just a few weeks to do it. And in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra which he called Rhapsody in Blue. Gershwin himself played the piano at the concert. The audience were thrilled when they heard his music. It made him world-famous and showed that jazz music could be both serious and popular. In 1928, Gershwin went to Paris. He applied to study composition with the well-known musician Nadia Boulanger, but she rejected him. She was afraid that classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style. While there, Gershwin wrote An American in Paris. When it was first performed, critics were divided over the music. Some called it happy and full of life, to others it was silly and boring. But it quickly became popular in Europe and the United States. It still remains one of his most famous works. George Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He was only thirty-nine years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. People mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have still written.

Article:","completion":"Title: How to Create a Faux Hickey with Eye Shadow: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction A hickey, also known as a love bite or a kiss mark, is essentially a bruise that occurs as a result of kissing, sucking, or biting the skin. While some may wear hickeys with pride, others prefer to leave their private lives more discreet. For those who fall into the latter category, creating a faux hickey can be a fun and harmless way to experiment with this sort of temporary body modification. In this article, we'll show you how to create a convincing fake hickey using a large eye shadow palette. Step 1: Choose the Location for the Hickey Before you get started with applying makeup, you'll need to choose the perfect spot for your hickey. Real hickeys can occur anywhere on the body, but are most commonly found on the neck, shoulders, or collarbone area. These locations are ideal for a fake hickey, too, as they're often exposed and easy to reach with your makeup brush. Step 2: Obtain a Large Eye Shadow Palette To achieve a realistic faux hickey, it's essential to have a wide range of colors to work with. A large eye shadow palette with multiple shades of pink, purple, and blue is ideal. These colors will allow you to create depth and dimension, making your fake hickey appear more convincing. Look for a palette that includes both matte and shimmer shades, as the combination of textures will enhance the hickey's appearance. Step 3: Apply the Pink Eye Shadow Once you've chosen your makeup palette and located the perfect spot for your hickey, it's time to begin applying your eye shadow. Start with a light pink shade, as this will form the base of the hickey. It's important to begin with a lighter color, as this will make it easier to blend the other shades together for a seamless look. Use a small, precise makeup brush to apply the pink eye shadow over the area you've chosen for the hickey, making sure to blend the edges for a smooth transition into your natural skin tone. Step 4: Add the Purple Eye Shadow Next, you'll want to add some depth and dimension to your faux hickey. To do this, use a slightly darker purple eye shadow from your palette. Applying the purple shade over the pink will create the appearance of bruising, making your fake hickey look more authentic. Focus on the center of the pink area, but be sure to blend the edges for a seamless transition between the two colors. Step 5: Add the Blue Eye Shadow After the pink and purple eye shadows have been applied, use a small amount of blue eye shadow to enhance the hickey's three-dimensional appearance. Blue will add a cool undertone to the mix, making the fake bruise appear more realistic. Use the blue eye shadow sparingly, though, as you don't want the color to be too overpowering. Simply dab a little blue on top of the purple eye shadow and blend gently to create the desired effect. Step 6: Set the Makeup Once you've achieved your desired hickey appearance, it's important to set your makeup so that it stays in place and doesn't smudge or fade throughout the day. To do this, simply apply a translucent setting powder or setting spray over the entire hickey. This will lock in the eye shadow and ensure that your faux hickey remains intact for as long as you want it to last. Conclusion Creating a fake hickey with eye shadow is a fun and easy way to experiment with body art, allowing you to enjoy the temporary thrill of sporting a love bite without any unwanted attention or permanent damage to your skin. Just follow these simple steps, and before long, you'll have a realistic-looking faux hickey that's sure to turn heads!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This is primarily attributable to the fact that they possess a high energy content and can create considerable heat as they burn. Moreover, with their rapid growth and ability to thrive in various climates, they are a popular choice for firewood. However, stating that they are used to produce \\"sweets\\" is inaccurate, as birch trees are not typically employed for the production of confectionery items.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: I am facing a new situation today: Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question: What would cause someone to have to re illustrate point? Here are possible answers to this question: - teacher - did not understand - agree with - understanding - understood I believe the correct choice is \\"did not understand\\", here's why: A:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"did not understand,\\" and I'll provide an explanation as to why this is the case. When someone needs to re-illustrate a point, it usually means that they have to explain or clarify a concept or idea again. This can happen when the initial explanation or illustration was not clear, comprehensive, or effective enough for the listener to fully grasp the information being presented. In this case, the need to re-illustrate a point stems from a lack of understanding on the part of the person receiving the information. Now, let's examine each possible answer to understand why \\"did not understand\\" is the correct choice: 1. Teacher: While a teacher may be the person who needs to re-illustrate a point, the presence of a teacher doesn't directly cause the need for re-illustration. A teacher's role is to facilitate understanding, but they are not the reason for re-illustrating a point. 2. Did not understand: As mentioned above, this is the correct answer. The need to re-illustrate a point is driven by the fact that the person receiving the information did not understand the initial explanation or illustration. 3. Agree with: Agreeing with a point does not necessitate re-illustration. If someone agrees with a point, it means they have understood it and there would be no need to clarify or explain it again. 4. Understanding: Understanding a point also does not require re-illustration. If a person has a solid grasp of the concept or idea being presented, there would be no need to re-illustrate the point. 5. Understood: Similar to the previous two options, having understood a point negates the need for re-illustration. Re-illustrating a point is only necessary when there is a lack of understanding. In summary, the correct choice for what would cause someone to have to re-illustrate a point is \\"did not understand,\\" as this highlights the need for clarification or further explanation to ensure the listener fully comprehends the information being shared."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a summary based on this article: One moment Sheila Keen Warren was on a trip to see her mom in Vermont. The next, she was handcuffed and placed in the back of a Virginia sheriff’s cruiser. “Where are we going?” “Am I under arrest and what for?” “Is my husband under arrest?” the 54-year-old blond-haired woman in the bright aqua tank top, capri jeans and flip-flops asked. Back at the sheriff’s headquarters, she sat in an interview room making small talk about her nickname “Debbie” and where she lived. But then the conversation turned serious when she was told she’s the accused shooter in South Florida’s killer clown case from 27 years earlier. Authorities had come to hold her accountable for the May 26, 1990, slaying of Marlene Warren, 40, in Wellington. Keen Warren placed her head down on a desk and declined to say another word. This glimpse of Keen Warren’s Sept. 26 capture, and the renewed investigation that led to it after all these years, is detailed in files released Thursday by the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office, in response to public records requests. The records explain how recent testing of DNA evidence was the key to cracking a high-profile case that had long gone cold but is now the center of a death penalty prosecution. Sheila Keen Warren is facing charges in the death of Marlene Warren in 1990. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the 54-year-old woman accused of wearing a clown disguise during the May 26, 1990, slaying of Marlene Warren, 40, in Wellington. Keen Warren’s husband, Michael Warren, was married to the murder victim and was labeled an original person of interest by police. Authorities won’t say if he is still a suspect. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters after Keen Warren’s arrest it “remains to be seen” whether anyone else will be charged in the case. Michael Warren, who has long denied any role, was en route to Calder Race Track with friends at the time his wife was shot at their home in the Aero Club community. The 2,847 pages of documents released Thursday include new allegations along with all of the original investigative reports that made the case so remarkable: Marlene Warren opened the door to greet a clown wearing an orange wig, a red bulb nose, gloves and a smile painted on its white face. The clown held two balloons and flowers in one hand and a pistol in the other. The clown fired at Warren’s face. She died within two days. The clown fled in a white Chrysler LeBaron, which was found four days later abandoned at a shopping center parking lot. Here are some of the revelations from the evidence also recently shared with Keen Warren’s lawyer: — Detectives collected samples of Sheila Keen’s hair and vials of her blood through a June 1990 search warrant, because she was then a suspect. There was also a court-ordered search of her apartment that yielded fibers from a bright orange wig and clothing that police were checking for blood stains. And similar fibers were found in the getaway car. — In the reopened investigation, those samples were sent to an FBI crime lab and some matches were made to fibers collected from the Chrysler, though a precise DNA connection is not included. “Sheila Keen can be included as a possible source of these hairs,” according to a 2016 investigator’s report. But the FBI lab’s report was not released to reporters. — Michael Warren was listed as the beneficiary of a life insurance police issued for his wife Marlene Warren in March 1979. In May 2017, Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance confirmed that “the death claim was paid in June 1991 in the amount of 53,359.37 to Michael Warren.” — An attorney, Christopher DeSantis, gave investigators a statement in 1991 concerning his conversation two years earlier with Michael Warren as they left a courthouse. Warren “asked me what the ramifications would be if a husband killed his wife on her estate,” DeSantis said then. The lawyer advised that if the husband had a friend who did it and they couldn’t tie the husband to the friend, he’d get away Scott free. — In October 2017, DeSantis gave another statement to investigators. This time, he said he “he told Mike Warren … that if someone wore a clown suit they would get off because no one would be able to identify the features such as male/female or identity of the person committing the crime.” — One day after Keen Warren’s arrest, Palm Beach County detectives met with an employee of the Kingsport, Tenn., restaurant formerly owned by Michael and Sheila Keen Warren. The employee, Julia Thomas, said her former roommate and co-worker, Danielle Sweeting, told her of a time that “Debbie” got drunk and confessed to her. “Debbie said that she had picked out the clown outfit and killed his wife,” Thomas recalled. — Marlene’s son Joseph Ahrens and another person, Jean Pratt, got into a car and chased the clown moments after the shooting. Detectives wrote that Jean Pratt told investigators in a June 27, 1991, statement that “the clown suspect was definitely a man. … It wasn’t a woman.” — Michael Warren’s friends told police that he “did not act very upset” after his wife’s death. Witnesses told the cops that a few months before the murder they observed fights between Marlene and Michael Warren, as well as Marlene confronting Sheila Keen about having an affair with Michael. — Marlene Warren’s funeral was videotaped, but detectives who reviewed it saw nothing useful to the investigation. For the past 15 years, the Warrens lived in small, historic Abingdon, Va., within the Blue Ridge Mountains. They had a reputation as a hardworking, sociable couple who until last year operated a popular fast-food restaurant in nearby Kingsport, Tenn. Keen, then 27, had been working for Michael Warren’s used car dealership, Bargain Motors Inc. of West Palm Beach, helping to repossess cars. During the original murder investigation, detectives discovered Warren was rolling back odometers on vehicles at his used car lot. He was convicted of racketeering and multiple other felonies and served nearly four years in a minimum-security state prison at the Homestead Correctional Institution. He was released on New Year's Eve 1997. ||||| WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Two nights before a clown fatally shot a woman at her front door, a customer showed up at a nearby costume shop and begged to be let in at closing. On this night 28 years ago, the woman urgently told two clerks she needed a clown suit, an orange wig, white gloves, a red nose and enough white makeup to cover her face completely. She passed on the floppy shoes. One of the clerks in a photo lineup identified the customer as Sheila Keen, who was rumored in May 1990 to be having an affair with victim Marlene Warren's husband. The other clerk thought it might be Keen, but wasn't 100 percent. Palm Beach County prosecutors released late Thursday evidence that they say helped them and sheriff's detectives to arrest Keen in September at the Abington, Virginia, home she shared with her husband — Michael Warren, Marlene Warren's widower. The evidence includes hundreds of pages of witness statements, photographs, reports and maps. It also says recent DNA tests conducted by the FBI say hair found in a car linked to the slaying could have come from Sheila Keen Warren. Prosecutors released the evidence without comment. Her attorney, Richard Lubin, did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment. Michael Warren, reached by phone, declined comment. Detectives have declined to rule him out as a possible suspect. Keen Warren, now 54, remains jailed without bond. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. According to the documents, she became a suspect shortly after the slaying. Marlene Warren, 40, opened her door on a Saturday morning to find a clown in an orange wig, a red nose but normal high-top shoes holding two foil balloons and carnations. Her then 20-year-old son and his friends, who were in the house, say the clown handed her the gifts. The clown without saying a word then shot her in the face, walked slowly to a Chrysler LeBaron convertible and drove away. Michael Warren at the time owned a used car lot and Sheila Keen did repossessions for him. Other employees, according to the document, told detectives Warren and Keen had been seen kissing and having sex in the office and her neighbors said he was frequently at her house. Warren and Keen denied a relationship. They married in 2002. The documents show that immediately after the shooting, detectives worked to find where the clown costume, the balloons and flowers had been purchased and to find the car. Along with the costume shop employees, the detectives learned the flowers and balloons came from a supermarket a half mile from the victim's home, bought by a woman who looked like Keen who wore white gloves. The LeBaron was soon found abandoned in a parking lot. It had been reported stolen by a Payless rental agency near Michael Warren's car lot, Bargain Motors. The couple who rented it last told detectives they had arrived afterhours at the Payless, hoping to leave the car. Finding no employees, they went home, looked in the Yellow Pages and called what they thought was Payless. A man told them to leave the car with its keys in the visor in front of the lot and someone would get it. They reluctantly did. When they went back later, the car was gone, so they called the number again and the same man acted like he never spoke to them. The next morning they realized they had called Bargain Motors — its Yellow Page ad read \\"Payless!\\" The rental agency had previously sued Michael Warren over the ad and an employee told detectives Michael Warren and another employee had pulled the ruse to steal the car as payback. No one was ever charged with the theft. Warren told detectives he and his wife had a good relationship, but his employees and her family said Marlene Warren had been threatening to divorce him over numerous affairs and a beating she said he had administered a year before. Warren's employees told detectives he had said he would never divorce because his wife would get half his assets. Keen was interviewed by detectives shortly after the shooting and blood and hair were collected. She denied being the shooter, saying she was in another part of the county looking for cars that needed to be repossessed. Michael Warren was convicted in 1994 of grand theft, racketeering and odometer tampering and served almost four years in prison. After his wedding to Keen, they settled in Virginia just across from Kingsport, Tennessee, where they operated a popular restaurant that they sold just before her arrest. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Sheila Keen Warren, formerly known as Debbie, is a 54-year-old woman who has been charged in the so-called \\"killer clown case\\", the murder of Marlene Warren (40) in Wellington, Florida on May 26, 1990.

This article: The seabed contains enormous reserves of minerals which can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialised shipyards and infrastructure costs are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up and the washing away of spoil heaps. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage. Seafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc and trace metals since their discovery in the 1960s. They form when geothermally heated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as \\"black smokers\\". The ores are of high quality but prohibitively costly to extract. Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of Papua New Guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.There are large deposits of petroleum, as oil and natural gas, in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage, and oil may be spilt.Large quantities of methane clathrate exist on the seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around 2 °C (36 °F) and these are of interest as a potential energy source. Some estimates put the amount available at between one and 5 million cubic kilometres (0.24 to 1.2 million cubic miles). Also on the seabed are manganese nodules formed of layers of iron, manganese and other hydroxides around a core. In the Pacific these may cover up to 30 percent of the deep ocean floor.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: Ethiopian historians such as Taddesse Tamrat (1935–2013) and Sergew Hable Sellassie have argued that modern Ethiopian studies were an invention of the 17th century and originated in Europe. Tamrat considered Carlo Conti Rossini's 1928 Storia d'Etiopia a groundbreaking work in Ethiopian studies. The philosopher Messay Kebede likewise acknowledged the genuine contributions of Western scholars to the understanding of Ethiopia's past. But he also criticized the perceived scientific and institutional bias that he found to be pervasive in Ethiopian-, African-, and Western-made historiographies on Ethiopia. Specifically, Kebede took umbrage at E. A. Wallis Budge's translation of the Kebra Nagast, arguing that Budge had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba although the Kebra Nagast itself did not indicate such a provenience for this fabled ruler. According to Kebede, a South Arabian extraction was contradicted by biblical exegetes and testimonies from ancient historians, which instead indicated that the Queen was of African origin. Additionally, he chided Budge and Ullendorff for their postulation that the Aksumite civilization was founded by Semitic immigrants from South Arabia. Kebede argued that there is little physical difference between the Semitic-speaking populations in Ethiopia and neighboring Cushitic-speaking groups to validate the notion that the former groups were essentially descendants of South Arabian settlers, with a separate ancestral origin from other local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. He also observed that these Afroasiatic-speaking populations were heterogeneous, having interbred with each other and also assimilated alien elements of both uncertain extraction and negroid origin. answer the following question: What was the full name of the person Messay Kebede argued had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba?

Navigating between settings is really frustrating, and figuring out what each option does is quite difficult. In comparison to other camera apps I've tried, this one is just not user-friendly at all. The app is also not working properly on my phone. Every time I try switching to video mode, the app crashes. I've tried it on multiple devices, but the problem remains unresolved. The developers seem unresponsive to user feedback, and there doesn't seem to be any improvement in newer updates. Overall, I'm very disappointed in Open Camera.

Question: What celebration are they at? Movie title: Uncle Sam Movie plot: In Kuwait, a military unit uncovers an American helicopter downed by friendly fire at least three years ago. As the wreckage is inspected, Master Sergeant Sam Harper, one of the burnt bodies within, springs to life and kills a sergeant and a major, and returns to an inert state after muttering, \\"Don't be afraid, it's only friendly fire!\\" Weeks later, Sam's body is delivered to his hometown of Twin Rivers, which is preparing for Independence Day. Sam's wife Louise is given custody of the casket containing Sam's remains, which are left in the home of Sam's estranged sister Sally, who lives with her patriotic young son, Jody. Sam reanimates in the early hours of the Fourth of July, and proceeds to kill and steal the costume of a perverted Uncle Sam. Sam then makes his way to a cemetery, where he murders two of three juvenile delinquents who had vandalized tombstones, and desecrated an American flag. During the Independence Day celebration (which a corrupt congressman is visiting) Sam beheads the third delinquent, kills Jody's teacher (who had opposed the Vietnam War) with a hatchet, and shoots Sally's unscrupulous lawyer boyfriend in the head. Despite these deaths, the festivities continue, but are thrown into disarray when Sam uses the fireworks gear to blow up the congressman, and a flagpole to impale Louise's deputy boyfriend.

Commas are often used to set off introductory elements in a sentence, making the structure of the sentence clearer for the reader. 2. Another comma is used before \\"before accepting a temporary post at the University of Notre Dame in 1952.\\" This provides a pause in the sentence, clearly separating his traveling habit and his eventual acceptance of a temporary post.

Here is a hypothesis: Under the second tier consisted of the small entities. Here are the options: Choices: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"C). no. The hypothesis cannot be directly validated based on the premise. Even though both the premise and the hypothesis mention \\"small entities\\" and \\"second/tier II\\", there is no direct evidence in the premise that supports the claim of the hypothesis. The premise speaks about the supposed impact (a large decrease in reimbursement rates for meals served) on a specific group of small entities - tier II day care home providers. The premise does not however imply any form of composition or hierarchical structure of these small entities, much less a 'second tier', as stated in the hypothesis. The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a claim about the composition/structure of 'small entities', placing them under the 'second tier'. But no such organization is mentioned or implied in the premise. Therefore, there's no substantiated connection between the scenario provided in the premise and the categorical claim made in the hypothesis to conclude if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. It's also worth pointing out that the terms \\"the small entities\\" and \\"second tier\\" might have different meanings or refer to different contexts in the premise and the hypothesis. The premise specifically discloses that \\"the small entities\\" refers to \\"tier II day care home providers\\", whereas the hypothesis might be talking about \\"the small entities\\" in a different context that we are not told. Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring countries France and Spain were competing for economical supremacy in Europe. Spain dug up fossil fuels and used it as an energy source.

Wall Street is an eight-block-long street running roughly northwest to southeast from Broadway to South Street, at the East River, in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City. Over time, the term has become a metonym for the financial markets of the United States as a whole, the American financial services industry (even if financial firms are not physically located there), or New York-based financial interests. Anchored by Wall Street, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Several other major exchanges have or had headquarters in the Wall Street area, including the New York Mercantile Exchange, the New York Board of Trade, and the former American Stock Exchange. There are varying accounts about how the Dutch-named \\"de Waalstraat\\" got its name. A generally accepted version is that the name of the street was derived from a wall (actually a wooden palisade) on the northern boundary of the New Amsterdam settlement, built to protect against Native Americans, pirates, and the British. A conflicting explanation is that Wall Street was named after \\"Walloons\\"— the Dutch name for a \\"Walloon\\" is \\"Waal\\". Among the first settlers that embarked on the ship \\"Nieu Nederlandt\\" in 1624 were 30 Walloon families. While the Dutch word \\"wal\\" can be translated as \\"rampart\\", it only appeared on maps as \\"de Walstraat\\" on English maps of New Amsterdam.

News article: Tom Cruise is the clear winner at North American multiplexes this weekend with “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” heading for a solid 35 million second weekend, estimates showed Saturday. Paramount’s second weekend of “Fallout” easily topped the launch of Disney’s live-action “Christopher Robin,” which debuted with a respectable 27 million at 3,602 screens at the low end of forecasts. Lionsgate’s action-comedy “The Spy Who Dumped Me” will finish third with about 12.4 million at 3,111 locations, matching expectations. Fox’s opening of dystopian sci-fier “The Darkest Minds” debuted quietly with about 6 million at 3,127 locations behind a quartet of holdovers — Universal’s third weekend of “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again” with 9 million, Sony’s third weekend of “The Equalizer 2” with 8.3 million, Sony’s fourth weekend of “Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation,” with 8.1 million and Disney’s fifth weekend of “Ant-Man and the Wasp” with 6.3 million. Dinesh D’Souza’s pro-Donald Trump documentary “Death of a Nation: Can We Save America a Second Time?” is launching in 13th place with 2.7 million at 1,032 locations this weekend for Quality Flix. Related 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' Director Details Filming of Tom Cruise's Big Stunts Tom Cruise's 'Top Gun: Maverick' Pushed Back to 2020, 'A Quiet Place' Sequel Dated “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” the sixth film in the Paramount franchise, is screening at 4,395 sites and declining only 43% from its opening weekend of 61.2 million. The action-thriller is also performing better than 2015’s “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation,” which won its second weekend over “Fantastic Four” with 28 million. “Fallout” should wind up the weekend with 124 million in its first 10 days. “Fallout” won Friday with 9.8 million, 300,000 better than “Christopher Robin,” which opened amid a campaign aimed at nostalgia-loving adults and their children. Based on the characters from A.A. Milne’s Winnie the Pooh books, the story centers on Ewan McGregor’s sad middle-aged version of Christopher Robin being emotionally rescued by his childhood friends Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, and Eeyore. Marc Forster, returning to the same territory as “Finding Neverland,” directed “Christopher Robin.” Audiences gave “Christopher Robin” an A CinemaScore while critics were mostly positive with a 67% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Lionsgate-Imagine’s “The Spy Who Dumped Me” stars Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon as best friends pursued through Europe by assassins. The raucous R-rated comedy earned a B CinemaScore. Susanna Fogel directed and co-wrote with David Iserson, while Justin Theroux, Gillian Anderson, Hasan Minhaj, and Sam Heughan round out the cast. “Spy” carries a 39% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. “The Darkest Minds,” which carries a 34 million price tag, performed at the low end of modest expectations. The film is based on Alexandra Bracken’s novel and set in a dystopian America where a group of teenagers is on the run from the government after mysteriously obtaining superpowers. The film stars Amandla Stenberg, Mandy Moore, and Gwendoline Christie. Reviewers have been underwhelmed with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 19%. With the top two films combining for about 60 million, overall domestic moviegoing should be up significantly over the same 2017 weekend, which was led by “The Dark Tower” with 19 million in its debut — marking the start of one of the slowest Augusts in more than a decade. Summer domestic box office is up a hefty 10.4% to 3.46 billion as of Aug. 1, according to comScore, and year-to-date domestic box office is also leading last year by 7.6% at 7.4 billion. ||||| R-rated comedy 'The Spy Who Dumped Me' and pro-Trump documentary 'Death of a Nation' are also opening nationwide; 'Black Panther' leaps past 700 million in North America nearly six months after hitting theaters. In the showdown between Tom Cruise and Winnie the Pooh at the box office, Cruise is winning. Paramount's Mission: Impossible — Fallout is pacing to gross 35 million or more in its second weekend for a decline of just 43 percent. Disney's new family offering, Christopher Robin — inspired by the classic children's tale Winnie the Pooh — is projected to earn 25 million-27 million in its domestic debut. Christopher Robin earned 9.5 million on Friday, including 1.5 million in Thursday previews, compared to 9.9 million for M:I6. Prerelease tracking had showed Disney's live-action/CGI hybrid opening to 28 million or more, with many services predicting 30 million-plus. And in other Disney news, the studio announced Saturday that Black Panther is crossing the 700 million mark in North America, becoming only the third film to achieve the milestone behind fellow Disney pic Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Fox's Avatar, not adjusted for inflation. Christopher Robbin, directed by Marc Forster, stars Ewan McGregor as an overworked and stressed-out adult Christopher Robin, who has lost touch with his imagination. All that changes when his childhood friends — Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Tigger and the rest of the gang — magically emerge from the Hundred Acre Wood. Christopher Robin earned an A CinemaScore. Several other films are also set to open nationwide, including Lionsgate and Imagine Entertainment's The Spy Who Dumped Me. Directed by Susanna Fogel, the R-rated action-comedy starring Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon earned 5 million on Friday for a third-place opening in the 12 million-13 million range. (The comedy genre continues to be challenging at the box office.) The story follows two friends who become entangled in an international conspiracy when one of the women discovers that her ex-boyfriend is a spy. Justin Theroux, Gillian Anderson, Hasan Minhaj, Ivanna Sakhno and Sam Heughan co-star. For the first time since Deadpool 2 in mid-May, Fox enters the box-office fray with the YA film adaptation The Darkest Minds, directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson, the acclaimed helmer of the last two Kung Fu Panda movies. The film grossed 2.3 million on Friday for a projected 6 million opening. Both Spy Who Dumped Me and Darkest Minds earned a mediocre B CinemaScore. Darkest Minds follows a group of teens who mysteriously develop new abilities and are detained and declared a threat by the government. Sixteen-year-old Ruby (Amandla Stenberg) escapes and joins a growing resistance with other teens. Mandy Moore, Bradley Whitford, Harris Dickinson, Patrick Gibson, Skylan Brooks, Miya Cech and Gwendoline Christie also star. The fourth pic opening nationwide is the pro-Trump documentary Death of a Nation, from controversial conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, who was pardoned earlier this year by President Donald Trump after pleading guilty to violating campaign finance laws. The doc, playing in 1,005 theaters, far fewer locations than its competitors, is eyeing an opening in the 2.5 million-3 million range. D'Souza's last doc, Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party, grossed 4 million when expanding into a total of 1,217 theaters in its second weekend after first debuting in three theaters. Death of a Nation looks to earn 2 million-4 million (the doc presently has a 0 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes). Aug. 3, 12:45 p.m. Updated with revised weekend estimates.

Mobile is playing a bigger role in the world, and as it does, it’s enabling some profound shifts in how we live. Soon, our mobile devices – from smartphones to wearables – will know so much about us that they will transform into personal mobile concierges and be able to seamlessly transact on our behalf without prompting. We’re already moving toward this hyper-connected world – toward the Internet of Things – where machine-to-machine communications will soon outpace human-to-machine conversations. But for this connected world to work as seamlessly as many envision, it requires much more than just technology that can predict our wants and needs. For one, it requires an open and secure, developer-friendly platform — one that is linked together through a cross-platform mobile payments OS. Startups need to be able to quickly move through hundreds of failures before ultimately finding the product or service that resonates with consumers. Today’s most successful startups at one point had to iterate and pivot based on critical feedback from the market. Before Instagram and Flickr became the successful businesses they are today, for example, they both started out with completely different business models but evolved their businesses in response to market feedback. Security is also paramount. There’s both a need to reduce friction — like removing passwords and enabling logins with the touch of finger — and increase security. In order for young startups to be able to get feedback, customers need to be able to trust that their data — whether it’s passwords or payment information — won’t be compromised. This is especially important as devices become increasingly connected and information gets quickly passed around from one service or device to the next. Customers need to trust that if their refrigerator gets hacked, sensitive data like their credit card information won’t be compromised. Finally, this all needs to be connected through an agnostic payments OS — one that isn’t confined to a specific platform — that will enable and authenticate purchases. It’s great that your fridge can ping your smartphone when you’re out of eggs or need to pick up some milk, but imagine if your fridge could seamlessly make the order for you. This in the next step in connected commerce. Today, 1.9 billion devices are already connected to the Internet and it’s estimated that by 2020, we’ll reach 30 billion connected devices globally. As we shift toward a world where our smartphones are now our primary computing devices, we’re moving from what some call an “on-demand world,” to what I see as an “at your service world” – where our devices know what we want, when we want it, and can initiate things on our behalf. From buying through to shipping, technology will be able to deliver these magical experiences without people having to drive the interaction. This is the future of Smart Commerce. Technologies already exist that enable people to pay across mobile apps with a single touch, or make a purchase without even taking out a wallet or phone thanks to beaconing technology. But that’s just the beginning. Soon, our mobile devices – with access to everything from geo-location information to purchase history to biometric data — will know enough about us that they’ll be able to facilitate not just a single transaction, but trigger a chain of transactions and experiences without prompting. Our devices will not only know our past activity, but also learn our habits and routines and begin to anticipate and predict our needs and preferences. Imagine a future where your connected wearable device, which tracks your physical activity, identifies that you haven’t been as active this week as you typically are. As a result, it connects with your grocery and/or meal delivery service and orders healthier, low-calorie options for the week — knowing from your past purchase data that you like carrots and Brussels sprouts but would never eat broccoli. These experiences may seem magical now, but soon they’ll be a routine part of our lives. In fact, earlier this month, Munchery, one of our customers, and Jawbone announced a partnership allowing Munchery customers to track the nutritional data in their meals on their Jawbone Up app. Now it’s not so hard to imagine how a partnership like this could play out in the real world. The connected Internet of Things is rapidly becoming reality. But in order to realize the full potential of a truly connected world, we first need to put into place the foundational fabric on top of which the Internet of Things will exist.

Answer the following question: Information: - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - A PC booter, or booter, is a type of software for home computer era (early 1980s to early 1990s) personal computers that was loaded and executed in the bootup of the computer, from a bootable floppy disk, rather than as a regular program; a booter thus bypassed any operating system that might be installed on the hard disk of the computer. Video games were the type of application most commonly distributed as booters. - Star Warrior is a 1980 science fiction role - playing video game written and published by Automated Simulations ( later known as Epyx ) for the Apple II , TRS - 80 , and Atari home computers . The game was branded as part of the Starquest series , consisting of Star Warrior and the otherwise unrelated Rescue at Rigel . - Jon Freeman was an influential computer game industry figure of the 1980s and early 1990s. He was a co-founder of Epyx and Free Fall Associates and the spouse of game programmer Anne Westfall. Besides founding these two companies, though he is credited with some programming, Freeman is most noted as a game designer. - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). - The TRS-80 Micro Computer System (TRS-80; later known as the Model I to distinguish it from successors) is a desktop microcomputer launched in 1977 and sold by Tandy Corporation through their Radio Shack stores. The name is an abbreviation of \\"Tandy/Radio Shack, Z-80 microprocessor\\". It was one of the earliest mass-produced personal computers. - Epyx, Inc. was a video game developer and publisher active in the late 1970s and 1980s. The company was founded as Automated Simulations by Jim Connelley and Jon Freeman, originally using Epyx as a brand name for action-oriented games before renaming the company to match in 1983. Epyx published a long series of games through the 1980s, but nevertheless went bankrupt in 1989 before finally disappearing in 1993. - Rescue at Rigel is a 1980 science fiction computer role-playing game written and published by Automated Simulations (later known as Epyx). It is based on a modified version of their \\"Temple of Apshai\\" game engine, which was part of most of their releases in this era. The game was released for the Apple II, IBM PC (PC Booter), TRS-80, VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit family. - The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'star warrior' with the relationship of 'designer'.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: A grave of a man dating back to around 2300 BC was found by archaeologists in England On May 3, 2002. Buried with him were the tools of a hunter or warrior. There was a bone pin that may have been from a piece of clothing such as a leather coat. He carried a copper knife on his breast. The most amazing find was two gold earrings. That would have made him a man of distinction. Only a few centimeters from his head were two pots made of clay, tools and materials to make arrows, a bow and a dozen arrows for hunting and a second, smaller copper knife. Next to them lay a cushion stone, upon which the man could work metal. His grave is the richest of any found from that period, because this man was buried with two gold earrings which are the oldest gold ever found in Britain (dated to 2470 BC). Besides, he was buried three miles from Stonehenge. Archaeologists tend to believe he was a member of a powerful class who might have organized the construction of Stonehenge. Stonehenge was begun around 3000 BC. In about 2300 BC the huge stone circles were built. The biggest stone weighed approximately 20 tons. But the smaller blue stones, still weighing 4 tons on average, came from west Wales. It is not yet known how these were conveyed over a distance of 380 km. It is also a mystery how early man was able to construct Stonehenge without the use of modern construction machines and lorries. He is an example of people who brought culture and new techniques from the European mainland to Britain. In terms of technical development people were going from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age and then to the Iron Age. Question: The man buried in the grave might be _ at that time.
